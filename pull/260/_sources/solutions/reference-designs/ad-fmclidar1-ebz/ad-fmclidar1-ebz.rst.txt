**DAQ Board**

-  High speed data acquisition board containing the AD9094 quad channel ADC and clocking control for the full system. The FMC compliant connector interface means that this board can be connected to the users preferred FPGA development board. The Laser board and AFE board connect directly to this board.
-  :doc:`DAQ Board Design Files and Description </solutions/reference-designs/ad-fmclidar1-ebz/hardware_daq>`

**Laser Board**

-  The laser board is mated to the AFE board for mechanical mounting on an optional tripod stand. It is then connected electrically to the DAQ board using the cable provided.
-  It contains 4 individual lasers with appropriate precision driver and power components for accurate firing of the lasers.
-  To alter the laser Field-of-View custom Fast Axis Collimator optics are available from specialist optics suppliers.
-  :doc:`Laser Board Design Files and Description </solutions/reference-designs/ad-fmclidar1-ebz/hardware_laser>`

**AFE Board**

-  The AFE board contains a 16 channel APD from First Sensor and four ADI LTC6561 Quad channel TIA's with necessary power and timing signal chains. Custom optics can be fitted to the board using industry standard mounting adapters based on individual use cases.

   :width: 300

The Lidar Prototyping Platform software framework is common across all hardware
variants, developed with industry standard tools and interfaces. The necessary
parameters are exposed for customers to develop their own proprietary solutions.
Support is provided to cover a broad base of operating systems used across
different industry areas. There is a proven ADI JESD framework available to
reduce development complexity and time, and guarantees deterministic transfer of
data from the APD to the host processing system.

Laser Safety
------------

.. important::

   This device complies with International Standards IEC 60825-1:2014 & 2007 for
   a Class 1 laser product. This device also complies with 21 CFR 1040.10 and
   1040.11 except for deviations pursuant to Laser Notice No. 50, dated June 24,
   2007. Only use Software and Firmware updates that are specifically provided
   for this solution.

Example
-------

As an example to prove out the overall system functionality a demo using select
optics was chosen to have the capability to detect an object of approximately 1m
x 1m in size at 60m range with 50% reflective characteristic.

-  For the AFE Board a 1"(25.4mm) diameter lens, option from Thorlabs LA1951-B-N-BK7, was chosen (included in the box)
-  For the laser board a custom Fast Axis Collimator optic was selected to narrow the vertical FoV from 30°(natural dispersion of the laser) down to 1° to help achieve the 60m range. Mounting of these lenses requires a custom lens holder and also active lens alignment fitting during the manufacturing process. This was done at `FISBA <https://www.fisba.com/>`_, a worldwide leading supplier of customized optical components, systems and microsystems with locations across Europe and in the US.
-  The lasers were driven at 50KHz with a pulse width of 20ns
