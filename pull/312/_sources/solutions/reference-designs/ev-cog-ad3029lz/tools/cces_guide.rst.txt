Cross Core Embedded Studio Quickstart User Guide for EV-COG-AD3029WZ
====================================================================

.. note::

   There is no separate tool chain or software packs for EV-COG-AD3029WZ, the
   tool chain and software packs for EV-COG-AD3029LZ is compatible with
   EV-COG-AD3029WZ, except some pin map changes

This page describes how to use the ADuCM302x Device Family Pack (DFP) with
CrossCore Embedded Studio (CCES) to create, import, build and debug applications
for the ADuCM302x processor. The ADuCM302x MCU integrates an ARM Cortex-M3
processor with various on-chip peripherals within a single package.

.. note::

   ADuCM302x family has two versions of the device, ADuCM3027 and ADuCM3029, the
   DFP supports both these versions

This page describes how to install and work with the Analog Devices ADuCM302x
DFP to start developing applications for the EV-COG-AD3029WZ.

Additional help documentation can be found by opening CCES and selecting "Help
Contents" from the CCES Help menu.

Workspace and Projects
======================

A CCES workspace is a folder (e.g. c:\\Users\\anon\\cces\\2.6.0) that contains
project resources and metadata. When projects are created or imported, details
about that project are stored in the workspace. The workspace metadata also
includes preferences set through the CCES Preferences dialog box and IDE window
layouts. By default, CCES creates new projects within your workspace folder.

Each time you start CCES, you will be prompted for a workspace location. You can
opt to default to a workspace directory by choosing to use a workspace directory
as your default. You will not be prompted the next time you open CCES.

ADuCM3029 Board Support Packs (BSP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EV-COG-AD3029WZ/LZ Board Support Pack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EV-COG-AD3029LZ Board Support Pack (BSP) provides the drivers for off-chip
peripherals which are on the EV-COG-AD3029LZ Evaluation Board and examples for
peripherals on the ADcCM3029 processor. The drivers and examples in the BSP are
designed to work with CrossCore Embedded Studio and the ADuCM302x Device Family
Pack (DFP).

For more information on the EV-COG-AD3029LZ BSP, please refer to the User's
Guide in the Documents folder (e.g. C:\\Analog Devices\\CrossCore Embedded
Studio
2.6.0\\ARM\\packs\\AnalogDevices\\EV-COG-AD3029LZ_BSP\\1.0.0\\Documents\\EV-COG-AD3029LZ_Users_Guide.pdf)

ADI Sensor Software Pack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADI Sensor Software pack contains various sensor software components and
associated examples. The examples in the sensor pack are designed to work with
EV-COG-AD3029WZ board and associated sensor shields. ADI Sensor Software
requires CrossCore Embedded Studio (CCES), ADuCM302x Device Family Pack (DFP)
and EV-COG-AD3029LZ Board Support Pack (BSP).

For more information on the ADI Sensor Software Pack, please refer to the User's
Guide in the Documents folder (e.g. C:\\Analog Devices\\CrossCore Embedded
Studio
2.6.0\\ARM\\packs\\AnalogDevices\\ADI-SensorSoftware\\1.0.0\\Documents\\SensorSoftware_Users_Guide.pdf)

How to create a new project for the ADuCM3029
---------------------------------------------

A project for ADuCM3029 can be created using the New CrossCore Project Wizard.
This wizard will guide you through the steps to create a new project.

.. image:: ../images/eval-aducm3029-project-new.png
   :align: center

-  To create a new project, go to the menu bar and find *File -> New -> CrossCore Project*.
-  Choose Processor family ARM and select Processor type ADuCM3029.
-  Choose your Silicon revision (default is 1.0).

   -  A *SILICON_REVISION* macro will be set in your project's Tools Settings, allowing you to conditionally check the silicon revision in your source code.

-  Project configuration allows you to add additional Add-ins to your project, such as Pin Multiplexing and changing the template language for a generated main function etc.
-  Finally, press *Finish* and the project will be created and you can begin writing your program.

How to add startup code and core components to a new project for the ADuCM3029
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An out-of-the-box ADuCM3029 project does not have startup code or a linker
description file that maps code and data. It is necessary to add these
components using the Run-time Environment (RTE) Configuration Editor.

CrossCore Projects created for Analog Devices' Cortex-M based processors, such
as ADuCM3029 include a system.rteconfig file. Opening this file within the IDE
will open the RTE Configuration Editor. Components from the CMSIS-Pack, such as
drivers and services, can be added to a project by selecting them in the editor
and clicking Save.

At minimum, a new ADuCM3029 project will require the Device::Startup,
CMSIS::Core and Device::Global Configuration components to be added to the
project.

-  Double-click on the system.rteconfig to open the RTE Configuration Editor.
-  Select Device::Startup, CMSIS::Core and Device::Global Configuration.
-  Click Save (Ctrl+S)
-  *You can also choose Device::Startup and click the Resolve button to add dependant components*

How to import existing projects into your workspace
---------------------------------------------------

There are three(3) methods for importing existing projects:

-  Examples that you have saved to a local drive on your PC.
-  Examples that come with the ADuCM3029 Device Family Pack (DFP).
-  Examples which are in the EV-COG-AD3029LZ GIT repository (most up to date
   content).

How to Import Existing Projects Saved to a Local Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Select *File \| Import...* from the CCES menu.
-  A dialog will pop-up with several importing options, choose the *General \| Existing Projects into Workspace* option, and click Next
-  Select *Browse* in the dialog window and search for the saved project which is on your local drive.
-  (Optional) If the *Copy projects into workspace* option is checked, the project will be copied to your workspace folder and the newly copied project will be opened and used. This preserves the original version of the project.
-  Click *Finish*

How to configure the debug session for an ADuCM3029 application
---------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to create a launch configuration to debug your ADuCM3029 program.

-  If you have already built a project, select that project in the Project Explorer View.
-  Right-click on the project and choose *Debug As* and *Application with GDB and OpenOCD (Emulator)*
-  In the *Target* tab, choose *Target (processor)* and in the drop-down select **Analog Devices ADuCM3029**
-  In the *Target* tab, choose *Interface* and in the drop-down select **ARM CMSIS-DAP compliant adapter**
-  In the *Main* tab, ensure that your project is selected in the *Project* entry box.

   -  If the correct project is not populated, click the *Browse...* button and choose the project. Note that this is optional and you only need to choose a project if you want the IDE to search a project for the built binaries (programs), otherwise you can leave this entry blank.

-  In the *Main* tab, ensure your binary (program) is selected in the *Application* entry box.

   -  If the correct binary (program) is not populated, click on *Search Project...* and choose the binary (program) from those available in the chosen project.
   -  If your binary (program) is not populated and it was not built from a project in your workspace (i.e. you have a pre-built binary), then click the *Browse...* button and search for your pre-built binary (program). Click *Open* when you have found and selected the pre-built binary (program).

-  If your binary (program) was built with semi-hosting enabled, then CCES will
   warn you that you need to re-build the program when you want to run the
   program without a debugger attached.

.. image:: ../images/eval-aducm3029-debug-semi-hosting.png
   :align: center

-  To disable semi-hosting in your program, visit your project Tools Settings.
-  Change the *semi-hosting support* option under *Linker \| Libraries* to nosys.specs or None, depending on whether or not your program is currently using semi-hosting (e.g. printf).
-  After configuring your project, click Apply and/or OK.
-  Right click on the project and select the *Build Project*.

   -  Or click the *Hammer* icon from the toolbar.

-  Your program's execution is stopped automatically at the first breakpoint
   which is at the beginning of main() loop. You can use the debug functions and
   features of the CCES environment. (Such as stepping through, breakpoints,
   register reads, variable values, etc.)
