Introduction
============

The :adi:`EV-COG-AD3029` is a modular Internet of Things (IOT) development platform based on the :adi:`ADUCM3029` ultra low power microcontroller (MCU) with integrated power management for processing, control, and connectivity. The MCU system is based on the ARM Cortex-M3 processor, a collection of digital peripherals, embedded SRAM and flash memory, and an analog subsystem which provides clocking, reset, and power management capability in addition to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) subsystem. The :adi:`ADUCM3029` has industry leading ultra low power which makes it ideal for developing battery powered and self powered wireless sensor nodes. The *Cog* platform uses CrossCore Embedded Studio, an open source Eclipse based Interactive Development Environment (IDE), which can be downloaded free of charge. The platform contains many hardware and software example projects to make it easier for customers to prototype and create connected systems and solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

The *Cog* IOT development platform is modular in nature and comprises of:

-  An MCU *Cog* (such as the :doc:`EV-COG-AD3029LZ </solutions/reference-designs/ev-cog-ad3029lz/cog_hw_userguide>`) which has an on-board debugger and test-points for monitoring energy consumption.
-  An optional connectivity *Cog* (such as the `EV-COG-BLEINTP1Z <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/ev-cog-bleintp1z>`_) which offers BTLE, LPWAN or WiFi connectivity options.
-  An optional application specific add-on board (*Gear*) which might have an optimized sensor signal chain, specific to the use-case. For example - an add-on board targeted at smart agriculture use-cases might have Light, Temperature and Humidity Sensors. For initial prototyping, a specialized Gear is available which provides access to Arduino and PMOD connectors in addition to debug connectors - see `EV-GEAR-EXPANDER1Z <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/ev-gear-expander1z>`_.

This modular nature is depicted in the concept sketches below.
