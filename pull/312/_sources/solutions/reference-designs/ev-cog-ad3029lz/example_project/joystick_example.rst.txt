JOYSTICK INTERFACE WITH EV-COG-AD3029LZ
=======================================

Introduction
------------

This document explains about the hardware and software setup, which is required
to interface a joystick with the EV-COG-AD3029LZ using MCP23S17 as an
interfacing I/O expander chip. The entire setup is made simple with the use of
AD-GEAR-DISPLAY1Z, which contains the joystick and the expander IC.

The hardware details cover the COG jumper settings and also the pin mapping
between the joystick, MCP23S17 expander and the EV-COG-AD3029LZ. The software
details cover the software development kit required and the software
architecture of the code base written to interface the joystick with the
EV-COG-AD3029LZ.

- The joystick and the I/O expander-MCP23s17 are embedded on the
  AD-GEAR-DISPLAY1Z.

Board Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect the AD-GEAR-DISPLAY1Z via it’s Cog connectors to the
   EV-COG-AD3029LZ’s expansion connectors.

- A0, A1 and A2 of the I/O expander are connected to the ground.

- RESET_N of the I/O expander is connected to EXT_VDD_OUT of the COG board.

Software Details
----------------

This section contains software related information about AD-GEAR-DISPLAY1Z and
the EV-COG-AD3029-LZ and the application. Links are provided to the user guides,
BSPs, software tool chains and the example project at the end of this page.

Application files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example project provided consists mainly of the following,

-  mcp23s17_3.c
-  mcp23s17.h
-  SPI_PE.h
-  adi_spi_pe.h
-  IAR project files( \*.eww, \*.ewt, \*.ewt)
-  The application uses the ADuCM302x-Rel 2.0.0 driver BSP for IAR.
-  IAR Embedded Workbench 7.60.1 or higher is advised to be used.

Application flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../images/joystick_flow.png
   :width: 800

- All the APIs for using the I/O expander is within the mcp23s17_3.c with
  supporting definitions found in SPI_PE.h and adi_spi_pe.h. A separate driver
  file to use the I/O expander is yet to be created.

IDE Setup and example application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section covers the various steps involved in getting the joystick_example
application code to run on EV-COG-AD3029LZ after the hardware setup is done.

Following are the steps involved,

-  Download and install IAR Embedded Workbench 7.60.1 or higher.
-  Download the joystick_example project from `joystick_example.zip <../resources/joystick_example.zip>`_
-  The joystick_example project is also available on `Bitbucket <https://wiki.analog.com/link_to_bitbucket_has_to_be_put_here>`_.
-  Import the source into IAR workspace and run the application software to
   generate interrupts by joystick press.
