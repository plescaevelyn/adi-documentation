Theoretical Concepts and Practical Foundations
----------------------------------------------

Typical Customer Design Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Software-defined radio development follows a progressive, stage-based approach that takes designs from initial research through to production deployment. 
The key advantage of ADI's approach is that the **same HDL, software, and infrastructure components are used throughout the entire flow**, 
reducing the learning curve and development risk at each stage.

.. figure:: images/theoretical_content/customer_design_flow.png
   :alt: Customer Design Flow
   :align: center
   :width: 40em

   Typical Customer Design Flow

The typical customer design flow consists of 5 progressive stages, each building upon the previous one.

In the **research** phase, engineers validate that the chosen ADI device meets application requirements through simulation and measurement. 

Key activities include:

* **Behavioral Simulation**: Model the system before building hardware
* **Device Evaluation**: Test actual hardware performance using evaluation boards
* **Measurements**: Characterize critical performance metrics such as SFDR (Spurious-Free Dynamic Range), SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), EVM (Error Vector Magnitude), NF (Noise Figure), and NSD (Noise Spectral Density)

Tools used: Evaluation boards, IIO Oscilloscope, ACE software, bench test equipment.

During the **Algorithm Development** phase, engineers implement signal processing algorithms using high-level languages while streaming real data from hardware.
Here, the focus is on rapid prototyping and validation of algorithms in realistic conditions via **MATLAB/Python/GRC Reference Implementation**, **Hardware Streaming**, 
and **Iterative Development**.

Development environments at this stage include `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_/`Simulink <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html>`_ with ADI toolboxes, `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ with `PyADI-IIO <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio>`_, `GNU Radio Companion <https://www.gnuradio.org/>`_ with `gr-iio <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-iio>`_ blocks.

The **Design Elaboration** phase refines algorithms for embedded deployment through modeling and optimization. This stage include modeling using the same
development tools, validating optimized algorithms with real hardware data, and transitioning from floating-point to fixed-point arithmetic 
for efficient hardware implementation.

Critical considerations include fixed-point precision, filter coefficient quantization, timing budgets, and FPGA resource utilization.

While *prototyping*, algorithms are deployed to development hardware for integration and optimization. This stage includes:

* **Deployment to Development Board**: Move algorithms to actual hardware (PlutoSDR, Jupiter, or FMC boards)
* **Design Optimization**: Tune for performance and resource efficiency
* **HDL Integration**: Integrate custom signal processing with ADI reference designs

The final stage, **Production**, includes deployment to custom hardware with complete system validation.

Throughout all stages, the same HDL IP cores, Linux kernel drivers, and application software are reused, dramatically reducing development risk and time-to-market.

      Single cohesive software solution supporting multiple user personas and tools

** Product Evaluation** uses hardware and software tools to verify that the Converter meets Application requirements.

Time investment is (very roughly) proportional to complexity and how application specific it needs to be

**Tools:** `IIO Oscilloscope <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`_, `ACE software <https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-development-platforms/ace-software.html>`_, `Scopy <https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/m2k/scopy>`_, bench test equipment


Algorithmic Development, Modeling and Prototyping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Product Prototyping** provides Plug 'n' Play hardware and software to see the key features and performance of the part.

It can configure, capture signals, or generate waveforms in 10-15 minutes, stream real data from hardware into development 
environments (MATLAB, Python, GNU Radio) and develop and validate algorithms with hardware-in-the-loop

**Development Environments:** `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_/`Simulink <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html>`_, `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_/`PyADI-IIO <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio>`_, `GNU Radio Companion <https://www.gnuradio.org/>`_

**Tools:** `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_/`Simulink <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html>`_, `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_/`PyADI-IIO <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio>`_, `GNU Radio <https://www.gnuradio.org/>`_


Building Blocks for Development and New Revenue Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ADI's modular architecture provides reusable building blocks that accelerate development and create opportunities for new applications and revenue streams.

.. figure:: images/theoretical_content/building_blocks.png
   :alt: Building Blocks for Development
   :align: center
   :width: 40em

   Modular building blocks

Modular building blocks enable rapid development and platform scalability. Signal processing components including filters, decimators, interpolators, 
and other DSP primitives are standard offerings that accelerate algorithm implementation. Protocol implementations such as OFDM, QPSK, and FSK 
are pre-implemented for rapid deployment, while pre-validated HDL provides high-performance streaming and buffering for demanding applications.

Efficient clock and power distribution features enable portable and battery-powered applications. Multiple libraries and frameworks provide flexible
hardware access and algorithm development: `PyADI-IIO <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio>`_ for rapid Python prototyping with hardware-in-the-loop, `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_ and `Simulink <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html>`_ toolboxes for system-level
modeling and deployment, `GNU Radio <https://www.gnuradio.org/>`_ `gr-iio <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gr-iio>`_ blocks for flowgraph-based signal processing, and standardized Linux drivers that reduce integration effort.

The business benefits are compelling. Faster time-to-market results from pre-validated components that reduce development cycles, while proven building 
blocks minimize integration challenges and eliminate redundant design work through IP reuse. Platform scalability allows you to start with ADALM-PLUTO 
and scale seamlessly to production platforms.

Revenue opportunities emerge through application-specific solutions for vertical markets, proprietary algorithm development, custom hardware transitions 
with unified software stacks, and IP licensing of optimized implementations.

Common Architecture for Easy Platform Transition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The common architecture across ADI's platforms makes it easy to transition between hardware as your project evolves from prototype to production.

   .. figure:: images/theoretical_content/common_architecture.png
      :alt: Common Architecture Makes It Easy to Transition Between Platforms
      :align: center
      :width: 40em

   Common architecture enables seamless transitions between platforms

**Shared Software and HDL Stack:**

* **Same libraries**: libiio, PyADI-IIO, and hardware drivers work across all platforms
* **Common Linux image**: ADI Kuiper Linux brings up the same software stack whether on a laptop or embedded board
* **Unified HDL**: Common FPGA designs across all SDR platforms
* **Consistent drivers**: Same drivers whether accessing hardware locally or via USB

**Platform Progression:**

* **Start with `ADALM-PLUTO <https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html>`_**: Provides quick verification, rapid algorithm development, and SIGINT applications at very low cost
* **Scale to production**: Same software and HDL seamlessly transfer to higher-performance platforms
* **Use modules for clean design**: Leverage ADI's reference designs and IP cores

**Open Source Repositories:**

* Common Linux kernel and drivers: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/linux
* Common HDL IP cores: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl

This architecture ensures that code developed on entry-level hardware like ADALM-PLUTO can be reused on production platforms with minimal changes, dramatically reducing development risk and time-to-market.

Hands on exercises
------------------

Transmit and receive a complex sinusoid  with Python using Pluto SDR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A complex sinusoid is a fundamental building block in software-defined radio. Unlike a real sinusoid
(which oscillates in a single dimension), a complex sinusoid consists of two components:

* **In-phase (I) component**: Real part of the signal
* **Quadrature (Q) component**: Imaginary part of the signal

Together, they form a single tone in the frequency domain. This exercise transmits a complex sinusoid
at 20 kHz and receives it back via a loopback connection, allowing you to observe both the transmitted
signal and its frequency spectrum representation.

#. Go to **python->sinewave_loopback** subfolder.

#. Right click on **python_loopback_sine_pluto.py -> Open with Other Application** and 
   select **Thonny Python IDE** (or any other Python IDE you have installed) from the 
   Recommended Applications list.

Transmit and receive a complex sinusoid with Python using Jupiter or Talise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise demonstrates one of the most powerful features of ADI's software ecosystem: **platform portability**.
You will run the same complex sinusoid transmission and reception algorithm from the previous exercise, but now
on higher-performance hardware platforms—Jupiter (ADRV9002) or Talise (ADRV9009-ZU11EG).

**Key Learning Points:**

* **Minimal code changes**: Only the device configuration section needs to be modified
* **Same PyADI-IIO library**: The identical Python library works across all ADI platforms
* **Common software architecture**: tx(), rx(), and other functions remain the same
* **Seamless scaling**: Move from prototyping on Pluto to production-grade hardware without rewriting algorithms

This demonstrates the design principle discussed earlier: algorithms developed on entry-level hardware like
ADALM-PLUTO can be directly transferred to production platforms with minimal effort, dramatically reducing
development time and risk.

In this exercise, you will observe that only the SDR configuration code (approximately 10-15 lines) changes
between platforms, while the signal generation, transmission, reception, and visualization code remains identical.

Follow these steps:

#. Assuming the lab exercise folder is already downloaded and unzipped on your desktop, go to **workshop_exercises->python->sinewave_loopback** 
subfolder, open **python_loopback_sine_pluto.py (for Jupiter)** or **python_loopback_sine_talise_zu11eg.py (for Talise)** using **Thonny Python IDE**
as described in the previous exercise.

#. Observe in the script where only the "Configure SDR" code section was changed in **python_loopback_sine_jupiter.py** and **python_loopback_sine_talise_zu11eg.py** 
compared to **python_loopback_sine_pluto.py** from *Figure 6*. This is because the same software and HDL building blocks are used across all platforms, 
making it easy to transition between them.

#. Insert the IP address on line 12 for Jupiter (in **python_loopback_sine_jupiter.py**) or for Talise (in **python_loopback_sine_talise_zu11eg.py**) 
to remotely connect to Jupiter or Talise.

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ # For Jupiter (in python_loopback_sine_jupiter.py):
      $ sdr = adi.adrv9002(uri="ip:10.48.65.212") # Create Radio object for Jupiter

      $ # For Talise (in python_loopback_sine_talise_zu11eg.py):
      $ sdr = adi.adrv9009_zu11eg("ip:10.48.65.182") # Create Radio object for Talise

#. Run the script as indicated in *Figure 7*. In this example, a sinusoid at 15.360 KHz is transmitted and received. 
This frequency is chosen to have an integer number of periods of the sine at the sample rate of 15.36 Msps. 
More specifically, line 16 (depicted below) should return an integer number.

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ num_samps = int((20*sample_rate)/frequency) # number of samples per call to rx()

#. To zoom on the generated figures, use the instructions shown in *Figure 8*.

#. To stop running the Python script or if you want to run it again, use the instructions shown in *Figure 10*.


Doppler Radar with GNU Radio (Pluto)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise demonstrates the Doppler radar effect using GNU Radio Companion, a visual programming environment
for building software-defined radio applications. You will create a continuous-wave (CW) radar system that can
detect motion and measure relative velocity by observing frequency shifts in the received signal.

**What is GNU Radio?**

GNU Radio is a free, open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement
software-defined radios. It uses a visual flowgraph paradigm where signal processing blocks are connected together
to create complete radio systems. GNU Radio Companion (GRC) provides a graphical interface for building these flowgraphs
without requiring extensive programming knowledge.

**Key features:**

* Visual flowgraph-based development environment
* Extensive library of signal processing blocks
* Hardware integration via gr-iio blocks for ADI devices
* Real-time visualization and debugging tools

**The Doppler Effect in Radar**

The Doppler effect causes a frequency shift when there is relative motion between the radar and a target.
When an object moves toward the radar, the reflected signal has a higher frequency (positive Doppler shift).
When it moves away, the frequency decreases (negative Doppler shift).

**Doppler Frequency Shift:**

.. math::

   f_d = \frac{2 \cdot v \cdot f_c}{c}

where:

* :math:`f_d` = Doppler frequency shift
* :math:`v` = relative velocity of the target
* :math:`f_c` = carrier frequency
* :math:`c` = speed of light

**How This Exercise Works:**

#. **Transmit**: The Pluto SDR transmits a continuous wave (CW) signal at 2.5 GHz
#. **Reflection**: The signal reflects off your moving hand
#. **Receive**: The Pluto receives the reflected signal with a Doppler-shifted frequency
#. **Processing**: GNU Radio processes the signal to extract the Doppler shift
#. **Visualization**: Real-time plots show the frequency shift, and audio output lets you hear the Doppler tone

      Frequency domain filtering: Band Reject Filter removes carrier, Band Pass Filter isolates Doppler shift

**What You Will Observe:**

* Moving your hand toward the antenna increases the frequency (higher pitch sound)
* Moving away decreases the frequency (lower pitch sound)
* The faster the motion, the larger the frequency shift
* Real-time FFT plots visualize the Doppler shift

This is the same principle used in police speed radar guns, weather radar, and automotive collision avoidance systems.

Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) in Python using Pluto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise demonstrates Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), a fundamental digital modulation technique used in modern communication systems. You will transmit digital data (binary bits) through the Pluto SDR, receive it back via a loopback connection, and observe how software-based signal processing recovers the original data despite real-world impairments.

**What is BPSK?**

Binary Phase Shift Keying is a type of phase modulation where digital information is encoded by shifting the phase of a carrier signal. In BPSK:

* **Bit 0** is represented by a phase of 180° (or -1 in the I/Q plane)
* **Bit 1** is represented by a phase of 0° (or +1 in the I/Q plane)

This creates two distinct constellation points on the real axis of the I/Q diagram, making BPSK one of the most robust digital modulation schemes against noise.

**Where is BPSK Used?**

BPSK and its variants are used in numerous communication systems:

* **GSM** - Mobile phone networks
* **Satellite Television** - DVB-S and other satellite broadcasting standards
* **Wi-Fi** - Lower data rate modes (802.11b DSSS)
* **GPS and GNSS** - Satellite navigation systems
* **RFID and NFC** - Contactless communication
* **Deep space communications** - Where robustness is critical

**Challenges in Demodulating BPSK Signals**

When receiving BPSK signals in real-world conditions, several impairments must be corrected:

* **Phase Offset**: The local oscillator (LO) at the receiver may have a phase difference from the transmitter
* **Frequency Offset**: Small differences in carrier frequency between TX and RX oscillators
* **Timing Offset**: Clock differences require symbol timing recovery to sample at the right moment
* **Variation with time, distance, and temperature**: These offsets change dynamically

As demonstrated in the previous Doppler radar exercise, frequency varies with distance and motion. These same effects impact digital communications.

**The Power of Software-Defined Radio: All These Problems Can Be Solved by Software!**

This exercise demonstrates how modern SDR systems correct all these impairments in software using sophisticated algorithms:

      :align: center
      :width: 40em

      BPSK system architecture showing transmitter and receiver signal processing chain (slide 5 - flowchart diagram)

**How the BPSK System Works:**

**Transmitter Chain:**

#. **Configure SDR**: Set center frequency, sample rate, and gain
#. **Create array of bits**: Generate the digital data to transmit (0s and 1s)
#. **Interpolate and remap symbols**: Repeat each bit 16 times for pulse shaping, map bit 0 → -1, bit 1 → +1
#. **Call tx() function**: Transmit the modulated signal

**Receiver Chain:**

#. **Call rx() function**: Receive the modulated signal
#. **Coarse frequency adjustment**: Square the received signal to measure 2× frequency offset, then correct it
#. **Symbol timing recovery**: Use Mueller and Muller clock recovery to select the correct sample from each 16-sample group
#. **Fine frequency and phase adjustment**: Apply Costas loop to lock onto the correct phase and remove residual frequency offset
#. **Plot data**: Visualize constellation diagrams and waveforms to observe signal quality

**Key Signal Processing Techniques:**

* **Frequency Offset Correction**: The received signal is squared (raising phase errors to become visible as frequency offsets), an FFT identifies the peak at 2× the offset frequency, and samples are corrected by multiplying by :math:`e^{-j2\pi f_{offset} t}`

* **Symbol Timing Recovery (Mueller and Muller)**: Since each bit is transmitted as 16 samples, the receiver must identify which of the 16 samples represents the optimal sampling point. The Mueller and Muller algorithm iteratively adjusts the timing offset to lock onto the correct samples.

* **Costas Loop (Fine Synchronization)**: Functions like a phase-locked loop (PLL) that multiplies I × Q samples. For ideal BPSK where Q = 0, this error function is minimized when there is no phase or frequency offset, allowing the loop to lock onto the correct carrier phase.

**What You Will Observe:**

Starting from a noisy, offset constellation with scattered points, you will see the signal progressively improve:

#. **Raw received signal**: Shows significant phase and frequency offset
#. **After coarse frequency correction**: Frequency offset mostly removed, but phase offset remains
#. **After symbol timing recovery**: Correct samples selected, reducing mid-constellation points
#. **After Costas loop**: Clean constellation with two tight clusters at -1 and +1

      Progression from noisy received signal to clean demodulated constellation

This exercise demonstrates the power of software-defined radio: complex signal processing algorithms running in software can correct real-world impairments that would be difficult or impossible to handle in analog hardware alone.

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) in GNU Radio using Pluto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise demonstrates Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), a digital modulation scheme that transmits 2 bits per symbol instead of BPSK's 1 bit per symbol. QPSK uses four phase positions in the I/Q plane to encode data, effectively doubling the data rate in the same bandwidth.

**What is QPSK?**

QPSK encodes two bits into each symbol using four constellation points at 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°:

* **00**, **01**, **10**, **11** → Four distinct phase positions

This creates twice the spectral efficiency of BPSK while maintaining good noise immunity.

* Cable modems (DOCSIS)
* Point-to-point microwave links

Receiving QPSK modulated Video with SDRs using Pluto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise demonstrates a real-world application of QPSK modulation: receiving Digital Amateur Television (DATV). Using the open-source `SDRangel <https://www.sdrangel.org/>`_ software, you will receive and display live video transmitted over the air using QPSK modulation, the same technique used in satellite TV broadcasting.

**What is DATV?**

Digital Amateur Television (DATV) is a form of amateur radio that transmits video and audio using digital modulation schemes like QPSK. Unlike analog TV, DATV provides:

* Better quality with less interference
* More efficient use of bandwidth
* Error correction capabilities
* Multiple audio/video streams in a single channel

**How This Exercise Works:**

`SDRangel <https://www.sdrangel.org/>`_ is a powerful open-source SDR application that implements a complete DATV receiver chain including QPSK demodulation, Forward Error Correction (FEC), and MPEG-2/H.264 video decoding. The Pluto SDR receives the RF signal, and SDRangel processes it to display the video in real-time.

Follow these steps to receive QPSK-modulated video:

#. Make the following setup using Pluto and connect it to your PC:

#. Open the terminal by pressing at the same time **Ctrl + Alt + T** on your keyboard.

#. Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ sdrangel

#. The application should be preconfigured. Run the program by pressing the purple arrow as depicted below.

Spectrum Paint using Pluto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise demonstrates a creative application of SDR: "painting" images in the frequency spectrum. By transmitting signals at different frequencies over time, you can create visible patterns on a waterfall display, which shows frequency on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis.

**How Spectrum Paint Works:**

A waterfall display is a spectrogram that shows:

* **Frequency** (horizontal axis): Different colors represent signal strength at each frequency
* **Time** (vertical axis): Each new row represents a new time snapshot
* **Amplitude** (color intensity): Brighter colors indicate stronger signals

By carefully controlling which frequencies are transmitted at each moment, you can "draw" images, text, or patterns that become visible as the waterfall scrolls down.

**Applications:**

While spectrum paint is primarily a demonstration, the underlying technique is used in:

* Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
* Chirp radar systems
* Multi-carrier communications
* Signal identification and watermarking

This exercise showcases the flexibility of software-defined radio: the same hardware can transmit any arbitrary frequency pattern by simply changing the software.

Follow these steps to create a spectrum painting:

#. Make the following setup using Pluto and connect it to your PC.

#. Open in *gnuradio-companion* the **paint_tx.grc** file from **workshop_exercises->gnuradio->spectrum_paint** and run the flowgraph.

#. Observe the waterfall display as the spectrum painting appears, created by the Pluto SDR transmitting the frequency pattern.
