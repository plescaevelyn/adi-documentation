EVAL-CN0518-EBZ
===============

USB-Powered, 915 MHz RF Low Noise Amplifier Receiver with Overpower Protection Circuit.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0518-EBZ <CN0518>` is a USB-powered, RF power
amplifier that is optimized for receiving signal chains in the 915 MHz ISM band.
Using two :adi:`HMC376` amplifiers cascaded together, the design
provides a gain of 25dB and return losses of more than 10dB at its center
frequency.

The circuit includes a high speed overpower cutoff that protects sensitive
downstream equipment connected to the receiver system. The receiver system also
automatically returns to normal operation when the RF power level drops within
the acceptable range.

Designed to be used with the :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO`, the
:adi:`EVAL-CN0518-EBZ <CN0518>` features a small form factor with
dimensions of 25.4mm×49.6mmx1.5748mm (PCB only). The RF input and output
are designed with a 50Ω impedance, enabling direct connection between the
circuit and standard 50Ω systems.

A micro-USB connector is used for the input power, allowing the evaluation board
to use most 5V wall wart power supplies available in the market.

   EVAL-CN0518-EBZ Reference Design Board

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0518-EBZ <CN0518>` features the :adi:`HMC376`,
which is a GaAs, pHEMT, MMIC, low noise amplifier
operating between 700MHz to 1000MHz. This amplifier is ideal for use in GSM
and CDMA cellular base station front end receivers. This low noise amplifier
does not require any external matching circuitry to operate.

LED Indicators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference design uses two LEDs to indicate its current status:

============= ==================== =============================================
RF Port       Reference Designator Description
============= ==================== =============================================
**Green LED** DS1                  Indicates that power is present on the board
**Red LED**   DS2                  Indicates when an overpower event occurs
============= ==================== =============================================

This table shows the board status when the various LEDs are ON/OFF.

========= ======= ======================================
Green LED Red LED Board Status
========= ======= ======================================
OFF       OFF     No Power
ON        OFF     Normal RF Operation
ON        ON      Overpower Event (RF Output Attenuated)
========= ======= ======================================

Power Supply Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **P1** is the micro-USB port used to provide 5V power to the board.

Getting Started
---------------

Required Equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware
^^^^^^^^

ADALM-PLUTO Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the step-by-step process on how to configure the ADALM-PLUTO for proper
operation by referring to this
:dokuwiki:`link </university/tools/pluto/users/firmware>`.

Test Setup
~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: test_setup.png

   EVAL-CN0518-EBZ Test Setup

#. Connect directly the **Rx port** of :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO` to
   **J1** of the :adi:`EVAL-CN0518-EBZ <CN0518>`.
#. Connect the **Tx port** of the :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO` to **J2** of
   the :adi:`EVAL-CN0518-EBZ <CN0518>` using a male-to-male SMA cable.
#. Connect **P1** (micro-USB) connector of the
   :adi:`EVAL-CN0518-EBZ <CN0518>` into a PC USB port or a 5V USB
   charger.

.. important::
   The :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO` can be configured using an IIO Oscilloscope, visit
   the website on :ref:`iio-oscilloscope` to learn more about the tool.

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Make sure to download or update to the latest version of IIO Oscilloscope
   found on this :git-iio-oscilloscope:`link <releases+>`.

- Once done with the installation or an update of the latest IIO Oscilloscope,
  open the application. The user needs to supply a URI, which will be used in
