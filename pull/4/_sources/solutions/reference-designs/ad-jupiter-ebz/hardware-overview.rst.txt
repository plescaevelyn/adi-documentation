boot option has higher priority than Quad-SPI Flash.

The ZU3EG on-chip SD Controller is compatible with SD memory card
specification version 3.01, supporting UHS-I speeds and SDXC capacity
format. The front panel includes a micro SD card connector.

Multi Gigabit Transceiver (MGTR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

XCZU3EG Zynq Ultrascale+ has 4 GTR channels up to 6Gb/s. The following
table shows the GTR channels usage on Jupiter SDR.

============ ========= =================

User Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

USB
^^^

USB Type-C data connector exposes a DRP (Dual Role Port) USB 3.1 Gen1
interface which operate as either a DFP (Downstream Facing Port) or a
UFP (Upstream Facing Port):

- UFP – it is used to connect Jupiter-SDR (device) to a computer (host)
  for data streaming

- DFP – it is used to connect different USB3 devices to Jupiter-SDR
  (keyboard, mouse, wi-fi, etc.);

- backward compatibility with USB2 interface is supported by USB3320
  transceiver connected over ULPI interface to the PS side of XCZU3EG.

Ethernet
^^^^^^^^

:adi:`ADIN1300` is a 10BASE-Te/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T IEEE 802.3 
compliant Ethernet PHY interfaced to the PS of XCZU3EG through 
RGMII interface.

SATA
^^^^

XCZU3EG supports SATA III – 6Gb/s or 600MB/s. SATA interface is exposed
to the user through an eSATA connector which supports 2.5K mating cycles
and shielded cable.

Display Port
^^^^^^^^^^^^

XCZU3EG supports Display Port 1.2 source-only controller with two lanes
having link data rate of 1.62Gb/s, 2.7Gb/s or 5.4Gbps. Most of the
monitors will achieve 1080p at 60 FPS. It also supports AUX channel for
audio digital signal transfer (720 Mb/s).

.. warning::

    AMD Xilinx provide a list of
    `monitors <https://adaptivesupport.amd.com/s/article/68671?language=en_US>`__
    that were tested and work with the Ultrascale+ Display Port 
    controller.

Debug interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Micro USB connector exposes an UART interface that gives the
   possibility to communicate with Linux running on the XCZU3EG. The
   FT230XQ transceiver is used for USB to UART interfacing.

#. Optionally the user could populate 14 pins JTAG header inside the
   enclosure that allows to do deeper development debug.

GPIOs
^^^^^

We are exposing XCZU3EG IO lines of Bank 26 to a 20 pins (1.27mm pitch)
header on the front panel. The GPIO connector also provide 3.3V supply
rail to the user which is also used to supply the FPGA IO Bank.

- 16 lines independently configurable as inputs or outputs

- 3V3 TTL levels

- ESD protection

- I2C0, SPI0, UART0 could be exposed using EMIO

LEDs and Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Status LED (bi-color red and blue)

- red - at least one of the power sources is present and the board was
  not turned on

- purple (both red and blue turned on) - after turn on it will indicate
  that bitstream was loaded into FPGA

- this LED is hardware controlled

User LED (blue)

- by default it blinks once per second after boot up

- it could be programmed to desired functionality

User button (S1)

- it could be used to enter DFU mode (it makes sense only for FLASH
  boot)

RF Front-end
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Main Board RF front end block diagram is presented in the following
picture.

.. figure:: jupitersdr_rf_fe_main.png
   :align: center

ADRV9002 clock
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Jupiter SDR supports two ADRV9002 clock sources:

#. on-board 38.4MHz oscillator -
   `GTXO-74V/JI <https://www.golledge.com/products/gtxo-74v-low-phase-noise-sm-tcxo-with-voltage-control-and-clipped-sine-output/c-26/p-327>`__
   made by Golledge

#. external clock input exposed to the dedicated SMA connector

   - 50 ohm input

   - input level range from -8dBm to 15.8 dBm

adrv9002_clksrc signal selects ADRV9002 clock source:

- LOW - on-board oscillator (default)

- HIGH - external clock

The adrv9002_clksrc control is implemented in the device tree.

The on-board oscillator GTXO-74V is coming with voltage tune feature
that allows frequency adjustment in the range of +/-8 to +/-14 ppm. The
oscillator has frequency tuning pin connected to AUXDAC3 of ADRV9002
which allows frequency correction algorithms to tune the LO frequency.
The following formula could be used to find required DAC voltage for
desired tune voltage:

.. math:: 
    
    VAUXDAC3 = (2.47V-VTUNE)/1.47

For example if we want VTUNE = 1.5V then we need VAUXDAC3 = 0.659V.

RF FE Main Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main board expose to the front panel two wide band receive channels
RX1A and RX2A which are connected to the ADRV9002 transceiver Rx A
channels. The receive path consist of a by-passable LNA
:adi:`HMC8414`, a non-reflective SPDT
switch :adi:`HMC8038` that allows to
terminate with 50 ohms the RX input during internal calibration and a
`TCM1-83X+ <https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=TCM1-83X%2B>`__
MiniCircuits balun. The control of calibration switch is done by the
driver and is not exposed to the user. The frequency range of the main
board RX1A and RX2A paths is 100 MHz to 6 GHz.

On the main board we have another two receive channels RX1B and RX2B
which are connected to Rx B channels of ADRV9002. These receive channels
are connected to the RF add-on board through uFL cables and also have
the same SPDT switch and balun as on the RX A channels.

The main board also expose to the front panel two transmit channels TX1A
and TX2A which consists of a TCM1-83X+ balun and a three way
non-reflective switch :adi:`ADRF5040`
which allows disconnecting the TX output during internal calibration or
connecting the transmit path to the RF Add-on board. There are some
attributes exposed to the user that allows selecting between TX1A and
TX1B respective TX2A and TX2B.

RF FE Add-on board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The picture below show the block diagram of the RF Add-on board.

.. figure:: jupitersdr_rf_fe_add-on.png
   :align: center

The RF Add-on board expose B receive channels RX1B and RX2B to the front
pannel. The receive path has a by-passable 
`LNA TSY-13LNB+ <https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=TSY-13LNB%2B>`__
with frequency range 10MHz to 1GHz.

TX1B and TX2B channels include just an amplifier
:adi:`HMC8413` that boosts by 20 dB the transmit signal.

RF FE Add-on interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Main Board expose a control interface for the RF Add-on board to a 40

Power
~~~~~

The picture below show the power supply high level block diagram.

.. figure:: jupitersdr_powermap.png
   :align: center

Power Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The board has three power sources:

- USB Type-C (power only) - priority 1

  - power sink - PDO1 9V/3A (default), PDO2 5V/3A

- USB Type-C (data and power) - priority 3

  - power sink - PDO1 5V/3A

  - power source - PDO1 5V/0.9A

- POE - priority 2

  - :adi:`LT4276` - IEEE 802.3at 25.5W Compliant

:adi:`LTC4417` power selector turns on the
highest priority valid power source. The switchover from one power
source to another should not cause the board to reset when total power
consumption of the system does not exceed 15W.

.. warning:: 
    
    When you want to use Jupiter SDR by just connecting one cable to the USB
    Type-C data and power port make sure that your computer’s USB port (or
    docking station) supports 5V and 3A PDO. Jupiter SDR will not boot up
    with 5V and 1.5A PDO.

.. warning:: 
    
    The board is not going to power up if your PSE (Power Source Equipment)
    does not support POE+ (IEEE 802.3at).

System Power on/off
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:adi:`LTC2955` is a push button on/off
controller that manages the power supply enable/disable when the push
button is pressed. A short button press will generate an enable signal
to the power selector which is enabling the appropriate path and the
board powers up. Once the board has booted up a short press of the
button will notify the operating system that power off is desired then
when operating system is ready it will send the shutdwon signal to the
push button controller which in turn will disable the power selector
cutting off the power of the board. When things are not working as
expected it is possible to force a shutdown by pressing the button more
than 5s.

System Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:adi:`LTC2945` measures the input voltage and current consumption of 
the entire board giving the board’s total power consumption.

ZU3EG and ADRV9002 integrated temperature sensors offers the possibility
to monitor system’s hottest parts.

Fan control
^^^^^^^^^^^

The fan could be controlled to be in three states: off, low speed and
high speed. There are two lines that control the fan speed:

- fan_en - enables the fan to spin

- fan_ctl - when the fan is enabled the signal controls the fan speed to
  low speed or high speed.

====== ======= ==========
fan_en fan_ctl fan state
====== ======= ==========
LOW    LOW     off
LOW    HIGH    off
HIGH   LOW     low speed
HIGH   HIGH    high speed
====== ======= ==========

By default the fan is set to low speed. For higher power applications
the fan can be set to high speed by changing the device tree
configuration.
