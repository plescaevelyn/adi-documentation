EV-HT-200CDAQ1 Test Summary
===========================

Extensive testing was performed on several EV-HT-200CDAQ1 boards to assess
typical performance over temperature, along with a 200 hour temperature soak at
200°C ambient. The test results provided here are for guidance on typical
performance only. A large sample size was not used during testing and results
shown do not imply a guaranteed specification.

General Test Setup
------------------

For testing over temperature, the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 was placed in a Tenny TUJR lab
oven, capable of both heating to above 200°C and cooling below -40°C.
Connections to the board were made through ports in the oven using the same
breakout boards included in the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 kit. It should be noted that the
connectors and harness on the breakout boards are suitable for high temperature
exposure, but the breakout boards themselves are not, and they should never be
collocated in a hot ambient environment with the main board.

Data was collected using the HT DAQ Viewer software (:doc:`see the downloads page </solutions/reference-designs/high-temp/ev-ht-200cdaq1/software>`) and other lab instruments that are described in each individual test section.

.. important::

   All test results below were measured with +5VDC Vp /-2.5VDC Vm / +3.3VD power supplies. While a :doc:`3.3VD only power configuration is supported </solutions/reference-designs/high-temp/ev-ht-200cdaq1/hardware>`, the analog input range must be limited to about 1.0Vpp with 1.25V common mode for best performance, due to analog headroom requirements.

   

Power Consumption Profile
-------------------------

Average current consumption was measured on each power rail with digital
multimeters. Power cycle testing was performed at each temperature point

.. important::

   A high power oscillator was used during the characterization phase of this
   project. This has been replaced in the final BOM with a lower power
   oscillator from the same manufacturer. The lower power oscillator saves
   approximately 7mA of current across the temperature range.

Crosstalk
---------

Crosstalk, in simplified terms, is a metric of how much a channel in a data acquisition system is effected by signal(s) on adjacent channel(s). For more information on crosstalk in data converters, see this\ :adi:`"Rarely Asked Questions" article. <en/analog-dialogue/raqs/raq-issue-75.html>`

For this test, a single board was used at room temperature. It was powered with
+5VDC Vp/-2.5VDC Vm / +3.3VDC. A very low distortion signal generature was
connected to a single channel at a time, AC coupled through a 3.3ųF capacitor.
Unused channels were AC terminated to ground with a 3.3ųF capacitor. No
multiplexer channels were switch during acquisition. The sample rate was set at
400ksps, and an 8192 point FFT was used for analysis, captured with the HT DAQ
viewer software. The tables below show signal measurement in dBFS for 1kHz and
10kHz tone inputs. Channel to channel isolation is very good considering that
signals are connected to the board with unshielded single ended wiring and pass
through a Micro-D connector, which is not an connector optimized for signal
integrity.

AC Characterization
-------------------

For this test, SNR and THD were measured on several boards over temperature. The
boards were powered with +5VDC Vp /-2.5VDC Vm / +3.3VDC. A very low distortion
signal generature was connected to a single channel at a time, 1.KHz tone, 2.4
Vpp, AC coupled through a 3.3ųF capacitor. Unused channels were AC terminated to
ground with a 3.3ųF capacitor. No multiplexer channels were switch during
acquisition. The sample rate was set at 400ksps, and an 8192 point FFT was used
for analysis, captured with the HT DAQ viewer software. The plots below show
SNR/SINAD and THD performance for non-multiplexed channels ADC0 and ADC1.

Multiplexed Inputs AC Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiplexed inputs tend introduce a higher level of complexity in the analog
front end design and operation. With proper usage, the multiplexed inputs can
obtain a similar level of performance as the ADC0 and ADC1 channels. However,
there are several factors that must be considered when using the multiplexed
inputs that significantly effect the input signal range and performance.

In the default configuration in which the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 board ships, the ADG798 multiplexer VSS pin is connected to ground. However, the ADG798 input requires about 1V headroom from the Vss, which becomes most apparent above 175°C. For this reason, jumper P3 is included on the board to attach the ADG798 to a negative rail. **However, care must be taken not to exceed the ADG798 Vdd to Vss absolute maximum rating of 7.0V, or the Vss to ground rating of -3.5V.** :doc:`See the hardware design notes section for more information on power configuration options. </solutions/reference-designs/high-temp/ev-ht-200cdaq1/hardware>`

The plot below shows the performance that can be obtained from a multiplexed
channel with ADG798 connected to ground, at 175°C. The input signal level has
been reduced to -9dBFS. There is a corresponding decrease in SNR because of the
decrease input signal level, but it is evident that other performance metrics
still hold up. It should be reiterated that a negative voltage to the MUX VSS
via P3 as described above that similar performance can be obtained with a full
scale input signal as ADC0 and ADC1.

The second factor to keep in mind is the settling time when switching channels.
Full sample rate is supported on this channel when switching between channels is
not required. In multiplexed operation mode, adequate settling time needs to be
provisioned depending on measurement accuracy requirements. For the default
input channel configuration a settling of 5 time constants corresponds to a 3.3
ųs minimum sampling period.

Temperature Soak
----------------

In order to assess long term performance of the EV-HT-200CDAQ1, 2 boards were
soaked for 200 hours at 200°C. One board was powered, one board was unpowered. A
performance benchmark was taken at room temperature on both boards before the
test. The powered unit was continuously running a measurement with the HT DAQ
Viewer software and periodically power cycled. The powered unit functioned as
expected during the soak test and through power cycles. After 200 hours, both
boards were brought back down to room temperature and a functional test was run
again. Both boards passed functional test and there was no notable change in
performance. A picture of both board post temperature soak is shown below.
