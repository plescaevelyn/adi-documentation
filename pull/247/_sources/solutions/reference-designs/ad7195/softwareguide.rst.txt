ACE software Operation
----------------------

Launching the software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the EVAL-AD7195ASDZ and controller board are properly connected to the PC,
launch the ACE software by taking the following steps:

-  From the Start menu of the PC, select All Programs > Analog Devices > ACE> ACE.exe to open the ACE software main window shown below
-  If the EVAL-AD7195ASDZ is not connected to the USB port via the controller
   board when the software launches, the AD7195 Eval Board icon does not appear
   in the Attached Hardware section in ACE (see Figure below).To make the AD7195
   Eval Board icon appear, connect the EVAL-AD7195ASDZ and the controller board
   to the USB port of the PC, wait a few seconds, and then follow the
   instructions in the dialog box that opens.

.. image:: images/ad7195attachhardware.png

-  Double click the AD7195 Eval Board icon to open the AD7195 Eval Board view
   window shown below:

.. image:: images/ad7195boardview.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

-  Double click the AD7195 chip icon in the AD7195 Eval Board view window to open the AD7195 chip view window shown below:
-  Click Software Defaults and then click Apply Changes to apply the default
   settings to the AD7195 (see figure below)

Chip view window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After completing the steps in the :doc:`Software Installation Procedures </solutions/reference-designs/ad7195/softwareguide>` section and the :doc:`Evaluation Board Set-up Procedures </solutions/reference-designs/ad7195/hardwareguide>` section, set up the system for data capture by taking the following steps:

-  Block icons that are dark blue are programmable blocks. Click a dark blue block icon to open a configurable pop-up window to customize the data capture.
-  The “Proceed to Memory Map” button brings the user to the memory map of the AD7195. This allows the user to configure the AD7195.
-  The “Proceed to Analysis” button brings the user to the Analysis tab. This
   allows the user to see the performance results of the AD7195 and displays the
   data.

Waveform Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Waveform tab graphs the conversions gathered and processes the data,
calculating the peak-to-peak noise, rms noise, and resolution.

1) Waveform graph and controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data waveform graph shows each successive sample of the ADC output. Zoom in
on the data in the graph using the scroll wheel on your mouse or by selecting
the magnifying glass.

2) Analysis Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Result section shows the analysis of the channel selected

|image1|

3) Samples
~~~~~~~~~~

The Samples numeric control set the number of samples gathered per batch. This
control is unrelated to the ADC mode. You can capture a defined sample set or
continuously gather batches of samples. In both cases, the number of samples set
in the Samples numeric input dictates the number of samples. The Noise Analysis
section displays the results of the noise analysis for the selected analysis
channel, including both noise and resolution measurements.

4) Capture
~~~~~~~~~~

Click the Run Once button to start gathering ADC results. Click the Run
Continuously button to start gathering ADC results continuously. Results appear
in the waveform graph (Label 1).

5) Display Units and Axis Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the Codes drop-down menu to select whether the data graph displays in
units of voltages or codes. This control affects both the waveform graph and the
histogram graph. The axis controls is fixed. When selecting Fixed, the axis
ranges can be programmed; however, these ranges do not automatically adjust
after each batch of samples.

Memory map Window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the Memory Map tab to access the registers of the AD7195, shown in the
figure below. This tab changes register settings and shows additional
information about each bit in each individual register.

1) Export Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Export buttons on the Register Map tab allow the user to save and load
register settings. Click Save to save all the current register settings to a
file for later use. Click Load to load a previously saved register map.

2) Register
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Register section shows the value that is set in the selected register. Check
the value of the register in this window by clicking on the bits. Clicking any
individual bit changes the bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1, depending on the initial
state of the bit. The register value can also be changed by writing the
hexadecimal value in the input field to the right of the individual bits.

3) Bitfields
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bitfields section shows the individual bitfield of the selected register.
The register is broken by name into its bitfields, name of the bitfields, a
description of each bitfield, and access information. Show each individual
bitfield by pressing the show bitfield button (label 3). Apply these changes
using label 4. Search for specific registers using label 5.

4) Register and Bitfield Description and dropdowns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more information of the register and the bitfields in the register, double
click on the register shown by label 2. This will show up the register
description shown by label 6.\
