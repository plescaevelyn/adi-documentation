Activity: DC-DC Boost Converter - ADALM1000
===========================================

Objective:
----------

The object of this activity is to explore an inductor based circuit which can
produce an output voltage which is higher than the supplied voltage. This class
of circuits are referred to as DC to DC converters or boost regulators. In this
activity the voltage from a 1.5 V supply ( battery ) will be boosted to a
voltage high enough to drive two LEDs in series.

Notes:
------

As in all the ALM labs we use the following terminology when referring to the connections to the M1000 connector and configuring the hardware. The green shaded rectangles indicate connections to the M1000 analog I/O connector. The analog I/O channel pins are referred to as CA and CB. When configured to force voltage / measure current –V is added as in CA-V or when configured to force current / measure voltage –I is added as in CA-I. When a channel is configured in the high impedance mode to only measure voltage –H is added as CA-H.

Scope traces are similarly referred to by channel and voltage / current. Such as
CA-V , CB-V for the voltage waveforms and CA-I , CB-I for the current waveforms.

The circuits used in this Lab activity while generally low current can potentially produce voltages beyond the 0 to 5 V analog input range of the ALM1000. :doc:`Input voltage divider techniques </wiki-migration/university/courses/alm1k/circuits1/alm-measure-outside-0-5-range>` as discussed in the document on ALM1000 analog inputs would be required. Refer to the document and construct and use input voltage dividers as necessary when preforming these experiments with the ALM1000.

Background Basics:
------------------

When the current flowing in an inductor is quickly interrupted a large voltage spike is observed across the inductor. This large voltage spike can in fact be useful in some cases. One example is the DC to DC boost converter, which is a circuit that can create a larger DC voltage from a smaller one with very high efficiency. The basic idea is to combine an inductive spike generator with a rectifier circuit, as shown in figure 2. Whenever the transistor is abruptly turned off the voltage at the drain spikes up, the diode D\ :sub:`1` is forward biased and current will flow from the inductor to charge up the storage capacitors C\ :sub:`3` and C\ :sub:`4`. When the drain voltage subsequently drops below the voltage on the capacitor, the diode is reverse biased and the output voltage remains constant. Just as in the chapter on AC power supplies, the output capacitor must be sized appropriately to minimize the ripple relating to the current flowing in the load. We will just use a small capacitor here and hence the circuit will not be able to source a large output current.

This exercise will expand on these concepts, deriving a converter that “boosts”
a low voltage to a high voltage. Subsequent activities will close the loop
around these circuits and examine loop stability and time-domain response.

Activity: Boost and Buck converter elements and open-loop operation
===================================================================

Objective:
----------

The objective of this activity is to explore some of the basic circuit blocks
typically used in buck and boost converters. We'll operate these blocks to the
point where they are "bucking" a high voltage to a low voltage and "boosting" a
low voltage to a high voltage, and examine the open-loop properties of these
modes of operation. We will also discuss the difference between synchronous and
non-synchronous circuits, and continuous conduction mode versus discontinuous
conduction modes. We'll start out by controlling these circuits by directly
controlling the duty cycle of the switches, and then introduce the idea of peak
current control, in which the switch that "charges" the inductor is turned on by
a clock signal, and turned off when the inductor current reaches a certain
level. Subsequent exercises will actively control these circuits in order to
produce an accurate, stable output voltage that is insensitive to changes in
input and output conditions.

Background
----------

The :doc:`Activity: Buck Converter Basics </wiki-migration/university/courses/electronics/buck_converter_basics>` lab activity was a first look into the operation of a very simple (and not very high performance) buck converter. The exercise details the operation of the ideal buck converter shown in Figure 1.

|image1|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 1. Ideal Buck Converter

A simple expression for output voltage as a function of input voltage and the
duty cycle, is then derived:

| :math:`V_OUT = V_IN \times Duty Cycle`
| This is followed by circuit construction, measurements of the open-loop properties of the circuit, and finally, "closing the loop" so that the output voltage remains constant, at the desired voltage, regardless of changes in loading.

This exercise will expand on those concepts, deriving a converter that "boosts"
a low voltage to a high voltage. We will also design a more practical open-loop
buck converter, and introduce a circuit that controls peak inductor current,
rather than duty cycle. Subsequent exercises will close the loop around these
circuits and examine loop stability and time-domain response. An appendix covers
practical aspects of switching converter design such as current sensing, timing
generation, selection of MOSFETs and diodes, and gate drive circuitry.

Activity 1: An Ideal\* Open-Loop Boost Converter Simulation
-----------------------------------------------------------

- (This exercise will use the term "ideal" extensively. A more accurate term
  would be "almost ideal" - LTspice requires finite numbers in certain locations
  - switch on and off resistances can't be zero or infinity, so we're using
  values small enough and large enough to have negligible impact on the
  results.)

Open the OL_Boost_concept_ideal_sw.asc LTSpice file. Notice the differences
between this circuit and the buck converter:

-  One side of the inductor is connected directly to the input supply.
-  The switches are rearranged, with S1 allowing the input supply to be
   connected directly across the inductor, and S2 allowing the inductor to be
   connected or disconnected from the output.

As with the buck basics lab, let's keep two things in mind at all times:

-  Current through an inductor can't change instantaneously
-  The DC voltage across an inductor is zero

The figure below shows the "charge" state of the circuit’s operation, where S1
is closed and S2 is open.

|image2|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 2. Boost Converter Charge

When S1 closes, the left-hand side of the inductor is connected to the 5V
supply, and the right-hand side is connected to ground. This means the voltage
across the inductor is simply the 5V supply. This "charges" the inductor with a
current that ramps up with a positive slope of:

| :math:`di/dt = V_IN/L = 5V/L`
| Note: The polarity of the voltage across the inductor is arbitrary, we're using the convention that a **positive** voltage is one that causes an **increase** in energy stored in the inductor.

The next figure shows the other state, with S1 open and S2 closed.

|image3|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 3. Boost Converter Discharge

| When S2 closes, the left-hand side of inductor L1 is still connected to Vin, while the right-hand side is now connected to Vout. The current through L1 is now flowing to the output, and decreasing with a negative slope of: :math:`\displaystyle di/dt = \frac{V_IN-V_OUT}{L} = \frac{5V-V_OUT}{L}`
| Similar to the buck converter basics activity 1 the “freq” and “duty” parameters set the frequency of the switching to 25kHz and the duty cycle of the voltages imposed on this switch node (sw_node) to 50%. That is, the righthand side of the inductor spends half of the time connected to ground (charging phase), and half of the time connected to the output (discharging phase). Run the simulation, and probe sw_node, Vout, and the current through inductor L1. Zoom in toward the end of the run after the startup transient damps out (after 8ms). (You can right-click, Auto range y-axis to line up the two waveforms.)

|image4|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 4. Boost Converter Switch Node, inductor current, and Output

Observe the peak and valley of the waveform I(L1) (green waveform), noting the
current ripple. Using the cursors from peak to peak, we can observe that the
inductor is charging and discharging linearly (with the period of 1/25kHz, or
40us, with a duty cycle of 50% making ts1 and ts2 20us each).

The output voltage is almost exactly 10V - double the input voltage - with a
small ripple imposed. Verify that the previously solved equations are true,
using the cursors to measure the inductor current waveforms.

| For the "charge" phase: :math:`di/dt=5V/100 \mu H`
| And for the "discharge" phase: :math:`\displaystyle di/dt=\frac{5V-10V}{100} \mu H`
| Revisiting the concept of zero DC across an inductor, how can we find the output voltage of a boost converter knowing the input voltage, frequency, and duty cycle? “Zero DC across an inductor” means that over a long period of time, the average volt-second product is zero. Thus:

| :math:`(V_IN-0) \times ts1+(V_IN-V_OUT) \times ts2=0`
| Where tS1 is the time that S1 is closed, tS2 is the time that S2 is closed. Rearranging, we see that: :math:`\displaystyle V_OUT=V _IN \times \frac{ts1+ts2}{ts2}`
| Note that :math:`ts1/(ts1+ts2)`
| is the duty cycle of the switch node, we can rewrite the expression for V\ :sub:`OUT` as a function of duty cycle: :math:`V_OUT=V_IN \times 1/(1-Duty Cycle)`
| Since our duty cycle is based off ts1 and ts2, and the duty cycle is always between 0% and 100%, the above equation demonstrates that the average output voltage is always equal or larger than the input voltage, a basic property of a boost converter, and at a 50% duty cycle, the output voltage is double the input voltage.

Now change the duty cycle in the simulation and re-run. The following are
screenshots show the output voltage at 20% duty cycle(expected output of 6.25V)
and 80% duty cycle(expected output of 25V).

Can you boost to an arbitrarily high voltage? See Appendix: "Extreme Boosting"
to find out.

Load Regulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far we've operated the boost circuit unloaded. In this condition, the duty
cycle to boost factor relationships held true, but what happens if you start to
draw current from the output (as you would in a practical circuit - after all, a
power supply exists to power stuff!) Furthermore, consider the boost converter's
output switch (S2). If we look at the current waveform and the voltage waveform
of the unloaded circuit, we see that for part of the cycle, the inductor current
goes negative, and when this occurs, the output voltage is ramping DOWN! This
seems counterproductive for a boost converter, doesn't it? This mode of
operation has a name - "Forced Continuous Conduction Mode". It is forced because
the switches always impose a voltage across the inductor, so its current is
always either ramping up or down.

Next, connect the 25 ohm load resistor to the output node (drawing an average
current of 0.4 amps from the 10V output). Note that the impact on the output
voltage is minimal, and the inductor current is still ramping up and down with
the same peak-to-peak ripple, however the current is now always positive
(flowing from input to output, according to our convention.)

But are we still FORCING this circuit to conduct continuously? We'll find out
shortly...

Activity 2: A real Open-Loop Boost Converter
--------------------------------------------

Open OL_Boost_concept_actual.asc in LTspice (see Figure 8). This simulation is a
close approximation of the ADALM-SR1 configured for this mode.

|image8|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 8. Open-Loop Boost LTspice Schematic

Note that the simulation includes some of the non-ideal aspects of the
real-world circuit:

-  Replace the ideal diode with a real diode, a MBRS340 (which is a close variant of the MBRA340 on the SR1)
-  Add the series resistance of three windings of the Wurth '141 inductor.
-  Replace the switch with an IRF7468 (close to the IRF7470 on the SR1)
-  Add the 0.1Ω current sense resistors
-  Add output capacitors, with ESR

| Note that this schematic still contains many simplifications - the gate driver is not shown, nor are the current sense amplifiers. And since the circuit is powered from an ideal voltage source (zero impedance), input capacitors can be eliminated. This will be a recurring theme, deciding what to simulate and what to assume is close enough to ideal that it can be eliminated from the simulation in the interest of speed, or in some cases, converging at all. The most obvious substitution is the replacement of the top switch with a diode. This will be discussed in more detail shortly, but for now, note that a diode is in fact a switch that conducts when the voltage at the anode is higher than the voltage at the cathode, and does not conduct when the polarity of the voltages are reversed.

| Connect a 5V, 1A USB power supply to the Auxiliary Power micro USB jack. At this point, the frequency and duty cycle can be fine-tuned by looking at the D0 signal in Scopy's logic analyzer. Set the frequency to 20kHz (50μs period) and duty cycle to 25% (high time of 12.5μs)

.. note::

   Add Logic Analyzer Plot

Ramp the Power Input to 5V and observe the current sense and switch node
waveforms. Note that Scopy's vertical scale can be entered arbitrarily - enter a
value of 350mV/Div, which corresponds to 500mA/Div. Figures 10 and 11 show
simulated vs. measured results, respectively, at 25% duty cycle. Note that the
output voltages match quite well, both are very close to 6V. This is less than
the predicted 6.66V of an ideal boost converter, however, note that this circuit
starts off with about a 0.4V drop due to to the output diode. Output current is
about 240mA (6V/25Ω), which will cause another 275mV drop due to the two 0.1Ω
sense resistors and the 0.95Ω resistance of the inductor. This is a total drop
of about 0.676V, almost exactly the difference between the ideal case and
reality!

Going Further
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try experimenting with the various load resistors and duty cycle potentiometer.
The ADALM-SR1 does have a level of protection from stressful operating
conditions: load and inductor overheating, output overvoltage, etc., but in this
configuration please observe the following precautions:

-  Keep duty cycle under 50%
-  Keep the input voltage at or below 5V
-  Leave the frequency at 20kHz

Activity 3: Synchronous vs. Non-Synchronous Circuits
----------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   Describe in more detail why we replaced the top switch with a diode,
   simulation with an ideal diode, and show that it's equivalent to the
   synchronous circuit when operating in CCM.

Activity 4: Discontinuous Conduction Mode
-----------------------------------------

With the circuit still configured as in Activity 2, reduce, or "lighten", the output load by **removing** the 50Ω and 100Ω load resistor jumpers, leaving the two 200Ω jumpers in place for a total load resistance of 100Ω. You should notice the switch node and inductor current take on a drastically different shape. Figure X shows the switch node and inductor current at a 25% duty cycle. The output voltage jumps to 7.74V, HIGHER than the 6.67V predicted by the output voltage equation above (even with the drop of the boost diode and the IxR drop of the sense resistors and inductors.)

|image14|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure x. DCM, 20kHz, 50% Duty Cycle, 100Ω Load

Figure X shows the switch node and inductor current at a 50% duty cycle. The
output voltage is measured at 11.6V, again, higher than predicted.

|image15|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure x. DCM, 20kHz, 50% Duty Cycle, 100Ω Load

This is a second mode of operation called "Discontinuous Conduction Mode", and
clearly it needs some additional equations to describe the relationship between
input voltage, duty cycle, and now, output loading...

Activity 5: An Open-Loop Buck Converter
---------------------------------------

(Simulation and ADALM-SR1, no need to separate, buck basics lab handles the
ideal case.)

Activity 6: Peak Current Control
--------------------------------

Controlling a switch's duty cycle in order to adjust the output voltage of a
switching regulator seems like a straightforward method, and we'll set up the
circuit to automatically adjust the duty cycle to maintain a constant output
voltage in the next exercises. But it turns out that there are advantages to not
directly controlling the duty cycle, but rather, to control the maximum, or
peak, inductor current at each and every clock cycle. This mode of operation
("current mode") has dynamic advantages in closed-loop operation that will be
explained in the next exercise. But since this exercise is focusing on open-loop
operation, we'll just describe and demonstrate the circuits operation, and point
out one very important advantage of peak current control - the overall circuit
is inherently short-circuit proof!

Open OL_boost_peak_current_control.asc, shown in Figure X.

|image16|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure X. Peak Current Control Circuit, Boost Mode

The implemenation of the ADALM-SR1 peak current control circuit differs from
that of a typical boost converter, such as the LT1930 shown in Figure X, however
the end result is similar.

|image17|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure X. LT1930 Boost Converter Block Diagram

| In both circuits, a master oscillator sets the operating frequency. The rising edge of the clock is shaped into a narrow "set" pulse (or "sliver"). A narrow pulse is necessary as it sets the "minimum on-time" of the switch, and hence, the minimum boost factor. So in theory, the output of an unloaded asynchronous boost converter would rise without bound! In practice, there is always some limiting factor, shuch as the feedback resistance, parasitic capacitances, or other losses that limti the upper bound. Furthermore, converters designed to operate at very light loads will incorporate additional methods - such as blanking the clock entirely.
| Assume that both the LT1930 and ADALM-SR1 start out with zero inductor current (right after applicaiton of power), and the current control signal (usually called ITH) is nonzero. Also assume the LT1930's R-S flip-flop is reset, and the ADALM-SR1's LT1671 comparator's Q output is low, Q# is high, such that the LT1671 is latched OFF, even though its IN+ input (ITH) is higher than its IN- input (Ihigh current sense signal).
| When the set pulse occurs, the LT1930's R-S flip flop is... set, the output switch is turned on, and inductor current starts to ramp up. Similarly, the ADALM-SR1's set pulse momentarily pulls the LT1671's LE pin low, unlatching the comaprator, which in turn turns on the switch (M1), and inductor current starts to ramp up.
| Both the LT1930 and ADALM-SR1 current signals also begin to ramp up as inductor current increases. When the current sense signal reaches the same voltage as ITH, the comparators trip, shutting off the respective switches, and the process begins again at the next set pulse.
| That is quite a lot of text to describe a rather strange (for those who've never seen it before), so the best thing to do is start out running the LTspice simulation, which is configured to modulate ITH with a 2kHz sinusoid. Results are shown in Figure X. Note that we can "trick" LTspice into displaying the ITH and Ihigh signals as the current they represent by adding some arithmetic to the traces - right-click the label (V(ith), for example), then add " \*(1A/0.7V) ", which is the gain of the current sense circuit.

Next, configure the ADALM-SR1 for open-loop boost, peak current control as shown
in Figure X.

|image19|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure X. ADALM-SR1 configuration for Open-Loop Buck, Peak Current Control

There is indeed provision on the ADALM-SR1 to modulate the ITH signal exactly as
shown in the simulation, and that technique will be used in a future exercise to
characterize the frequency response of the circuit. In this exercise, we'll just
focus on steady-state behavior. Set the clock frequency to 20kHz, duty cycle to
50% (midscale, can be approximate). Set channel 2 vertical scale to
340mV/division, corresponiding to 500mA per division. Set the current threshold
potentiometer such that the current peaks are at about to about 1.5 divisions
(750mA). In this configuration, vary the input voltage from 5V to 10V, and vary
the output load from 50Ω to 100Ω. These conditions are shown in Figure X. Note
the changes in rising slope (which will be steeper with higher input voltage),
falling slope (which will be shallower when the output voltage is higher), and
that the circuit transitions between continuous and discontinuous modes. But in
all cases, the peak current stays fixed.

Conclusion
----------

This lab exercise detailed the "power path" for non-synchronous boost and buck
converters, illustrating duty-cycle control and peak current control. These
circuits would be practical by themselves in a well-controlled environment,
where input voltage and output loading conditions are well-known and stable. But
real-world applications rarely fall into this category, so it is necessary to
add a means of sensing the output voltage and adjusting the operating parameters
(duty cycle or peak current) to maintain regulation as conditions change. This
will be covered in the next exercises.

Appendix: Extreme Boosting
--------------------------

.. note::

   Simulations at 99% duty cycle, and why high boost factors are almost never
   practical in real life.

Appendix: Current Sense Techniques
----------------------------------

| There are several methods of measuring current in a circuit. Like any electrical measurement, the act of measuring the current will have some effect on the circuit's operation. One of the least obtrusive when a convenient measuring point is physically accessible is a current probe. A wideband current probe that sensitive to DC (a steady-state current) uses a combination of a current transformer that is sensitive at high frequencies and a Hall-effect sensor that is sensitive to DC. Fine tuning the frequency responses of these curcuits such that the combined response is "flat" over all frequencies is a delicate task, and is one reason current probes tend to be very expensive. Also, current probes require that the curent flow through the probe's head, so an extra wire may need to be introduced into the circuit. If the added inductance of the extra wire is significant compared to other inductances in the cirucit, then circuit operation may be significantly impacted. Figure X shows a current probe being used to measure the ADALM-SR1 inductor current. The inductance selection jumper is replaced with a short jumper wire that is looped through the current probe twice to double the sensitivity (twice the current effectively flows through the probe.)
| |image21|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure x. Probing ADALM-SR1 Inductor Current W/ Tektronix P6042 Probe

But of course chip manufacturers can't ship a current probe with every device,
so other smaller, lower cost, and lower (but adequate) performance methods must
be used. Some of these include:

- Sensing the voltage across an external sense resistor, with an amplifier that is optimized for the common-mode voltage range (accurate, but lossy) \* Sensing the voltage across the R\ :sub:`DS`\ (on) of the switching MOSFET (not accurate, but not lossy) \* Sensing the voltage across the inductor's ESR (not accurate, not lossy, but requires filtering)

While some of these methods are not very accurate in absolute terms, this is
typically not a concern as the current measurement (and current control) is
enclosed in an outer voltage control loop that IS accurate. Also, these methods
do not always measure the entire current waveform; depending on the sense
amplifier topology and position within the circuit, they may only "catch" the
rising slope of the current waveform, and they may not be able to sense reverse
currents (even if they are small, as during the "ringing" portion of a
discontinuous switch node waveform". This is fine if that is what is important
(as it is in an actual switchign regulator), but for a complete analysis, a
complete picture of both rising and falling waveforms, including negative
currents.

The ADALM-SR1 includes two sense resistors and two LT1995, 30MHz difference
amplifiers in a differential gain of 7. This provides a simple, high-bandiwdth,
DC-coupled picture of inductor current. While either amplifier could be used for
either boost or buck operation, the "high side" amplifier is used for boost
topology, and the "low side" amplifier is used for the buck topology. In both of
these cases, the amplifier is at the "non-switching" side of the inductor such
that its common-mode voltage is costant, and the complete inductor waveform is
visible.

   LT1995 simple situations

Appendix: Gate Divers
---------------------

The MOSFETs in the LTspice simulations in this exercise are all either directly
driven from a pulse voltage source, or by a VCVS (voltage-controlled voltage
source) that "level shifts" a ground-referred signal. But what is used in the
actual ADALM-SR1 circuit, and why aren't we using its LTspice model?

| Driving the gate of the low-side (boost) MOSFET seems like such a simple job - Ground the gate, and the MOSFET is off. If you measure the resistance from the gate to ground, the resistance is so high that it is likely that your meter will overrange (assuming the board is clean from flux or other contamination.) And the low threshold voltage of the IRF7470 makes it compatible with 5V logic-level signals. But there are subtleties to driving a MOSFET: Even the boost MOSFET can be tricky to drive - as the MOSFET is turning on, the gate-drain capacitance will draw significant current. And if for some reason the gate drive voltage is too low, due to a collapsing housekeeping supply for example, the MOSFET may not be driven fully on, resulting in excessive power dissipation. The high side (buck) MOSFET is much trickier - the ground-referred gate control signal needs to be "level-shifted" and referred to the MOSFET's source, which toggles back and forth between about -0.4V and the input voltage - quite a challenge. For these reasons, LTC7001s were used. The LTC7001 is specifically designed to drive N-channel MOSFETS, addressing all of these issues.
| Figure X shows LTspice simulations of both the LTC7001 gate driver, as well as its VCVS "equivalent".
| |image22|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure X. LTC7001 vs. VCVS Gate Drivers

.. tip::

   An important aspect of the LTC7001 is that it has an internal charge pump
   that will keep the BST capacitor charged even if the cirucit isn't switching.
   This allows the ADALM-SR1 to function at arbitrarily low frequencies, even
   zero. In fact, the top MOSFET, which is the switching element in buck
   configurations, is held continuously ON when the board is configured as a
   boost converter. Other gate drivers may REQUIRE that the source pin be
   periodically driven to ground, as would occur in normal buck converter
   operation.

With that in mind, run the OL_gate_drivers.asc simulation, the results of which
are shown in Figure X.

|image23|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure X. LTC7001 vs. VCVS Gate Drivers

Note that in both cases, the gate drive signal is a nice, "strong" or "sharp"
square wave imposed between the MOSFET's source and gate.

Appendix: Timing Generation
---------------------------

Timing on the Switching Regulator Active Learning Module is generated by an
LTC6992-3 pulse-width modulator and variable frequency oscillator. The frequency
range is XX to YY, and the PWM duty cycle of the -3 variant extends from zero to
95%, never reaching 100%. This is a great device for generating timing signals
for this board because it can be used both as pulse-width modulator and a clock.
As a PWM generator, a simple 0-1V control signal to set the duty-cycle to 0-100%
(clipped at 95% for the -3). To use the devices as a clock generator, simply set
the duty cycle to 50% by setting the MOD pin to 0.5V.

The -3 variant is used for two reasons: First, it limits the maximum boost
factor, providing some redundancy to the overvoltage shutdown circuits. Second,
the peak-current control circuit is still active in direct-duty-cycle control
mode. This circuit requires clock edges in order to reset, and limiting the duty
cycle to 95% ensures that edges occur. (A duty cycle of 100% is a signal that is
always high, so there are no edges to reset the current limit.)

Another point about the LTC6992 - the "classic" method of generating a PWM
signal is to compare a sawtooth or triangular reference ramp to the modulation
signal as shown in the circuit below:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/labs/open_loop_boost_and_buck_adalm2000/classic_pwm_generation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 800

Where V2 is the modulation signal. The upper trace shows the PWM output; note
that the duty cycle is high when the modulation signal is high, and vice-versa.
The LTC6992 is functionally very similar, with the exception that the response
is not immediate - the modulation bandwidth is approximately 10kHz, roughly
equivalent to placing a 10kHz, 1-pole filter at the output of V2 in the figure
above. As long as the loop bandwidth of the switching regulator is significantly
lower than 10kHz (a safe assumption in most of our use cases), the impact is
minimal.

Appendix: "Engineer Proofing"
-----------------------------

Given the fact that bad things sometimes happen to good people, and even the
best engineers make mistakes, The ADALM-SR1 includes numerous protection
features:

- Input Overvoltage (to +40V) \* Input Undervoltage (between 0V and 3.3V) \*
  Input Reverse Voltage (to -40V) \* Inductor overheating (above 50C) \* Load
  resistor overheating (above 50C) \* Output Overvoltage (above 22V)

These are described in comments in the OL_engineer_proofing.asc schematic.
Students are strongly encouraged to open and run this simulation, as it
represents some "real world" design decisions that were wrapped around an
otherwise "purely instructional" circuit.

Simple inductor and switch DC/DC Converter:
-------------------------------------------

Directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~

First step is to build a 1.5V power supply ( to simulate a single cell battery )
as shown in figure 1. Build the circuit on one end of your solder-less
breadboard being sure to leave space for the rest of this lab’s circuits. Note,
if you have a 1.5 Volt battery (AA) and a battery holder with wires attached,
you could substitute that as the 1.5 V supply.

   :width: 550

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 1, 1.5 Volt power supply

Once you have the 1.5 V supply constructed, you will need to adjust the potentiometer, R\ :sub:`1`, such that the output is set to 1.5 V. Use one or the other of the ALM1000 inputs in Hi-Z mode to measure the voltage. ( display the AVG voltage for the channel you choose ). An optional DMM could also be used to measure the DC voltage. Note the dashed green box in figure 1 surrounding the ground connections. Later you will be measuring the current in ground for different sections of the circuit. The ground connections in figure 1 will always be connected directly to the ground of the ALM1000. The other sections of ground will, at various times, be either connected to the main ground or the CH-B connector pin on the ALM1000. So as you construct the circuit keep these "ground" connections separate, i.e. don’t use one of the common power bus strips for all the "grounds".

Temporarily connect one of your LEDs from the 1.5 V output to ground. Be careful
to note the polarity of the diode so it will be forward biased. Does it light
up? Probably not since 1.5 V is generally not enough to turn on an LED. We need
a way to boost the 1.5 V to a higher voltage to light a single LED let alone two
LEDs connected in series. Disconnect the 2.5 V supply and remove the LED before
moving to the next construction step.

Next, on your solderless breadboard construct the DC-DC boost circuit section as
shown in figure 2.

The 6 winding HPH1-1400L inductor can be configured for 6 different inductance values depending on how many windings are connected in series. Connecting all 6 windings in series will give 36 times ( N\ :sup:`2` ) the inductance of a single winding ( 0.2 mH ) or about 7 mH. 5 windings = 25 X 0.2 or about 5 mH, 4 windings = 16 X 0.2 or about 3.6mH. Any or all of these configurations should work for L\ :sub:`1`.

You can use a 1N4001 or a 1N3064 for the rectifier diode D\ :sub:`1` and the snubber diode D\ :sub:`2`. Be sure to connect the left end of L\ :sub:`1` to the 1.5V supply from the section in figure 1. The gate of the NMOS switch transistor M\ :sub:`1` is connected to the CH-A output of the ALM1000.

The ground connections in figure 2 shown in the dashed green boxes will
sometimes be connected directly to the ground of the ALM1000. At other times,
they will either be connected to the main ground or the CH-B connector pin on
the ALM1000 depending which branch current is being measured. So as you
construct the circuit keep the "ground #2" connections separate from the "ground
#3" connections (and the "ground #1" connections from figure 1), i.e. don’t use
one of the common power bus strips for all the "grounds".

   Figure 2, DC to DC boost converter section

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

Start with the three sections of ground ( #1 and #2 and #3 ) all connected to
the main ALM1000 ground. With CH-B in Hi-Z mode you will be using it to observe
various voltage waveforms around the circuit.

Start with a switching frequency of 2 kHz which is supplied by AWG A, CA-V. Set the Min value to 0 and the Max value to 3.5 ( enough to turn on M\ :sub:`1` ). Set the mode to SVMI and the shape to square.

Using CH-B in Hi-Z mode observe and save the voltage waveforms seen at the following circuit nodes. First, the 1.5 V input source. Second, the drain of M\ :sub:`1`. Third the "boosted" output, V\ :sub:`OUT`\ at the top of LED\ :sub:`1`. You should also measure the current in the LEDs by taking the voltage at the junction of R\ :sub:`3` and LED\ :sub:`2` divided by the value of R\ :sub:`3`, 100 Ω.

What is the average DC voltage of the "boosted" output? What is the p-p ripple
seen on the waveform? What is the average DC current in the LEDs and what is the
p-p ripple seen in the current? Record the values in your lab report.

You may want to save snap-shots of the voltage traces or save the VBuffB array
to another temporary data array to be plotted later when you are making the
current measurements.

Measuring Currents:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have measured all the interesting voltage waveforms associated with
the circuit we need to measure the relevant current waveforms as well.

If we set the channel B voltage to a DC value we can think of it as an AC ( and
DC ) ammeter with one end connected to the set DC voltage. The DC voltage we set
could be a supply voltage or it could be 0V and we would then be measuring the
current flowing into or out of ground.

The first current we will measure is the current in the inductor L\ :sub:`1`. Be sure the frequency of the clock CH-A is still set to 2 KHz. Set AWG CH-B to SVMI mode and Shape to DC with a Max value of 1.5 V, to match the 1.5 V from the 1.5 V supply from figure 1 ( or AA battery if you are using that ). Because the shape is set to DC the Min and frequency values are ignored. Disconnect the left end of L\ :sub:`1` from the 1.5V supply and connect L\ :sub:`1` to CH-B. Under the curves menu be sure to select the CB-I trace to be displayed.

Hit the run button and you should see the square wave ( switch drive ) on the
CA-V trace, the constant 1.5V DC voltage on the CB-V trace and the inductor
current on the CB-I trace. Adjust the CB-I vertical scale as needed to fit the
peak amplitude of the current on the screen.

Note the time when switch M\ :sub:`1` is on and when M\ :sub:`1` is off and the current in L\ :sub:`1`. Take a snap-shot of the CB-I current trace for future reference ( or save the IBuffB array into another array so it can be plotted later).

Disconnect L\ :sub:`1` from CH-B and reconnect it to the 1.5V supply.

Now we want to measure the currents in the two sections of "ground" you separated out when you built the breadboard. First, disconnect the ground #2 section from the main ground bus and connect it to CH-B. Set CH-B Max value to 0 ( the same voltage as ground ). The current in ground #2 is just the current in M\ :sub:`1`, the switch.

Hit the run button and you should see the square wave ( switch drive ) on the CA-V trace, the constant 0V DC voltage on the CB-V trace and the M\ :sub:`1` source current on the CB-I trace. Adjust the CB-I vertical scale as needed to fit the peak amplitude of the current on the screen. Note the polarity ( direction ) of the current. Display the saved L\ :sub:`1` current trace and compare the two. What part of the L\ :sub:`1` current flows in M\ :sub:`1` and where in time does it flow? Save the CB-I trace of ground section #2. (save the IBuffB array into another array ).

Now we will measure the current in the LED load, including the by-pass filter capacitors C\ :sub:`3` and C\ :sub:`4`. Disconnect the ground #2 section from CH-B and reconnect it to the main ground bus. Disconnect the ground #3 section from the main ground bus and connect it to CH-B. The current in ground #3 combines the LED current and the current in the capacitors C\ :sub:`3` and C\ :sub:`4` which is also the current in diode D\ :sub:`1`.

Hit the run button and you should see the square wave ( switch drive ) on the CA-V trace, the constant 0V DC voltage on the CB-V trace and the LED load current on the CB-I trace. Adjust the CB-I vertical scale as needed to fit the peak amplitude of the current on the screen. Note the polarity ( direction ) of the current. Display the saved L\ :sub:`1` current trace and compare the two. What part of the L\ :sub:`1` current flows in load and where in time does it flow? Save the CB-I trace of ground section #3. (save the IBuffB array into another array ).

Conservation of current says that the sum of the current in M\ :sub:`1` and D\ :sub:`1` should be the same as the current in L\ :sub:`1`. Use the Math plotting function to plot the sum of the saved ground #2 and ground #3 data buffers. Compare this to the measured L\ :sub:`1` current waveform.

As additional investigation.

Now increase the frequency to 4, 6 and 8 KHz. Measure and record the boosted
output voltage waveform and the current waveforms. Explain what has changed and
why?

With a 2 KHz clock frequency, reduce the duty-cycle of the CH-A square wave
switch drive waveform from 50% to 45%, 35% and 25%. How does the duty cycle
change the voltage and current waveforms?

Appendix:
---------

Improved 1.5V sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The output impedance ( load regulation ) of the simple emitter follower in figure 1 can be improved through the addition of feedback. Shown in figure A1 is a follower circuit where the single NPN ( Q\ :sub:`1` is a 2N3904) transistor is replaced with a NPN/PNP compound transistor ( Q\ :sub:`2` is a 2N3906 ). The load regulation of a single transistor follower is a function of how much the V\ :sub:`BE` changes as the emitter current changes. In the case of the compound transistor configuration a small increase in the current of Q\ :sub:`1` is amplified and causes a much larger current to flow in PNP transistor Q\ :sub:`2`.

There is also the added benefit that the base current of Q\ :sub:`1` is now much smaller and its effect on the voltage divider of R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` is much smaller.

   Figure A1, Improved follower

Even better load regulation can be achieved by using an op-amp to provide high gain. As shown in figure A2, the output of the op-amp drives the base of transistor Q\ :sub:`1` to whatever bias voltage is need to maintain the emitter voltage ( negative input of the op-amp ) equal to the voltage set at the positive input of the op-amp by the voltage divider. The circuit can essentially source current up to the maximum current limit of the transistor or the +5V power supply with very little change in the +1.5V output.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Software Requirements**

To measure this circuit with the ADALM1000 module you will need to use the Equivalent Time Sampling functionality within the ALICE 1.3 user interface. One of the advanced features that can be enabled in ALICE is Equivalent Time Sampling which, for certain classes of periodic waveforms, can increase the apparent sampling to MSPS rates. How to use ETS is outlined in the :doc:`ALICE Equivalent Time Sampling User’s Guide </wiki-migration/university/tools/m1k/alice/advanced-equivalent-time-sampling-guide>`

An assembled PC board version of the buck converter circuit is available as the
ADALM-BUCK-ARDZ experiment board.

While there are a number of connections required to construct this test circuit,
it can be assembled on a solderless breadboard as in figure A1.13. Note that the
HPH1-1400L has six inductors that can be connected in any way (series, parallel,
or a combination of the two). Be sure to observe proper polarity, connecting all
inductors in series as shown.

Measure the ripple current for different numbers of series-connected inductors.
The figure below shows the ripple current for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 inductors. How
well does this match the LTspice simulation?

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure A1.15. Ripple Current for 2 to 6 Windings in Series

*(Notice the "steps" in the switch node voltage as the inductor current passes
through zero. After switching, current initially flows through diodes D1 or D2.
As the current passes through zero and switches direction, the LT1054 output
driver "takes over" and drives the switch node. In the LTspice simulation, try
probing the LT1054 CAP+ current, D1 current, and D2 current separately, noting
that the inductor current is the sum of the three.)*

Measure the ripple voltage at the output of the converter, with a 22uF output
capacitor. Then place an additional 47uF capacitor in parallel, for a total of
69uF. Does the measured ripple match the simulated ripple reasonably well? Note
that both the inductor and electrolytic capacitors can have a very wide
tolerance - tolerances of +/-20% are common for inductors, and -20%/+80% is a
common tolerance for electrolytic capacitors. The animated figure below shows
the ripple voltage for output capacitances of 22uF and 22uF+47uF.

connections to an Arduino Uno clone. The yellow wire connects the buck output to
the Arduino's A0 input, and the blue wire connects the Arduino's PWM output on

The following figure shows the operation of the closed-loop circuit. The set
point voltage is 3.141V, and the purple trace starts out close to this value at
the left hand side of the screen shot. A 50 ohm load is then connected to the
output, drawing approximately 120mA, and producing a dip in the output voltage.
The Arduino loop detects this and increases the PWM frequency accordingly,
restoring the voltage to its correct value. Then the resistor is removed,
producing an increase in the output voltage. Once again, the Arduino loop
detects this disturbance and compensates.
