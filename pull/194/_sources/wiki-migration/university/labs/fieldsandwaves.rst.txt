Electromagnetic Fields and Waves Lab
------------------------------------

The purpose of this lab class is to give the student a practical sense of what
electromagnetics is. This very fundamental area has been an essential part of
electrical engineering since it became a separate discipline in the overall
Engineering profession in the late 1800s.

For nearly all of these lab activities, you will be connecting a signal source
to the input of some circuit or network and observing both the input and output
voltage waveforms. Be sure that you always observe both Vin and Vout on the
oscilloscope channels. If you only observe what is happening at the output of
the circuit, you will have learned little or nothing about how the circuit
operates.

Circuit Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic information and material on :doc:`circuit simulation </wiki-migration/university/courses/electronics/circuitsimulationnotes>`, including tool links and usage information.

Many of the labs are populated with :adi:`LTspice <en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html>` resource files which contain the schematics of the circuits discussed at a specific topic.

Lab Hardware and Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These labs can be performed using the :doc:`ADALM1000 </wiki-migration/university/tools/m1k>` (M1K) entry level Active Learning Module or the :doc:`ADALM2000 </wiki-migration/university/tools/m2k>` (M2K) more advanced level Active Learning Module. :doc:`This document </wiki-migration/university/courses/alm1k/m2k-convert-labs>` outlines how labs might be altered for use with either M1K or M2K.

General background Information.
-------------------------------

The assumption is made that the reader has some familiarity with either the
ADALM1000 Lab hardware and ALICE software system or the ADALM2000 Lab hardware
and Scopy software system, before starting these lab activities depending on
which set of labs are to be preformed.

Things to think about
---------------------

Learning to mathematically analyze circuits requires much study and practice.
Typically, students practice by working through lots of sample problems and
checking their answers against those provided by the textbook or the instructor.
While this is good, there is a much better way. You will learn much more by
actually building and analyzing real circuits, letting your test equipment
provide the "answers" instead of a book or another person. For successful
circuit-building exercises, follow these steps:

1. Carefully measure and record all component values prior to circuit
   construction, choosing resistor values high enough to make damage to any
   active components unlikely.

2. Draw the schematic diagram for the circuit to be analyzed. Or perhaps print
   out the schematics shown in these lab activities.

3. Carefully build this circuit on your breadboard.

4. Before applying power to your circuit check the accuracy of the circuit's
   construction, following each wire to each connection point, and verifying
   these elements one-by-one on the diagram.

5. Mathematically analyze the circuit, solving for all voltage and current
   values. Circuit simulation software such as LTSpice can be very useful for
   automating this process.

6. Carefully measure all voltages and currents, to verify the accuracy of your
   analysis.

7. If there are any substantial errors (greater than a few percent), carefully
   check your circuit's construction against the diagram, then carefully
   re-calculate the values and re-measure.

One way you can save time and reduce the possibility of error is to begin with a
very simple circuit and incrementally add components to increase its complexity
after each analysis, rather than building a whole new circuit for each practice
activity. Another time-saving technique is to re-use the same components in a
variety of different circuit configurations. This way, you won't have to measure
any component's value more than once.

The Good Lab Report
===================

When performing lab tests, whether in college or industry, the lab report is
vital for communicating the results in a logically ordered, readable fashion to
others. To ensure readability, the report should be done using a word processor
that can do text formatting, as well as math equation editing and drawing simple
diagrams and schematics. A spell checker is useful to avoid spelling mistakes.
All sections of the lab should be organized in some logical fashion, for example
in the order the steps were performed. Material in later sections should
reference any related material in previous sections.

The following section describes the layout that should be used.

In order to write a successful lab report it should contain the following key
elements: objectives, pre lab calculations, equipment used, methods, results
discussion, and end with conclusions.

Objectives
----------

The objectives section should be a brief one paragraph summary of the objectives
of the lab experiments. In other words, this section should contain a short list
of the steps to be performed as well as the expected test results.

Pre lab
-------

Any preparation that was done prior to the lab should be presented here. This
section should contain a short list of tests to be performed as well as the
expected results. Expected pre-lab calculations or other work such as circuit
simulations is often set out in the Lab worksheet.

Equipment and Materials
-----------------------

This section includes a list of equipment, hardware and material used to perform
the experiments. This list should include the make and model of any equipment
used and a complete list of parts. Expected components, hardware and equipment
to be used is often set out in the Lab worksheet.

Methods
-------

The Methods section should include detailed descriptions of each of the
experiments to be performed. This should include both a description of the
circuit and the test setup used to acquire the measured data. The measured data
should not be included in this section, but rather in the results section. When
describing the circuits and test setups, all relevant descriptions should be
illustrated with diagrams and/or schematics. Enough information should be
provided so that the reader can repeat the experiment completely.

Results and Discussion
----------------------

All of the test results should be included here. The results from each
experiment should be presented in the same order as it was in the above methods
section. The data or each experiment should be presented in a logical, concise
format such as a graph or a table. Graphs should be completely labeled and all
the axis should be scaled correctly. Sketches should be to scale with all
pertinent points measured and marked correctly. Spreadsheet programs are a good
way to generate graphs of your data. Much of the tests are performed using
computer software tools. These tools often provide a means to save data or
screen images to a file for inclusion in your lab report. Finally, the data
should be discussed. Any apparent errors or unexpected results should be
discussed.

Conclusions
-----------

At the end sum up your results and lessons learned from problems and mistakes
made along the way. A few comments on next steps or further work to examine the
subject matter in more depth is also a good practice.

Measurement Errors
------------------

There is no such thing as a perfect or ideal measurement which provides the
"true value" of the measured quantity. There are a number of reasons for this,
from limitations of the measurement equipment used and those of the observer, to
the variations in the components in the circuit for which the measurement is
made. This does not mean that good, useful measurements are not possible.
Obtaining them requires not only adequate instruments but also some attention
and vigilance against common mistakes which seem to lurk in even the best of
laboratory setups. Gross mistakes are such errors as connecting a voltmeter lead
to a wrong point in a circuit or entering data incorrectly into a notebook or a
computer. These can be avoided by following proper procedures, careful data
recording etc. Here we are concerned with two other important concepts: accuracy
and precision.

Accuracy can be defined as the difference between the value obtained from
measurement and a real "true" value of a quantity. It can be expressed in
absolute numbers, such as 10 mV, or in relative numbers, such as 0.5%. In the
first case the measured voltage may be different from the actual voltage by no
more than 10 mV, in the second by the given percentage. Accuracy is difficult to
determine, because we never know what the real value of the measured quantity
is, but it can be roughly estimated if we know the precision of instrument and
the reliability of it's calibration.

Precision of a measurement is related to the smallest difference between the
measured values that can be distinguished. For example, if a voltmeter precision
is 0.1 V we could measure the difference between 10.2 V and 10.3 V but no
better. A reading of 10.25 may be assigned to either of these values, we could
not tell. Precision is often confused with the resolution of the instrument
scale. Just because an instrument has a finely divided scale on which we can
read numbers "precisely" (true for many digital instruments), it does not
necessarily follow that the measurement is precise. It may happen that when you
disconnect the meter and connect it again to the same source you get a different
reading on the same "precise" scale. It is generally true, however, that more
precise instruments are designed with finer scales or more digits in their
numerical display.

To understand better the difference between accuracy and precision consider a
voltmeter that measures voltage consistently and reliably with the precision of
1 mV. A measurement of the voltage of an accurate standard source used for
calibration of instruments gives a voltage 5 mV too high. This last error is the
measure of the voltmeter accuracy. Its measurements were quite precise but the
instrument was not well calibrated and showed consistently higher values. Such
an instrument is still quite useful since we are often interested in comparing
different voltages and this meter is able to measure the ratio of two voltages
much better than it measures their absolute values.

In considering the effect of precision of instruments on measurement errors we
are usually concerned with relative rather than absolute numbers. An error of
0.1 V for measurement of power line voltage of 117 V is very acceptable, since
it gives the relative error of 0.1/117 < 0.1 % The same absolute error in a
measurement of an amplifier output of 1 V gives a large relative error of 10%.
