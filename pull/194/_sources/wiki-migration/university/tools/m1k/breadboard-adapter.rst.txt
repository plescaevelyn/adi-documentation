ADALM1000 Breadboard Adapters
=============================

All of the analog connections to the ADALM1000 learning module are made though
the 6/8 pin single row female header (0.1" centers) connector. The 6/8 pin
female header provides +5 V and +2.5 V power supplies along with two ground
connection points in the center of the header. The two analog input / output
pins are on the two outside end pins. A very simplified block diagram of one of
the analog channels is shown in figure 1. There are two additional optional
input only pins that are not populated on the standard 6 pin header (rev D
board), shown with white circles around them in figure 2. The user can
optionally populate these extra two pin locations to separate the analog output
and input functions which by default share the common analog channel pin. There
are extra switches not shown in the figure 1 diagram which allow the voltage
measuring "oscilloscope" hardware ( volt meter in diagram ) to be brought out
along with the 1 MΩ input load resistor to a separate pin from the analog output
source. Note figure 3 extracted from revision D schematic.

As we can see from figure 3 switch S\ :sub:`1` disconnects the CH A/B pins from the output drivers, putting that channel in the high impedance mode. Normally, S\ :sub:`4` is closed connecting the analog input buffer ( voltmeter in figure 1 ) to the CH A/B pins. It is also important to note that the white circle pin(rev D) and AIN/BIN pins (Rev F) is connected to CH A/B when S\ :sub:`4` is closed. If S\ :sub:`4` is opened then the analog input buffer is disconnected from the CH A/B pins and is now only available at the pin with the white circle and AIN/BIN pins.

This female 6/8 pin header is a very common, generic style connector and is
simple to attach wires to as with the various cables supplied in the kit. Double
length square male pins can serve as gender changers to convert the female end
of the wires into male pins that can be easily inserted into the female header
and the solder-less breadboards often used in the lab for building prototype
circuits. These fly-wires are several inches long and can be awkward to use at
times given the relatively small size and light weight of the ADALM1000 module
and a small solder-less breadboard.

Adapter board
-------------

A more convenient arrangement would be an adapter PC board that connects to the
female connector of ALM1000 and slips over the end of the breadboard connecting
the two power supplies and ground to the four common rails of the breadboard. An
example 1" by 2" adapter PC board layout is shown in figure 4.

   Figure 4 Breadboard adapter layout

The schematic of the adapter board is shown in figure 5. Solder-less breadboards
commonly come with double rows of common bused sockets along the top and bottom.
See figure 6. These power and ground busses are usually labeled with + and -
signs and colored red and black or blue lines. It is assumed that the adapter is
inserted into the left hand end of the solder-less breadboard with the + red
line marked bus on the top. The +5 V (red) power supply and ground (blue) will
be connected to the top two power rails and the +2.5 V (red) and ground (blue)
will be connected to the bottom two power rails.

The analog input/output pins are routed to the left two end vertical rows of 5
sockets. Labeled with 29 and 30 in figure 6. Channel A is on the lower set and
channel B on the upper set. The board in notched out to allow access to the
remaining sockets in those rows.

The signals and power supplies that ADALM1000 can generate are limited by the +5
V USB power available from the computer. The analog inputs can measure 0 to +5
volt signals. This limitation on the allowable voltages that can be measured can
be expanded through the use of a resistor voltage divider. Two configurable
voltage dividers are included on the board. These work in conjunction with the
internal 1 MΩ input resistance of the ALM1000 when in the "high Z" measurement
mode. Jumpers JP1 and JP2 allow the divider output to be connected to either the
default combined Input/output pin or the optional input only pin. Resistors R2
and R4 are the inputs of the dividers. R1 and R3 can be connected through
jumpers JP3 and JP4 to either the +2.5 V or +5 V supplies to inject an offset to
allow the measurement of negative voltages. Depending on the resistor values
chosen, various ranges can be produced. For example, with R1 equal to 500 KΩ and
connected to +5 V and R2 set to 1 MΩ the divider factor will be 4X with an
offset such that 0 V in will result in +2.5 V as seen by the M1000, -10 V seen
as 0V and +10 V seen as +5 V. This range is only valid for ideal resistors and
will vary depending on resistor tolerance and the actual value of the +5V
supply. Any differences can be calculated out with software calibration.

The input capacitance of the analog inputs in the high Z mode is approximately
380 pF. This capacitance with relatively high resistance levels can
significantly lower the frequency response of the resistor divider. Places for
compensation capacitors are provide across the input resistors R2 and R4. Two
positions C1,2 and C3,4 are provided to best match the required capacitance
using standard off the shelf values. Using Spice simulation and empirical
testing it was found that for the example case with R1 = 500 KΩ and R2 = 1 MΩ,
two 68 pF capacitors in parallel (total of 136 pF) provided nearly optimal
compensation. An adjustable trimmer capacitor could of course be used in one of
the capacitor positions to more precisely adjust the compensation. The effective
input impedance will be 1.333 MΩ and 96 pF.

Another adapter board
---------------------

Another possibility is to configure a larger PCB with a prototyping area and
bring all the ADALM1000 connections to female headers positioned right alongside
the breadboard area. By using female headers simple 22 gauge wire jumpers can be
used to connect to the breadboard rather than the long female to female
fly-wires supplied with the kit. An example 3.1" by 3.4" adapter PC board layout
is shown in figure 7.

   Figure 7 Prototyping adapter layout

The board consists of a grid of 21 by 30 plated through holes on 0.1" centers
which can be used to solder test circuits. Three of the columns of holes on the
left side of the grid are shorted together and tied to the +5V, +2.5V and ground
connections on the 6/8 pin right angle male header connector that mates with
ALM1000. Three of the columns of holes on the right side of the grid are shorted
together and tied to the +9V, -9V and ground connections for use with external
batteries or other sources of power. The 6/8 analog I/O connections are brought
next to the breakout space with a 2 by 8 pin vertical female header positioned
alongside the breadboard area. The row of pins next to the breadboard area are
just directly connected from the analog ALM1000 right angle male connector. The
remaining pins are connected to a pair of resistor divider networks just as in
the previous adapter board.

Space for a 6 pin male header for connecting the ALM1000 digital I/O pins to the
breadboard is provided. It simply directly connects to a 6 pin female header
slot also positioned alongside the breadboard area. These digital pins will not
plug directly into the ALM1000 digital connector because it is not on the same
side of the module as the analog connector. A short set of male to female jumper
wires can be used for those connections. Figure 8 shows the prototyping adapter
schematic.

   Figure 8 Prototyping adapter schematic

The pin mapping for the 2X8 and 2X6 female header connectors are shown in figure
9. The right hand side of the 2X8 header follows the 8 analog pins of the
ALM1000 exactly. The left and side provides access to the two resistor dividers.
The 2X6 female header breaks-out the connections to the on board dual op-amp and
provides connections to the various power and ground rails, GND, +2.5 V, +5 V
and the external +9 V and -9 V.

   Figure 9 Header pin map

The 21 X 30 grid is sized to accommodate the popular 30 position (400 total
connection points) solder-less breadboards, figure 6, with power buses along
both sides which are 2 1/8" by 3 1/4". These breadboards come with adhesive
backs that will stick the breadboard to the prototype adapter PC board.

This adapter board provides a place to connect external power sources such as a
pair of 9 V batteries. A socket for a dual op-amp is included with the two
amplifiers configured as non-inverting gain stages and are powered from the
external power supplies. A pair of resistors for each amplifier sets the gain.
Depending on the choice of amplifier it can be used, for example, to boost the
voltage available from the analog outputs or for other purposes in the circuit
being prototyped. The external power supplies along with the inputs and outputs
of the two amplifiers fill out a 2X6 pin female header also placed along the
side of the breadboard area.

The amplifiers can be easily configured as a two amplifier instrumentation
amplifier as shown in figure 10. In addition to doing differential to single
ended conversion this In-amp can add an offset to center the output voltage
swing on the 0 to +5 V input range of the ALM1000.

Another possible use would be to generate complementary or differential signals
from one of the analog outputs. By connecting one input to ground, with the
other input connected to one of the analog outputs and adjusting the resistor
values, the first amplifier acts as a non-inverting stage to generate the in
phase or true output and the other amplifier acts as an inverting stage to
generate the 180º phase or complement output. To make it easy to swap resistor
values individual pin sockets could be installed rather than directly soldering
the resistors to the board. Likewise using a socket for the op-amp would allow
you to interchange different devices optimized for the intended application.

The ADALM1000 hardware itself is rather small and light weight and special care
should be taken when using this adapter. It might be useful to add small stick
on rubber feet to the underside of the adapter board to help prevent it from
tipping or sliding around on the work surface.
