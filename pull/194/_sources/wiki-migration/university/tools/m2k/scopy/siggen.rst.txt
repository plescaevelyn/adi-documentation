General Description

The signal generator instrument can be used to generate analog output from the
M2K with user configurable parameters. It consists of 3 parts:

::

   *Channel selector - enable/disable channels as well as each channel's control panel.
   *Signal Plot - visual representation of the signals
   *Control Panel - change signal paramteres

Four types of signals can be generated.

-  Constant - DC signal at a user selectable amplitude
-  Waveform - AC signal with various customizable parameters
-  Buffer - signal is imported from a file
-  Math - signal is defined by a mathematical equation

Constant signal only has one parameter which inputs the amplitude of the signal
Waveform signal type can be one of the following

-  Sine
-  Square
-  Triangle
-  Trapezoidal
-  Rising sawtooth
-  Falling sawtooth

All signals have amplitude, offset, phase and frequency parameters. Selecting
Square wave will also unlock the duty cycle parameter. Selecting trapezoidal
waveform will disable the frequency, as this parameter will be computed from the
other 4 values in the Timing category (Rise time, High time, Fall time, Low
Time)

Buffer signal type takes a file as an input. The supported file types for
buffered signals are:

-  .bin - 32 bit binary float format
-  .wav - Waveform Audio File Format (16 bit integers)
-  .csv - Comma separated values
-  .mat - MATLAB Mat format

CSV file format supports raw CSVs such as https://gist.github.com/adisuciu/7aa30bc9e545db23a17e86d23ae4f53c, as well as Scopy formatted CSVs such as https://gist.github.com/adisuciu/5abffa8233707c7b95585e80fbb1dde9. This means it is possible to acquire a signal in the oscilloscope and play it back in the signal generator.

The scope sample rate is 100 MSPS (or factors of ten less) and the signal generator sample rate is 75MSPS (or factors of 10 less) so scope samples do not inherently match up with generator samples. Scope samples would need to be re-sampled by a factor of 3 to 4 to have the signal frequency played back properly. XHIDDENEND

MAT file format only supports arrays of type real (no complex waveforms)

Math signal type allows generation of a signal that is defined as a math
equation. .

On top of all the signals noise can be added. By selecting None, no noise is
added to the signal. The rest of the noise types are:

-  Uniform
-  Gaussian
-  Laplacian
-  Impulse

The noise is only calculated once on the host, and simply added to the waveform
buffer. This means that for cyclic waveforms the noise will be the same on each
period.

   -  Select Math mode and input a function such as 2*(cos(6000\*pi\*t)*sin(2000\*pi\*t))
   -  Set sample rate to 75MSPS (this is the sample rate of the generated signal)
   -  Set record run length to 1ms.
   -  Run the signal
   -  Monitor oscilloscope

   .. note::

      Sample rate & record length parameters: Since t goes from 0 to infinity,
      we need to specify how long will t be generated for the specified function
      - in this case it will go from 0 to 1ms with 75 MSPS granularity(13.3333
      ns). These settings will generate (1 \* 10^-3) \* (75 \* 10 ^9) points =
      75000 points.
