User Guides

Scopy interacts with only one hardware device at a time. Once a device is selected to be used with the application, a list of instruments that are available for that device will be enabled. Each instrument can be opened from the left menu. The icon on the right of the instrument name specifies that the instrument is enabled and provides a shortcut that allows an instrument to be turned on or off.

The instruments menu can be minimized by clicking on the **Scopy** button near the top-left window.
