45W Benchtop Power Supply Project
=================================

Overview
--------

You can never have too many power supplies. Well, that's a bit of an
exaggeration - if you have so many power supplies that they displace so much
oxygen in your lab that you can't breathe, you have too many. But you get the
idea. Even though power supplies seem simple at first glance, they vary widely
in their capabilities and intended applications. A well-equipped lab bench will
have several commercial power supplies with several adjustable outputs, ideally
with "lots of" current capability AND adjustable current limit. And while most
of the time it does not make sense to try to make your own test equipment - like
oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, etc., power supplies are
an exception.

In this tutorial, we will build a highly capable 45W power supply with an output
voltage range of 1 to 16V, adjustable current limit from 0 to 3 amps. The
topology is an LDO (linear) output stage with a buck preregulator, limiting the
maximum power dissipation to about 7W.
