Activity: Temperature Control using Window Comparator
=====================================================

Objective
---------

The objective of this lab activity is to use two high speed voltage comparators
as a Window-Comparator and program the TMP01 Low Power Programmable Temperature
Controller using this approach.

A Window-Comparator is a circuit configuration, usually consisting of a pair of voltage comparators (inverting and non-inverting), in which the output indicates whether an input signal is within the voltage range bounded by two different thresholds. One which triggers an op-amp comparator on detection of some upper voltage threshold, V\ :sub:`REF(HIGH)` and one which triggers an op-amp comparator on detection of a lower voltage threshold level, V\ :sub:`REF(LOW)`. The voltage levels between these two upper and lower reference voltages is called the “window”.

Background

Consider the circuit presented in Figure 1.

   Figure 1 Window Comparator

The circuit uses a voltage divider network, formed of three equal value resistors R1 = R2 = R3. The voltage drops across each resistor will also be equal at one-third of the reference voltage (V\ :sub:`REF`). Therefore, the upper reference (V\ :sub:`REF(HIGH)`) is set to 2/3V\ :sub:`REF` and the lower reference to 1/3V\ :sub:`REF`.

Considering that we use the When V\ :sub:`IN` is below the lower voltage level, (V\ :sub:`REF(LOW)`) which equates to 1/3V\ :sub:`REF`, the output will be HIGH and D2 will be forward biased. Due to the positive voltage at base the npn transistor, Q1 moves into the saturation. Thus, the output voltage is zero, and the supply voltage will drop on R5 and D3, turning the LED on.

When V\ :sub:`IN` exceeds this 1/3V\ :sub:`REF` lower voltage level and it is below 2/3V\ :sub:`REF` (V\ :sub:`REF(HIGH)`), both comparators' outputs will be LOW and the diodes reverse-biased. No voltage is applied to the base of Q1,the transistor is in cut-off and no collector current flows through R6 or R5, D3. The output voltage is the supply voltage V+.

When V\ :sub:`IN` is above the upper voltage level, (V\ :sub:`REF(HIGH)`) which equates to 2/3V\ :sub:`REF`, the output will be HIGH and D1 will be forward biased. Due to the positive voltage at base the npn transistor, Q1 moves into the saturation. Thus, the output voltage is zero, and the supply voltage will drop on R5 and D3, turning the LED on.

Temperature Control
-------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

An example of a window comparator application is a simple temperature controller circuit (Figure 2). The temperature sensor, TMP01, has the dual comparator configuration of figure 1 built in. By choosing the proper values for R\ :sub:`1`, R\ :sub:`2` and R\ :sub:`3` the circuit monitors if the temperature holds in the required range (25 ± ~10 °C).

The TMP01 is a linear voltage-output temperature sensor, with a window
comparator that can be programmed by the user to activate one of two
open-collector outputs when a predetermined temperature set point voltage has
been exceeded. A low drift voltage reference is available for set point
programming. By connecting the two open collector outputs together as a single
wire OR output we can obtain a signal which is at a logic high when the ambient
temperature is within the target window.

Programming TMP01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the basic fixed set point application utilizing a simple resistor ladder
voltage divider, the desired temperature set points are programmed in the
following sequence:

1. Select the desired hysteresis temperature.

2. Calculate the hysteresis current I\ :sub:`VREF`.

3. Select the desired set point temperatures.

4. Calculate the individual resistor divider ladder values needed to develop the
   desired comparator set point voltages at SET HIGH and SET LOW.

The hysteresis current is readily calculated. For example, for 2 degrees of hysteresis, I\ :sub:`VREF` = 17 μA. Next, the set point voltages, V\ :sub:`SETHIGH` and V\ :sub:`SETLOW`, are determined using the VPTAT scale factor of 5 mV/K = 5 mV/(°C + 273.15), which is 1.49 V for 25°C. Then, calculate the divider resistors, based on those set points. The equations used to calculate the resistors are:

V\ :sub:`SETHIGH` = (T\ :sub:`SETHIGH`\ + 273.15) (5 mV/°C)

V\ :sub:`SETLOW` = (T\ :sub:`SETLOW` + 273.15) (5 mV/°C)

R\ :sub:`1` (in kΩ) = (V\ :sub:`VREF`\ −V\ :sub:`SETHIGH`)/I\ :sub:`VREF`\ = (2.5 V −V\ :sub:`SETHIGH`)/I\ :sub:`VREF`

R\ :sub:`2` (in kΩ) = (V\ :sub:`SETHIGH`\ −V\ :sub:`SETLOW`)/I\ :sub:`VREF`

R\ :sub:`3` (in kΩ) = V\ :sub:`SETLOW`/I\ :sub:`VREF`

The total R\ :sub:`1` + R\ :sub:`2` + R\ :sub:`3` is equal to the load resistance needed to draw the desired hysteresis current from the reference, or I\ :sub:`VREF`.

I\ :sub:`VREF` = 2.5V/( R\ :sub:`1` + R\ :sub:`2` + R\ :sub:`3`)

Since VREF = 2.5 V, with a reference load resistance of 357 kΩ or greater
(output current 7 μA or less), the temperature setpoint hysteresis is zero
degrees. Larger values of load resistance only decrease the output current below
7 μA and have no effect on the operation of the device. The amount of hysteresis
is determined by selecting a value of load resistance for VREF.
