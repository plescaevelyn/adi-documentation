Activity: Diode I vs. V curves, For ADALM2000
=============================================

Objective:
----------

The purpose of this activity is to investigate the current vs. voltage
characteristics of a PN junction diode.

Materials:
----------

ADALM2000 Active Learning Module Solder-less Breadboard 1 - Resistor (1KΩ or any
similar value from 1KΩ to 5KΩ) 1 - small signal diode (1N914 or similar)

Directions:
-----------

The current vs. voltage characteristics of the PN junction diode can be measured
using the ADALM2000 Board and the following connections. The green boxes
indicate where to connect the ADALM2000 board. Set up the breadboard with
waveform generator output, W1, attached to one end of the resistor. The 2+ scope
input is also connected here. The other end of the resistor is connected to one
end of the diode as shown in the first diagram. The 2- scope input as well as
the 1+ scope input is also connected to the second end of the resistor. The
other end of the diode is connected to ground along with the 1- scope input.

   Figure 1. Connection diagram for diode I/V curves

Hardware Setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The waveform generator should be configured for a 100 Hz triangle wave with 6 volt amplitude peak-to-peak and 0 volt offset. The differential input of scope channel 2 (2+,2-) is used to measure the current in the resistor (and diode). The Single ended input of scope channel 1 (1+) is used to measure the voltage across the diode (1- input can be grounded). The Scope should be setup with channel 1 at 500mV per division and channel 2 set also at 500mV per division. The current flowing through the diode, I\ :sub:`D`, is the voltage measured by channel 2 divided by the resistor value (1KΩ in this example). Use the XY display mode to plot the voltage across the diode (scope channel 1) on the X axis vs. the current in the diode (scope channel 2) on the Y axis.

Questions:
----------

What is the mathematical expression for the diode current, I\ :sub:`D`, given the voltage across the diode V\ :sub:`D`?

Further exploration on diode characteristics:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Measure the diode characteristics, V\ :sub:`D` at a fixed I\ :sub:`D`, of multiple 1N914 diodes; there should be four included in the ADALP2000 Analog Parts Kit and ask to exchange some with a lab-mate to get even more samples. Calculate the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of your measurements, (CV is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean as a percentage ). Discuss the amount of variation you observe, which is often a measure of what semiconductor engineers call process variation.

Replace the 1N914 diodes with a light-emitting diode, or LED. You should have red, yellow, green and infrared LEDs in the ADALP2000 Analog Parts Kit. Do the LED diodes have similar mathematical expressions for the diode current, I\ :sub:`D`, given the voltage across the diode V\ :sub:`D`\ as the IN914? In what way are the similar and in what way are they different? Do the red, yellow and green LEDs "turn on" at the same forward voltage?

Activity 2a. Half wave rectifier

input and by how much? At what point in the input waveform does the rectified
waveform become positive i.e. something other than zero? What happens if the
direction of the diode is reversed? Repeat the experiment with the direction of
the diode reversed.

Further Exploration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace the 1N914 diode with a light-emitting diode, or LED. You probably need
to increase the AWG1 amplitude to 10V peak-to-peak to accommodate the higher
forward voltage drop of the LED. 1. How does the waveform for the rectified
output compare to your earlier results with the 1N914 diode? By how much does
the forward-bias voltage drop increase? 2. Experiment with the three different
waveform shapes while the waveform generator remains set to 100 Hz, pay
attention to the brightness of the LED. Discuss your observations of waveform
shape and brightness and relate these observations to your measured effective DC
values for each waveform shape. 3. Reduce the waveform generator frequency, and
experiment with values as low at 0.2 Hz (one cycle every five seconds). Discuss
the behavior of the LED optical intensity for each of the three waveform shapes
when the waveform generator frequency is 1 Hz or less. 4. At what frequency does
the flashing LED stop flickering and begin to appear as a constant intensity?

Activity 2b. Full wave rectifier
================================

Objective:
----------

The purpose of this activity is to investigate the use of two diodes as a full
wave rectifier.

Materials:
----------

1 - Resistor (4.7KΩ or any similar value) 2 - small signal Diodes (1N914 or
similar)

Directions:
-----------

Set up the breadboard with W1 attached to one end of the first diode, D\ :sub:`1`, and W2 to one end of the second diode, D\ :sub:`2`. Both diodes should face in the same direction. The other end of each diode is connected to one end of the load resistor as shown figure 9. The other end of the resistor is connected to ground. Single ended input of scope channel 2 (2+) is connected to the junction of the resistor and the two diodes.

|image9|

   Figure 9. Connection diagram for full wave diode rectifier

Hardware Setup:
---------------

The first waveform generator, W1, should be configured for a 100 Hz Sine wave
with 6 volt amplitude peak-to-peak and 0 volt offset. The second AWG generator,
W2, should be configured also for a 100 Hz Sine wave with 6 volt peak-to-peak
amplitude and 0 volt offset but with the phase set to 180 degrees. The Single
ended input of scope channel 2 (2+) is used to measure the voltage across the
load resistor. Both scope channels should be set to 500mV per division.

|image10|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 10. Full Wave Diode Rectifier Breadboard Circuit

Procedure:
----------

Plot the two waveforms using the Oscilloscope provided by the Scopy tool. If
both 0 degree and 180 degree phases of the AC input are available, then a second
diode can fill in the missing half-wave of the input and produce the full-wave
rectified signal shown in this plot. Again the forward voltage of the diodes is
apparent and the output waveform does not come to a sharp point at the zero
crossing due to the non-zero turn on voltage of the diodes.

|image11|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11. Full Wave rectified waveform

Questions:
----------

-  What happens if the direction of the diodes is reversed? Repeat experiment with the direction of both diodes reversed.
-  What happens if the direction of one diode is opposite of the other? Repeat experiment with the direction of one diode (D\ :sub:`1`) reversed.
-  How could both 0 degree and 180 degree phases be created from a single source
   (a transformer?)?

Further exploration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace D\ :sub:`1` and D\ :sub:`2` with red and green LEDs. Increase the amplitude of AWG1 to 10V peak-to-peak( to accommodate the higher turn on voltage of the LEDs ). Slow the frequency of AWG1 to 5 Hz or less. Are the two LEDs ever both on at the same time? 1. How does the waveform for the rectified output compare to your earlier results with the 1N914 diodes? By how much does the forward-bias voltage drop increase? 2. Experiment with the three different waveform shapes while the waveform generator is set to 100 Hz, pay attention to the brightness of the LEDs. Discuss your observations of waveform shape and brightness and relate these observations to your measured effective DC values for each waveform shape. 3. Reduce the waveform generator frequency, and experiment with values as low at 0.2 Hz (one cycle every five seconds). Discuss the behavior of the LED optical intensity for each of the three waveform shapes when the waveform generator frequency is 1 Hz or less. 4. At what frequency do the flashing LEDs stop flickering and begin to appear as a constant intensity?

disadvantage of this circuit is that now two diode drops are in series with the
load and the peak value of the rectified output is less than the AC input by 1.2
Volts rather than the 0.6 V in the previous circuits.

be connected to ground rather than how it is shown figure 4 with one end of the
AC source grounded?

Further exploration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Increase the amplitude of AWG1 to 10V peak-to-peak ( to accommodate the higher turn on voltage of the LEDs ). Slow the frequency of AWG1 to 5 Hz or less. Are two of LEDs ever both on at the same time? If so which two? 1. How does the waveform for the rectified output compare to your earlier results with the 1N914 diodes? By how much does the forward-bias voltage drop increase? 2. Experiment with the three different waveform shapes while the waveform generator is set to 100 Hz, pay attention to the brightness of the LEDs. Discuss your observations of waveform shape and brightness and relate these observations to your measured effective DC values for each waveform shape. 3. Reduce the waveform generator frequency, and experiment with values as low at 0.2 Hz (one cycle every five seconds). Discuss the behavior of the LED optical intensity for each of the three waveform shapes when the waveform generator frequency is 1 Hz or less. 4. At what frequency do the flashing LEDs stop flickering and begin to appear as a constant intensity?

   Figure 20. DC Restoration waveforms

Replace diode D\ :sub:`1` in the circuit with a 10K resistor. Using the measurement tab on the Scope, read and record the positive and negative peak values and mean value of channel2 (2+) as the offset of waveform generator channel 1 is changed between -1 and +1 volt. Now set waveform generator channel 1 to a square wave again with 2V peak-to-peak amplitude value. As done before read and record the positive and negative peak values and the mean value as the duty cycle of the square wave is changed between 10% and 90%. Now remove the 10KΩ resistor and put diode D\ :sub:`1` back in place. Repeat the same measurements, adjusting DC offset and duty cycle, that were just taken with resistor. How do they compare? Reverse the direction of diode D1 and again repeat these same measurements. How do they compare to the previous two?

Questions:
----------

What happened when the direction of D\ :sub:`1` was reversed? What is the effect of setting different DC values for the output of generator 2 (W2)?

Activity 2f. Variable attenuator
================================

Objective:
----------

The goal of this activity is to build, characterize and analyze a small signal
variable attenuator using a diode.

Materials:
----------

peak-to-peak amplitude (or less) and offset set to 0. The set scope channel 1+
at 100mV per division and scope channel 2+ connected R4 at 100mV per division.

Procedure:
----------

|image23|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 23. Variable Attenuator waveforms

The purpose of C\ :sub:`1` (and C\ :sub:`2`) is to block DC current from the input and output circuits so the operating point of the diode is not affected. The attenuator uses the fact that that "small signal" resistance of the diode r\ :sub:`D` is a function the DC current flowing in the diode I\ :sub:`D`. See Equations below: |image24| |image25| Where: n is the diode area ( size ) scale factor V\ :sub:`T` is the Thermal Voltage I\ :sub:`D` is the diode current k is Boltzmann's constant q is the electron charge T is the absolute temperature

In the circuit a voltage divider is set up between R\ :sub:`1` and the resistance of D\ :sub:`1`. The current in D\ :sub:`1`\ is varied by changing the current in R\ :sub:`2`. When the current in D\ :sub:`1` is small r\ :sub:`D`\ is large and the fraction of the input signal seen at the output is large. As the current in D\ :sub:`1` increases, its resistance decreases and the fraction of the input seen at the output decreases.

Questions:
----------

What is the maximum input signal level that you can use without distorting the
output signal? What circuit parameter determines the upper limit of the input
signal?

Activity 2g. Absolute value circuits
====================================

Objective:
----------

The purpose of this activity is to investigate absolute value circuits.
Rectifiers, or 'absolute-value' circuits are often used as detectors to convert
the amplitudes of AC signals to DC values to be more easily measured. For this
type of circuit, the AC signal is first high-pass filtered to remove any DC term
and then rectified and perhaps low pass filtered. As we have seen in the simple
rectifier circuits constructed with diodes, the circuit does not respond well to
signals with a magnitude less than a diode-drop (0.6V for silicon diodes). This
limits their use in designs where small amplitudes are to be measured. For
designs in which a high degree of precision is needed, op-amps can be used in
conjunction with diodes to build precision rectifiers.

Materials:
----------

1 - Dual Op AMP (such as ADTL082 or similar) 5 - 10KΩ Resistors 2 - small signal
Diodes (1N914 or similar) 2 - 4.7uF decoupling capacitors

Directions:
-----------

The inverting op-amp circuit can be converted into an "ideal" (linear precision) half-wave rectifier by adding two diodes as shown in figure 24. For the negative half of the input diode D\ :sub:`1` is reverse biased and diode D\ :sub:`2` is forward biased and the circuit operates as a conventional inverter with a gain of -1. For the positive half of the input, diode D\ :sub:`1` is forward biased, closing the feedback around the amplifier. Diode D\ :sub:`2` is reverse biased disconnecting the output from the amplifier. The output will be at the virtual ground potential ( - input terminal ) through the 10K ohm resistor.

   Figure 25. Precision Half-Wave Rectifier Breadboard Circuit

Procedure:
----------

The peak of the rectified output, as seen in the plot here, is now equal to the
peak value of the input. There is also a sharp transition as the input crosses
zero. The experimenter should investigate the waveforms at different points in
the circuit to explain why this circuit works better than the simple diode half
wave rectifier.

|image27|

   Figure 26. Precision Half-Wave Rectifier waveforms

Directions:
-----------

The circuit shown in figure 27 is an absolute value circuit, often called a
precision full-wave rectifier. It should operate like a full wave rectifier
circuit constructed with ideal diodes ( the voltage across the diode, in forward
conduction, equals 0 volts). The actual diodes used in the circuit will have a
forward voltage of around 0.6 V.

Procedure:
----------

For this laboratory exercise you should: a) Study the circuit and determine how
it works. There is very fundamental concept that should help in understanding
how this circuit operates. Given an op-amp configured with negative feedback,
the inverting and non-inverting input terminals will try to reach the same
voltage level, often referred to as a virtual short. b) Plan some tests to see
if this circuit indeed is an absolute value circuit. Perform these tests, fully
documenting all tests and results. c) Make the input voltage a 6 Volt amplitude
sinusoid, at 1KHz. Carefully measure and record voltages at all nodes in the
circuit.

Activity 2h. A Voltage Doubler circuit
======================================

Voltage doublers are very useful in situations where the load current is
relatively light, and the required DC voltage is higher than what is available
from the system power supply.

|image30|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 30. Connection diagram for voltage doubler circuit

How this circuit operates is not as straight-forward as the diode rectifier circuits we examined earlier. To understand this circuit we need to take a look at it during successive half-cycles of the ac input from W1. We will start by assuming ideal components and that C\ :sub:`1` = C\ :sub:`2`.

-   During the first negative half-cycle, D\ :sub:`1` will be forward biased and will hold the right end of C\ :sub:`1` at one diode drop below ground. Therefore C\ :sub:`1` will charge to a voltage nearly equal to the peak voltage (v\ :sub:`peak`) of the AC input, with its left end being negative with respect to ground.<sub> </sub>
-   During the following positive half cycle, D\ :sub:`1` will be reverse biased and will not conduct current. The voltage on C\ :sub:`1` will add to the AC input voltage, so a voltage of approximately 2v\ :sub:`peak` will appear at the left end of D\ :sub:`2`. Since C\ :sub:`2` is not yet charged at all, this will forward bias D\ :sub:`2` and allow the voltage at the right end of C\ :sub:`1` to be applied to the top of C\ :sub:`2`. C\ :sub:`2` will charge as C\ :sub:`1` discharges, until the two capacitors can no longer forward-bias D\ :sub:`2`. For the first positive half-cycle, the voltage on C\ :sub:`2` will be equal to v\ :sub:`peak`, and C\ :sub:`1` will be completely discharged, so that all the voltage at the left end of D\ :sub:`2` comes from the AC input.<sub> </sub>
-   On the next negative half-cycle, C1 charges again to v\ :sub:`peak`, through D\ :sub:`1`. If there is no load to discharge C\ :sub:`2`, its output will remain at +v\ :sub:`peak`.<sub> </sub>
-   On the second positive half-cycle, C\ :sub:`2` is still charged to +v\ :sub:`peak`, while the voltage at the left end of D\ :sub:`2` is again +2v\ :sub:`peak`. Again, C\ :sub:`1` transfers part of its charge to C\ :sub:`2`, but this time they stop when C\ :sub:`2` is charged to a voltage of +1.5v\ :sub:`peak`.<sub> </sub>
-   This action continues, cycle by cycle, with C\ :sub:`1` being fully recharged to v\ :sub:`p` on each negative half cycle, and then charging C\ :sub:`2` to a voltage halfway between its starting voltage and +2v\ :sub:`peak`. C\ :sub:`2` will never quite charge to +2v\ :sub:`peak`, but it will come very close.<sub> </sub>

With non-ideal components there is a small (0.6) voltage drop across each diode when it is forward biased. This will reduce the maximum no load output voltage of the doubler. Any load on this circuit, such as R\ :sub:`L`, will draw current from C\ :sub:`2` at all times, thus discharging this capacitor to some extent. On each positive half-cycle C\ :sub:`1` will recharge C\ :sub:`2` from the voltage it had at the start of the half-cycle halfway up to +2v\ :sub:`peak`. The ripple on the output will be larger and the average DC value will be lower.

Note that the output current capacity of this circuit is only half the current capacity of a normal rectifier circuit. Any additional load current taken from the voltage doubler will simply cause C\ :sub:`2` to discharge faster, thus reducing the output voltage. It is never possible to get more power out of the voltage doubler than goes into it.

The charging and recharging of C\ :sub:`2`\ can be made faster if C\ :sub:`1` is made larger than C\ :sub:`2`. For example, if C\ :sub:`1` = 10µF and C\ :sub:`2` = 1µF, C\ :sub:`1` can transfer much more charge to C\ :sub:`2` on each positive half-cycle, and the voltage on C\ :sub:`2` will increase much faster than the voltage on C\ :sub:`1` will decrease. Of course, this also means that the output current capacity is even more limited, since C\ :sub:`2` will discharge rapidly as well as charging rapidly.

Questions:
----------

1. This circuit produces a positive DC output voltage. How can it be
   reconfigured to make a negative output voltage? Sketch your voltage inverter
   circuit. Construct the voltage inverter and repeat the experiment / report
   tasks you did with the voltage doubler. 2. What is the minimum peak voltage
   of the AC input below which the circuit no longer functions? 3. Try different
   input waveforms. Which is better, Sine, Square, Triangle and why? How does
   the duty-cycle of the AC input effect the DC output and why?

Activity 2i. Push - Pull Voltage Doubler
========================================

A limitation of the voltage doubler circuit is that it only uses one half
(positive in the previous example) of the AC input. In the next circuit the
diodes and capacitors are rearranged slightly, and are driven in a push-pull or
H bridge fashion. The result is that now two current pulses per cycle are
delivered to the load. The output voltage will be higher by one half the driver
supply voltage. The output will be 2.5X the supply minus two diode drops.

What happens to the output voltage across R\ :sub:`L` if the direction of the four diodes are reversed?
