11.1 Basic principles
---------------------

The implementation of the current mirror circuit may seem simple but there is a lot going on. The simple two transistor implementation of the current mirror is based on the fundamental relationship that two equal size transistors at the same temperature with the same V\ :sub:`GS` for a MOS or V\ :sub:`BE` for a BJT have the same drain or collector current. To best understand this important circuit building block and how it makes use of this relationship we need to deconstruct the circuit into input and output sections and examine each in turn.

A current mirror is a circuit block which functions to produce a copy of the
current flowing into or out of an input terminal by replicating the current in
an output terminal. An important feature of the current mirror is a relatively
high output resistance which helps to keep the output current constant
regardless of load conditions. Another feature of the current mirror is a
relatively low input resistance which helps to keep the input current constant
regardless of drive conditions. The current being 'copied' can be, and often is,
a varying signal current. The current mirror is often used to provide bias
currents and active loads in amplifier stages.

The ideal block level concept of the current mirror is shown in figure 11.1.
Given a current source as the input, the input section of the current mirror
looks like a virtual short circuit and reflects (swaps the direction of flow)
this current to produce a current sink (the current exiting the mirror); as a
result, we obtain a current sink (figure 11.1a). Conversely, given a current
sink as the input, the current mirror reflects this current to control current
source (figure 11.1b); as a result, now we obtain a current source. We can
generalize this basic current mirror structure with this first observation: A
current mirror consists of a low impedance input stage connected to a high
impedance output current stage.

Conceptually, an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal current amplifier with
a gain of -1. In Chapter 8 we explored the transistor and you should recall that
the BJT device is a current amplifier of sorts (current controlled current
source) in that the collector current is β times the base current. The problem
with using this feature directly is that β is not a well controlled value from
device to device and can vary with changes in temperature. Accurate current
amplifiers are difficult to directly implement using conventional transistor
amplifier configurations which are typically voltage amplifiers. For example the
MOS transistor is generally modeled as a voltage controlled current source and
can not be used directly as a current amplifier. The use of feedback and the
current to voltage relationship of two terminal elements such as a resistor are
most often used when manipulating currents as signals. Because in a current
mirror the input and output are currents, it is easier to convert the input to a
voltage first and then convert a voltage back to a current at the output.

It should be noted that these two stages of the current mirror may have a linear relationship (for example where V\ :sub:`OUT` = I\ :sub:`IN`\ R and I\ :sub:`OUT` = V\ :sub:`IN`/R) like a resistor. In figure 11.1.1 we see the classic operational amplifier implementation of the current to voltage converter explored back in Chapter 4 section 2. The virtual ground at the negative input of the op-amp provides a very low input resistance. These circuits use the linear relationship between the current in resistor R1 and the voltage across the resistor. However, this linear relationship is not necessarily required. Any element or combination of elements could be used such as the V\ :sub:`BE` or V\ :sub:`GS` of a transistor as in (b) if the output voltage was taken at the gate of M1 (output of the op-amp).

   Figure 11.1.1 Linear Current to Voltage converter (from Chapter 4)

Similarly, as an output stage we have the operational amplifier implementation
of the voltage to current converter from section 1 of Chapter 4 in figure 1.1.2.
Here the input voltage is forced across resistor R1 such that the resulting
current in R1 flows through transistor M1.

|image3|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11.1.2 Linear Voltage to Current converter (from Chapter 4)

Implementing the block diagram of the current mirror shown in figure 11.1 follows directly from these voltage / current converter stages from Chapter 4, if we connect the output of the I to V converter in figure 11.1.1(b) to the input of the V to I converter in figure 11.1.2. With the two resistors being equal, I\ :sub:`OUT` would be the mirror image of I\ :sub:`IN`. Note that the second op-amp is not actually necessary because the gates of the two NMOS transistors can be tied directly to each other with the same result. Remember that two equal size transistors at the same temperature with the same V\ :sub:`GS` (or V\ :sub:`BE` for a BJT) have the same drain current. This is an important simplification of the current mirror concept.

The converters might consist of non-linear devices having whatever I to V
characteristics that may include another physical quantity (such as
temperature); the only requirement is that the characteristics be the inverse of
each other. For example, if the input I to V stage implements a function v =
f(i) and the output stage implements the inverse function i = f -1(v) the total
input to output transfer function is v = f(i) = f(f -1(v)) . We can make a
second observation: A current mirror consists of two connected stages with
inverse transfer functions of each other.

The converter circuits in figures 11.1.1 and 11.1.2 are rather complicated and
require as many as two operational amplifiers. A much simpler implementation
would be better.

11.2 An input stage to convert current to voltage
-------------------------------------------------

We would like a simple configuration where the active element, a single transistor, serves as the desired current-to-voltage converter. However, the transistor is a unidirectional device, where for the BJT the base emitter voltage controls the collector current or for the FET the gate source voltage controls the drain current. Producing the opposite where the collector current controls the V\ :sub:`BE` is not possible in the conventional use of the device as a common emitter amplifier. Referring back to Figure 11.1.1, the solution is to incorporate negative feedback. In this case that means making the transistor adjust its base emitter or gate source voltage, V\ :sub:`BE` or V\ :sub:`GS`, so that the collector or drain current is I\ :sub:`IN` = (V\ :sub:`1`-V\ :sub:`BE`)/R. For this purpose, we simply connect the collector to the base or gate to drain or "diode connect" the transistor. This classic "diode" connection results in 100% parallel negative feedback (figure 11.2). As a result, with this diode connected transistor, the collector current serves as the input quantity while the base-emitter voltage V\ :sub:`BE` serves as the output quantity with the logarithmic transfer function of the base emitter junction. Similarly, a diode connected enhancement mode MOS FET (gate tied to drain) will serve as a similar current to voltage converter with V\ :sub:`GS` as the output quantity rather than V\ :sub:`BE`.

11.3 An output stage to convert voltage to current
--------------------------------------------------

A bipolar transistor can be driven by a voltage or by a current. If we consider the base emitter voltage, V\ :sub:`BE`, as the input and the collector current, I\ :sub:`C`, as the output (figure 11.3), we can think of a transistor as a non-linear voltage-to-current converter having an exponential characteristic. The base can be directly driven by the voltage output of the I-to-V converter we just discussed. The collector provides the output terminal of our simple current mirror: The output V to I converter stage of the simple current mirror is just a transistor acting as a non-linear (exponential for BJT) voltage-to-current converter. Again if a MOS transistor were used for the input stage the output stage would be a MOS transistor with the gate serving as the voltage input and the drain as the current output.

11.4 Assembling the complete circuit
------------------------------------

The final step is to connect the output of the input stage (the base emitter junction of Q\ :sub:`1`) to the input of the output stage (the base emitter junction of Q\ :sub:`2`) to build the basic BJT current mirror circuit (figure 11.4). At this point we will concentrate on the issues involved with the BJT current mirror and pick back up with the MOS current mirror in section 11.6.

|image6|

11.4.1 Mirror Gain other than 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If transistors Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` in figure 11.4 are identical (that is have the same size emitter and thus equal I\ :sub:`S`) the input current to output current ratio or gain is ideally 1. There are often occasions when a gain other than one is required. When building circuits from discrete devices only simple integer ratios are possible while in microelectronic integrated circuits it is possible to make transistors with arbitrary emitter areas, A. However, even in integrated circuits the best design practice is to use identical unit size transistors when making current mirrors.

|image7|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11.4.1, Current Mirror with non-unary gain ratio

If on the input side of the mirror we connect N identical devices in parallel and connect M devices in parallel on the output side, the gain of the mirror will be M/N. In figure 11.4.1 we see an example where 2 (N=2) devices are connected together on the input and 3 (M=3) devices are connected together on the output. The mirror gain will thus be 3/2 or 1.5. Since all five transistors share the same V\ :sub:`BE`\ voltage, their collector currents, I\ :sub:`C`, will all be equal. The input current I\ :sub:`IN` splits equally in Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` such that:

:math:`I_C = I_IN/2` , :math:`I_OUT = 3I_C` or :math:`\displaystyle (\frac{3}{2})I_IN`

11.5 Imperfections of the simple mirror
---------------------------------------

There are three primary error sources that make the simple 2 transistor mirror less than ideal. The first is the mirror gain. Ideally I\ :sub:`OUT` should exactly equal I\ :sub:`IN`. There are systematic and random factors that make this not the case. The second is the incremental output resistance, which determines how much the output current varies with the voltage seen at the mirror output. The third limitation is the minimum voltage drop across the output leg of the mirror necessary to maintain the desired output current. This minimum voltage, called output compliance, is determined by the need to keep the output transistor of the mirror in the active region. There are also a number of secondary performance issues with mirrors, for example, temperature stability and frequency response.

11.5.1 Gain Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An error source in this simple BJT based current mirror is that the transistors Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` (figure 11.4) each remove a base current I\ :sub:`B` from the input current I\ :sub:`IN`. As a result, the output current is smaller than the input current:

:math:`I_OUT = I_IN - 2I_B`

As was already discussed, current mirrors can just as easily be made from MOS
FET transistors. The I-to-V and V-to-I functions are different but of course are
still the inverse of each other. A significant advantage of the MOS current
mirror is the lack of base current induced error that BJT current mirrors
suffer. There are methods to correct or compensate for the base current in BJT
current mirrors which will be discussed in detail in later sections of this
chapter.

11.5.2 Compliance voltage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is necessary to keep the output (BJT) transistor out of saturation, V\ :sub:`CB` = 0 V. Or from another perspective, not allow the collector base junction to forward bias. That means the lowest output voltage that results in the correct output current, the compliance voltage, is V\ :sub:`OUT` = V\ :sub:`CV` = V\ :sub:`BE` under bias conditions with the output transistor at the output current level I\ :sub:`C` and with V\ :sub:`CB` = 0 V or, restating the V\ :sub:`BE`\ relation from earlier:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/courses/electronics/text/chptr11-e1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 150

Where V\ :sub:`T` is the thermal voltage and I\ :sub:`S` is the reverse saturation current.

11.5.3 Output resistance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The V\ :sub:`CB` of Q\ :sub:`1` in the mirror is zero. If V\ :sub:`CB` is greater than zero in the output transistor Q\ :sub:`2`, the collector current in Q\ :sub:`2` will be somewhat larger than Q\ :sub:`1` due to the Early effect. In other words, the mirror has a finite output resistance given by the r\ :sub:`O` of the output transistor, namely:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/courses/electronics/text/chptr11-e2.png
   :align: center
   :width: 200

Where: V\ :sub:`A` is the Early voltage V\ :sub:`CB` is the collector-to-base voltage

As we learned in an earlier chapter, the inclusion of emitter degeneration resistors (R\ :sub:`E1` and R\ :sub:`E2` in figure 11.5) can increase the effective collector impedance seen at the mirror output. In order for the mirror gain to remain equal to 1, R\ :sub:`E1` must of course equal R\ :sub:`E2`. The added voltage drop across the emitter resistor R\ :sub:`E2` (I\ :sub:`OUT` x R\ :sub:`E2`) adds to the minimum allowable output voltage (see section 11.5.2).

While resistors could also be added to the sources in an MOS based mirror, it is
often more effective to simple increase the channel length, L, of the
transistors. The longer the channel the less it is affected by the channel
length modulation due to the increasing drain voltage.

|image8|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11.5, Emitter degeneration included to boot output resistance.

It is important to note that the inclusion of emitter resistors does not reduce the reduction in the output current I\ :sub:`OUT` caused by the finite beta of Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2`. A compensating voltage can be inserted by including resistor R\ :sub:`B`, of the correct value, as shown in figure 11.6.

|image9|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11.6, Adding a resistor in the base of Q\ :sub:`1` tends to compensate for the finite beta of Q\ :sub:`2`

For V\ :sub:`CB` close to zero (that is, neglecting base-width modulation errors) the necessary value for R\ :sub:`B` is:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/courses/electronics/text/chptr11-e3.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300

For example, using A = 2 ( a mirror gain of 2 ), I\ :sub:`IN` = 1mA, so r\ :sub:`E` = 26Ω and R\ :sub:`E1` = 500Ω (introducing about 500mV of degeneration) R\ :sub:`B` should be 1578Ω if β is enough larger than A so that factor can be ignored, or 1626Ω if it is included and beta is 100. Clearly, this compensation method becomes unpredictable when β is small and is comparable to A and will never be precise because β\ :sub:`1` and β\ :sub:`2` are not in general equal. However, this technique can be of practical utility in many cases.

11.6 Basic MOSFET current mirror
--------------------------------

The simple current mirror can, obviously, also be implemented using MOSFET transistors, as shown in figure 11.7. We know that transistor M\ :sub:`1` is operating in the saturation region because V\ :sub:`DS` is greater than or equal to V\ :sub:`GS`. Transistor M\ :sub:`2`\ will also be in saturation so long as the output voltage is larger than its saturation voltage. In this simple configuration, the output current I\ :sub:`OUT` is directly related to I\ :sub:`IN`.

|image10|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11.7 Simple MOS current mirror

The drain current of a MOSFET I\ :sub:`D` is a function of both the gate to source voltage and the drain to gate voltage of the MOSFET given by I\ :sub:`D` = f (V\ :sub:`GS`, V\ :sub:`DG`), a relationship derived from the functionality of the MOSFET device. In the case of transistor M\ :sub:`1` of the mirror, I\ :sub:`D` = I\ :sub:`IN`. Input current I\ :sub:`IN` is a known current, and can be provided by a resistor as shown in the figure, or by a threshold-referenced or self-biased current source to ensure that it is constant, independent of voltage supply variations.

Using V\ :sub:`DG`\ =0 for transistor M\ :sub:`1`, the drain current in M\ :sub:`1` is I\ :sub:`D` = f (V\ :sub:`GS`,V\ :sub:`DG`\ =0), so we find: f (V\ :sub:`GS`, 0) = I\ :sub:`IN`, implicitly determining the value of V\ :sub:`GS`. Thus I\ :sub:`IN` sets the value of V\ :sub:`GS`. The circuit in the diagram forces the same V\ :sub:`GS` to apply to transistor M\ :sub:`2`. If M\ :sub:`2` also is biased with zero V\ :sub:`DG` and provided transistors M\ :sub:`1` and M\ :sub:`2` have good matching of their properties, such as channel length, width, threshold voltage etc., the relationship I\ :sub:`OUT` = f (V\ :sub:`GS`,V\ :sub:`DG`\ =0 ) applies, thus setting I\ :sub:`OUT` = I\ :sub:`IN`; that is, the output current is the same as the input current when V\ :sub:`DG`\ =0 for the output transistor, and both transistors are matched.

The drain-to-source voltage can be expressed as V\ :sub:`DS`\ =V\ :sub:`DG` + V\ :sub:`GS`. With this substitution, the Shichman-Hodges model provides an approximate form for function f(V\ :sub:`GS`,V\ :sub:`DG`):

:math:`\displaystyle I_D = f(V_GS,V_DG ) = \frac{1}{2} K_p (W/L) (V_GS-V_th )^2 (1+λV_DS )`

:math:`\displaystyle I_D = \frac{1}{2} K_p (W/L) (V_GS-V_th )^2 (1+λ(V_DG+V_GS ))`

Where: Kp is a technology related constant associated with the transistor, W/L is the width to length ratio of the transistor, V\ :sub:`GS` is the gate-source voltage, V\ :sub:`th` is the threshold voltage, V\ :sub:`DS` is the drain-source voltage λ is the channel length modulation constant

**Output resistance**

Because of channel-length modulation, the mirror has a finite output resistance given by the *ro* of the output transistor, namely:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/courses/electronics/text/chptr11-e04.png
   :align: center
   :width: 200

Where: λ = channel-length modulation parameter V\ :sub:`DS` = drain-to-source bias.

**Compliance voltage**

To keep the output transistor resistance high, V\ :sub:`DG` = 0 V. That means the lowest output voltage that results in correct mirror behavior, the compliance voltage, is V\ :sub:`OUT` = V\ :sub:`CV` = V\ :sub:`GS` for the output transistor at the output current level with V\ :sub:`DG` = 0 V, or using the inverse of the f- function, f\ :sup:`-1`:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/courses/electronics/text/chptr11-e6.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500

For the Shichman-Hodges model, f\ :sup:`-1` is approximately a square-root function.

11.7 Improved current mirrors
-----------------------------

11.7.1 Buffered Feedback current mirror
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure 11.8 shows a mirror where the simple wire connecting the collector of Q\ :sub:`1` to its base is replaced by an emitter follower buffer. This improvement to the simple current mirror is referred to as an emitter follower augmented mirror. The current gain (ß\ :sub:`Q3`) of the emitter follower buffer stage (Q\ :sub:`3`) greatly reduces the gain error caused by the finite base currents of Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2`.

|image11|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11.8 Buffered Feedback current mirror.

One thing to note that is different in this mirror configuration vs. the simple two transistor mirror is that the Collector-Base voltage, V\ :sub:`CB`, of Q\ :sub:`1` is no longer zero. It is equal to the V\ :sub:`BE` of Q\ :sub:`3`. Given the effect of the finite output resistance (Early effect ) the output current I\ :sub:`OUT` in Q\ :sub:`2` will most closely match I\ :sub:`IN` when the collector voltage of Q\ :sub:`2` is the same as that of Q\ :sub:`1` which is 2XV\ :sub:`BE` above the common voltage. Also note that when driven by a resistor, like R\ :sub:`1`, I\ :sub:`IN` will now be (V\ :sub:`1`-V\ :sub:`BE1`-V\ :sub:`BE2`)/R\ :sub:`1`.

Another consequence of adding the emitter follower buffer is, in general, a loss in the frequency response of the mirror. Transistor Q\ :sub:`3` is potentially operating at a very small current of 2I\ :sub:`B`. If there were to be a significant capacitance to ground at the base connection common to Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` the current available to discharge this current will also be small equal to 2I\ :sub:`B`. But the current available to charge this node is potentially equal to ß\ :sub:`Q3`\ I\ :sub:`IN` which is very much larger than 2I\ :sub:`B`. This asymmetry in the charging vs. discharging current available for this node in the current mirror can lead to very undesirable response to fast changes to I\ :sub:`IN`.

11.7.2 The Wilson current mirror
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Wilson current mirror or Wilson current source, named after George Wilson, is
an improved mirror circuit configuration designed to provide a more constant
current source or sink. It provides a much more accurate input to output current
gain. The structure is shown in figure 11.9.

|image12|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 11.9 The Wilson Current Mirror

We will be making the following two assumptions. First, all transistors have the same current gain ß. Second, Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2`\ are matched, so their collector currents are equal. Therefore, I\ :sub:`C1` = I\ :sub:`C2` (= I\ :sub:`C`) and I\ :sub:`B1` = I\ :sub:`B2` (= I\ :sub:`B`) .

The base current of Q\ :sub:`3` is given by,

Looking at figure 11.9, it can be seen that :sub:`IE3` = I\ :sub:`C2` + I\ :sub:`B1` + I\ :sub:`B2` Substituting for I\ :sub:`C2`, I\ :sub:`B1` and I\ :sub:`B2`, I\ :sub:`E3` = I\ :sub:`C` + 2I\ :sub:`B`

so,

But, I\ :sub:`C1` = I\ :sub:`C2` = I\ :sub:`C`

Substituting for I\ :sub:`C` and since |image13| we get,

And finally,

And the output current (assuming the base-emitter voltage of all transistors to
be 0.7 V) is calculated as,

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/courses/electronics/text/chptr11-e16.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300

Note that the output current is equal to the input current I\ :sub:`R1` which in turn is dependent on V\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`1`. If V\ :sub:`1` is not stable, the output current will not be stable. Thus the circuit does not act as a regulated constant current source.

In order for it to work as a constant current source, R\ :sub:`1` must be replaced with a constant current source.

**Advantages over other configurations**

This circuit has the advantage of virtually eliminating the base current mismatch of the conventional BJT current mirror thereby ensuring that the output current I\ :sub:`C3` is almost equal to the reference or input current I\ :sub:`R1`. It also has a very high output impedance due to the negative feedback through Q\ :sub:`1` back to the base of Q\ :sub:`3`.

11.7.3 Further improvement (full Wilson Mirror)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a fourth transistor to the simple Wilson current mirror in figure 11.10, we have the modified or improved Wilson mirror. The improved input to output current accuracy is accomplished by equalizing the collector voltages of Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` at 1 V\ :sub:`BE`. This leaves the finite ß and voltage differences of each of Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` as the remaining unbalancing influences in the mirror.

11.8 Widlar current source
--------------------------

A Widlar current source is a modification of the basic two-transistor current
mirror that incorporates an emitter degeneration resistor for only the output
transistor, enabling the current source to generate low currents using only
moderate resistor values. This circuit is named for its inventor, Robert Widlar,
and was patented in 1967.

The Widlar circuit may be used with bipolar transistors or MOS transistors. An
example application is in the now famous uA741 operational amplifier, and Widlar
used the circuit in many of his designs.

   transistors.

Figure 11.11 is an example Widlar current source using bipolar transistors, where the emitter resistor R\ :sub:`2` is connected in series with the emitter of output transistor Q\ :sub:`2`, and has the effect of reducing the current in Q\ :sub:`2` relative to Q\ :sub:`1`. The key to this circuit is that the voltage drop across the resistor R\ :sub:`2` subtracts from the base-emitter voltage of transistor Q\ :sub:`2`, thereby reducing the collector current compared to transistor Q\ :sub:`1`. A simulation plot showing this reduction in I\ :sub:`C2` is presented in figure 11.12.

Where ß\ :sub:`2` is the beta of the output transistor, which may not be the same as that of the input transistor, in part because the currents in the two transistors are very different. The variable I\ :sub:`B2` is the base current of the output transistor, V\ :sub:`BE` refers to base-emitter voltage. If we neglect the effect of finite ß and use the V\ :sub:`BE` equation we can obtain a useful formula for the output current:

Suppose we want to create a 100uA output current from a 300uA input current as in the simulation plot of figure 11.12. V\ :sub:`T` is 26mV times ln(3) is 28.5mV. 28.5mV divided by 100uA is 285 ohms. This equation makes the approximation that the currents are both much larger than the saturation currents I\ :sub:`S1`, I\ :sub:`S2`, an approximation valid except for very low current levels. In the following the distinction between the two scale currents is dropped, although the difference can be important, for example, if the two transistors are designed with different emitter areas.

   Figure 11.13 Small-signal circuit for finding output resistance of the Widlar
   source shown in figure 11.11.

A test current I/:sub:`x` is applied at the output, and the output resistance is then R\ :sub:`O` = V\ :sub:`x` / I\ :sub:`x`.

An important property of a current source is its small signal incremental output impedance, which should ideally be infinite. The emitter degeneration resistance introduces local current feedback for transistor Q\ :sub:`2`. Any increase in the current in Q\ :sub:`2` increases the voltage drop across R\ :sub:`2`, reducing the V\ :sub:`BE` for Q\ :sub:`2`, thereby countering the increase in current. This feedback means the output impedance of the circuit is increased, because the feedback involving R\ :sub:`2` forces use of a larger voltage to drive a given current.

Output resistance is found using a small-signal model for the circuit, shown in Figure 11.13. The transistor Q\ :sub:`1` is replaced by its small-signal emitter resistance r\ :sub:`E` because it is diode connected. In a diode-connected transistor the collector is short-circuited to the base, so the transistor collector-base junction has no time-varying voltage across it. As a result, the transistor behaves like the base-emitter diode, which at low frequencies has a small-signal circuit that is simply the resistor r\ :sub:`E` = V\ :sub:`T` / I\ :sub:`E`, with I\ :sub:`E` the DC Q-point emitter current. The transistor Q\ :sub:`2` is replaced with its hybrid-pi model. A test current I\ :sub:`x` is attached at the output.

Using the figure, the output resistance is determined using Kirchhoff's laws. Using Kirchhoff's voltage law from the ground on the left to the ground connection of R\ :sub:`2`:

or, substituting for I\ :sub:`b`:

Eq. 4

|image16|\ |image17|

According to Eq. 4, the output resistance of the Widlar current source is increased over that of the output transistor itself (which is r\ :sub:`O`) so long as R\ :sub:`2` is large enough compared to the r\ :sub:`p` of the output transistor. (Large resistances R\ :sub:`2` make the factor multiplying r\ :sub:`O` approach the value (ß +1).) The output transistor carries a low current, making r\ :sub:`p` large, and increase in R\ :sub:`2` tends to reduce this current further, causing a correlated increase in r\ :sub:`p`. Therefore, a goal of R\ :sub:`2` >> r\ :sub:`p` can be unrealistic, and further discussion is provided below. The resistance R\ :sub:`1` / r\ :sub:`E` usually is small because the emitter resistance r\ :sub:`E` usually is only a few ohms.

11.9. The Zero Gain Amplifier
-----------------------------

When designing a circuit it is important to take into account the wide variation
in certain device values from one to another. A central objective of the
designer is to desensitize the circuit to these variations to produce a circuit
which meets the specifications across all possible conditions. One aspect of
design which is common to nearly all circuits is the establishment of stable
bias or operating point levels. This seemingly minor portion of a design can
provide the most challenging and interesting circuit problems. Many bias
generators are centered around the generation of currents to operate the core of
the circuit. Current generated from simple resistors and diodes or diode
connected transistors connected across the power supply will vary approximately
proportional to the variation of the supply voltage. This variation in the
resulting bias current is frequently undesirable.

This is to introduce another kind of current mirror, actually a stabilized
current source, which has an output which had been desensitized to variation in
input current. To understand this configuration, it is helpful to examine the
behavior of a zero gain amplifier. A NMOS version is shown in figure 11.14 but
PMOS, NPN or PNP transistors will just as well function in this configuration

   Figure 11.14 NMOS Zero Gain Amplifier

Remembering back to the previous explanation of the common emitter/source amplifier (figure 11.14(a)), the gain is a function of the drain (or collector) current and the load resistor. For a given drain current, if the drain resistor R\ :sub:`L` is set equal to r\ :sub:`s` then the gain A will be minus 1.

Alternatively. if the gate is held fixed at the same DC bias level which produces an identical drain current as in (a) and an input signal is applied to the top of load resistor R\ :sub:`L` (figure 11.14(b)), then the gain will be plus 1. That is if the drain/source output impedance of the transistor is neglected. If we now connect the gate to the top of resistor R\ :sub:`L` as in figure 11.14(c), the net gain superimposing both paths will be 1 - 1 = 0.

In figure 11.15 we have an NPN transistor biased into conduction with a collector voltage V\ :sub:`C` which is less than the base voltage V\ :sub:`BE` by the thermal voltage V\ :sub:`T`\ = kT/q, (equal to Ic times R\ :sub:`L`) and is essentially constant with input voltage changes applied from V\ :sub:`IN`. The voltages seen at V\ :sub:`BE` and V\ :sub:`C` are plotted vs. the applied voltage at V\ :sub:`IN` in figure 11.14. As we can see while V\ :sub:`BE` continues to rise, V\ :sub:`C` remains much more constant and actually decreases above a certain level of V\ :sub:`IN`.

A zero gain amplifier made using an enhancement mode NMOS 2N7000 transistor was
simulated where the small signal AC gain and phase was calculated as the drain
current was swept. As can be seen in figure 11.17 there is a sharp null or dip
in the gain curve at around 345uA. This also occurs at the point where the phase
makes a sharp transition from 0 degrees to 180 degrees.

11.10 Stabilized Current Source
-------------------------------

Now that we understand the concept of the zero gain amplifier, the objective is to investigate its use to produce an output current which is stabilized (less sensitive) to variations of the input current level. This current source configuration, figure 11.17, is also sometimes called a Peaking Current Source or g\ :sub:`m`-compensated mirror. Because the collector voltage V\ :sub:`C` of transistor Q\ :sub:`1` is now more constant with changes in the input supply voltage as represented by V\ :sub:`IN`, it can be used as the base voltage of Q\ :sub:`2` to produce a much more constant collector current in transistor Q\ :sub:`2`.
