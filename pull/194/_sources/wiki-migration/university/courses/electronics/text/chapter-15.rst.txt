Chapter 15. MOSFET Applications:
================================

In this chapter we will be exploring certain applications for MSOFET devices
other than as linear amplifier stages.

15.1 MOSFET as an analog switch
-------------------------------

Enhancement mode MOSFET based analog switches use the transistor channel as a
low resistance to pass analog signals when on, and as a high impedance when off.
Signals can flow in either direction across a MOSFET switch. In this application
the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the voltages of
each electrode compared to that of the gate and the direction of current flow.
For a simple MOSFET without an integrated diode from source to drain (or the
back gate or body terminal tied to the source), the source is the more negative
side for an NMOS or the more positive side for a PMOS. All of these switches are
limited as to what signals they can pass when on or block when off by their
gate-source, gate-drain and source-drain voltages, and source-to-drain currents;
exceeding these voltage or current limits will potentially damage the switch.

15.1.1 Single-type MOSFET switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This analog switch uses a four-terminal simple, generally enhancement mode, MOSFET of either P or N type. In the case of an N-type switch, the body or back gate terminal is connected to the most negative supply (usually GND in single power supply systems) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the gate voltage with respect to the source, the lower the resistance of the switch will be. An NMOS switch passes all voltages less than (V\ :sub:`gate`-V\ :sub:`tn`). When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or triode) region of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.

In the case of a PMOS, the body or back gate is connected to the most positive voltage, and the gate is brought to a lower potential to turn the switch on. The PMOS switch passes all voltages higher than (V\ :sub:`gate`\ +|V\ :sub:`tp`\ \|). Threshold voltage (V\ :sub:`tp`) is typically negative in the case of PMOS.

A PMOS switch will have about three times the resistance of an NMOS device of
equal dimensions because electrons have about three times the mobility of holes
in silicon.

15.1.2 Complementary (CMOS) type MOSFET switch, Transmission gate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This "complementary" or CMOS type of switch uses one PMOS and one NMOS FET to counteract the turn on limitations of the single-type switch. The FETs have their drains and sources connected in parallel, the body of the PMOS is connected to the high potential (V\ :sub:`DD`) and the body of the NMOS is connected to the low potential (GND). To turn the switch on the gate of the PMOS is driven to the low potential and the gate of the NMOS is driven to the high potential. For voltages between (V\ :sub:`DD`-V\ :sub:`tn`) and (GND+V\ :sub:`tp`) both FETs conduct the signal, for voltages less than (GND+V\ :sub:`tp`) the NMOS conducts alone and for voltages greater than (V\ :sub:`DD`-V\ :sub:`tn`) the PMOS conducts alone.

The only limits for this switch are the gate-source, gate-drain and source-drain
voltage limits for both FETs. Also, the PMOS is typically three times the width
of the NMOS so the switch on resistance will be balanced across the signal
voltage.

Tri-state circuitry used in digital logic or data buses sometimes incorporates a
CMOS MOSFET switch on its output to provide for a low ohmic, full range output
when on and a high ohmic, mid-level signal when off.

15.2 Chopper Stabilized (Auto-Zero) Precision Op Amps
-----------------------------------------------------

For the lowest offset and drift performance, chopper-stabilized ( or auto-zero )
amplifiers may be the best solution. The best bipolar amplifiers offer offset
voltages of 25 µV and 0.1 µV/ºC drift. Offset voltages less than 5 µV with
practically no measurable offset drift are obtainable by using chopper
stabilization techniques, albeit with some penalties.

15.2.1 Basic Chopper Amplifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A basic chopper amplifier circuit is shown in figure 15.2.1 below. This is a common example where the CMOS analog switch we just discussed in section 15.1 can be put to good use. When the switches are in the "Z" (auto-zero) position, capacitors C\ :sub:`2` and C\ :sub:`3` are charged to the amplifier input and output offset voltage, respectively. When the switches are in the "S" (sample) position, V\ :sub:`IN` is connected to V\ :sub:`OUT` through the path comprised of R\ :sub:`1`, R\ :sub:`2`, C\ :sub:`2`, the amplifier, C\ :sub:`3`, and R\ :sub:`3`. The frequency used to chop is usually between a few hundred Hz and several kHz, and it should be noted that because this is a sampling system, the input frequency must be much less than one-half the chopping frequency in order to prevent errors due to aliasing. The R\ :sub:`1`-C\ :sub:`1` combination serves as an antialiasing filter. It is also assumed that after a steady state condition is reached, there is only a minimal amount of charge transferred during the switching cycles. The output "hold" capacitor, C\ :sub:`4`, and the load, R\ :sub:`L`, must be chosen such that there is minimal V\ :sub:`OUT` droop during the auto-zero cycle.

15.2.2 Auto-Zero Chopper Stabilized OP AMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic chopper amplifier of figure 15.2.1 can pass only frequencies lower
than one half the chopping frequency because of the input filtering required to
prevent aliasing. In contrast to this, the chopper-stabilized architecture shown
in figure 15.2.2 is most often used in chopper op amp implementations.

|image6|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 15.2.2: Auto-Zero (Chopper-Stabilized) Op Amp

In this circuit, A\ :sub:`1` is the main amplifier, and A\ :sub:`2` is the nulling amplifier. Both amplifiers are considered identical and both have an additional Null input terminal. In the sample mode (switches in "S" position), the nulling amplifier, A\ :sub:`2`, monitors the input offset voltage of A\ :sub:`1` and drives its output to zero by applying a suitable correcting voltage at A\ :sub:`1`'s Null pin. Note, however, that A\ :sub:`2` also has an input offset voltage, so it must correct its own error before attempting to null A\ :sub:`1`'s offset. This is achieved in the auto-zero mode (switches in "Z" position) by momentarily disconnecting A\ :sub:`2` from A\ :sub:`1`, shorting its inputs together, and coupling its output to its own Null pin. During the auto-zero mode, the correction voltage for A\ :sub:`1` is momentarily held by C\ :sub:`1`. Similarly, C\ :sub:`2` holds the correction voltage for A\ :sub:`2` during the sample mode. In integrated IC chopper-stabilized op amps, both amplifiers and the storage capacitors C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2` are on a single chip.

Note in this architecture that the input signal is always connected to the output, through A\ :sub:`1`. The bandwidth of A\ :sub:`1` thus determines the overall signal bandwidth, and the input signal is not limited to less than one-half the chopping frequency as in the case of the traditional chopper amplifier architecture. However, the switching action does produce small transients at the chopping frequency, that can mix with the input signal frequency and produce intermodulation distortion.

15.2.3 Noise Considerations for Chopper Stabilized OP AMPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is interesting to consider the effects of a chopper amplifier on low
frequency 1/f noise. If the chopping frequency is considerably higher than the
1/f corner frequency of the input noise, the chopper-stabilized amplifier
continuously nulls out the 1/f noise on a sample-by-sample basis. Theoretically,
a chopper op amp therefore has no 1/f noise. However, the chopping action
produces wideband switching noise which is generally much worse than that of a
precision bipolar op amp and would need to be filtered out.

In order to take advantage of the chopper op amp's lack of 1/f noise, much
filtering is required, otherwise the total noise of a chopper will always be
worse than a good bipolar op amp. Chopper stabilized amplifiers should therefore
be used because of their low offset voltage and offset temperature drift, not
necessarily because of their lack of 1/f noise.

15.3 Switched Capacitor Circuits
--------------------------------

A switched capacitor is an electronic circuit element used in discrete time
signal processing systems. It works by transferring charge into and out of a
capacitor when switches are opened and closed. This is another example where the
CMOS analog switch discussed in section 15.1 is used almost exclusively.
Usually, non-overlapping signals are used to control the switches, often termed
Break before Make switching, so that all switches are open for a very short time
during the switching transitions. Discrete time filters implemented with these
elements are termed 'switched-capacitor filters'. Unlike continuous time analog
filters, which must be constructed with resistors, capacitors and sometimes
inductors whose values are accurately known, switched capacitor filters depend
only on the ratios between capacitances and the switching frequency. This makes
them much more suitable for use within integrated circuits, where the accurately
specified absolute value of components such as resistors and capacitors are not
economical to construct.

15.3.1 The switched capacitor resistor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic switched capacitor circuit as illustrated in figure 15.3.1, is the switched capacitor resistor. It consists of one capacitor C\ :sub:`1` and two switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`2` which connect the capacitor alternately to the input, V\ :sub:`IN` and the output, V\ :sub:`OUT`.

|image7|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 15.3.1, Basic Switched Capacitor Resistor

Each switching cycle transfers a charge ?q from the input to the output at the
switching frequency F. Recall that the charge q on a capacitor C with a voltage
V between the plates is given by:

:math:`q = CV`

Where V is the voltage across the capacitor. Therefore, when S\ :sub:`1` is closed while S\ :sub:`2` is open, the charge transferred from the input source to C is:

:math:`q_IN = C_1V_IN`

And when S\ :sub:`2` is closed while S\ :sub:`1` is open, the charge transferred from C\ :sub:`1` to the output is:

:math:`q_OUT = C_1 V_OUT`

The charge Δq transferred in each cycle is:

:math:`Δq = q_OUT - q_IN = C_1 ( V_OUT - V_IN )`

Since a charge ?q is transferred at a rate F, the rate of transfer of charge per
unit time is:

:math:`I = ΔqF`

Note that I is used, the symbol for electric current, for this quantity. This is
to demonstrate that a continuous transfer of charge from one node to another is
the same as current. Substituting for Δq in the equation above, we get:

:math:`I = C_1 ( V_OUT - V_IN ) F`

We define ΔV, the voltage across the circuit from input to output, as:

:math:`ΔV = V_OUT - V_IN`

We now have a relationship between I and V, which we can rearrange to give an
equivalent resistance R:

:math:`R = V / I = 1 / (C_1 F)`

Thus, the circuit behaves like a resistor whose value depends on C\ :sub:`1` and F.

The Switched Capacitor resistor is often used as a replacement for simple
resistors in integrated circuits because it is easier to fabricate reliably with
a wide range of values. It also has the benefit that the equivalent resistor
value can be adjusted by changing the switching frequency.

This same circuit can be used in discrete time systems (such as analog to
digital converters) as a track and hold circuit. During the appropriate clock
phase, the capacitor samples the analog voltage through switch one and in the
second phase presents this held sampled value to the next part of the electronic
system for further processing.

15.3.2 Example Switched Capacitor Low Pass Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can examine an example circuit using the Switched Capacitor as a resistor. By adding a second capacitor C\ :sub:`2` across the output of figure 15.3.1, we get the RC low pass circuit shown in figure 15.3.2.

|image8|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 15.3.2, Switched Capacitor RC low pass filter

From the previous section we get the equation for the equivalent resistor R:

:math:`R_eq = 1 / (C_1 F_clock)`

The 3 dB frequency response of a single pole RC low pass filter is:

:math:`F_3db = 1 / (2πR_eq C_2 )`

Substituting the switched capacitor resistor Req in to the frequency response we
get:

:math:`F_3db = ( C_1 F_clock ) / ( 2πC_2 )`

So we can see that the 3 dB frequency response is directly related to the clock frequency and the ratio of C\ :sub:`1` to C\ :sub:`2`.

The following two graphs plot the frequency response for the basic switched capacitor low pass filter from figure 15.3.2 with the value of C\ :sub:`1` equal to 100pF and with the value of C\ :sub:`2` equal to 4.7nF for a C\ :sub:`1` to C\ :sub:`2` ratio of 1 to 47. Figure 15.3.3 plots the amplitude vs. frequency response for F\ :sub:`clock` equal to 100 KHz, 200 KHz and 500 KHz. Figure 15.3.4 plots the phase vs. frequency for the same three clock frequencies.

   switching frequencies

   Figure 15.3.4 Filter output phase vs frequency plot for three different
   switching frequencies

Note that the amplitude curve for 200 KHz switching frequency crosses the -5 dB
line at exactly twice the input frequency as the 100 KHz curve. And that the 500
KHz curve crosses at a frequency 2.5 times the frequency of the 200 KHz curve.

15.3.3 Switched capacitor differencing circuit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A switched capacitor differential to single ended configuration is shown in figure 15.3.5. In this circuit capacitor C\ :sub:`1` is charged to the differential voltage applied to V\ :sub:`IN :math:`s`\ +\ :math:`s`` and V\ :sub:`IN :math:`s`-:math:`s`` during the first half of the clock cycle when switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`2` are closed as shown in the figure, to position 1. During the second half of the clock cycle switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`2` are moved to position 2 connecting capacitor C\ :sub:`1` in parallel with capacitor C\ :sub:`2`. One end of C\ :sub:`2` is connected to ground so that the voltage seen at V\ :sub:`OUT` is referenced to ground and will, in steady state, be equal to V\ :sub:`IN :math:`s`\ +\ :math:`s`` - V\ :sub:`IN :math:`s`-:math:`s``. The values of capacitors C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2` can in general be in any ratio but often they are equal or C\ :sub:`2` is sized to be larger than C\ :sub:`1` depending on the nature of the load the circuit might be required to drive at V\ :sub:`OUT`.

|image11|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 15.3.5 Differential input to single ended output circuit

The capacitor used to transfer the input voltage to the output in these circuits
is typically known as the "flying capacitor".

**Other Flying-Capacitor applications:**

In addition to the differential to single ended function we saw in figure
15.3.5, flying capacitor configurations can double the input voltage, triple the
voltage, halve the voltage, invert the voltage, fractionally multiply or scale
voltages such as x3/2, x4/3, x2/3, etc. and generate arbitrary voltages,
depending on the capacitor ratios and circuit topology. The following are
additional useful variations of the flying-capacitor circuit from figure 15.3.5.

The first is a voltage inverter where the output voltage V\ :sub:`OUT` is the negative of V\ :sub:`IN`, V\ :sub:`OUT` = -V\ :sub:`IN` shown in figure 15.3.6. Very similar to the first configuration but with what was V\ :sub:`IN :math:`s`-:math:`s`` now connected to ground and ground on the output side now connected to one terminal of S\ :sub:`1` and the now inverted output voltage taken at one terminal of S\ :sub:`2`.

|image12|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 15.3.6 Voltage inverter

The flying capacitor circuit can also be configured as a precession divide by 2 voltage divider as we see in figure 15.3.7. During the first half of the clock cycle, with switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`2` in position 1, the two capacitors, C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2`, are placed in series across V\ :sub:`IN`. If C\ :sub:`1` is exactly equal to C\ :sub:`2` then they will act as a voltage divider with V\ :sub:`OUT` equal to one half V\ :sub:`IN`. This assumes that there was no preexisting charge on either capacitor. During the second half of the clock cycle when S1 and S2 are in position 2, the two capacitors are connected in parallel. This will cause the voltage across both capacitors to be equal and thus redistribute any preexisting charge difference to redistribute equally between the two capacitors. After a few clock cycles the voltage across each capacitor will be equal to each other and equal to one half of V\ :sub:`IN`.

|image13|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 15.3.7 Divide V\ :sub:`IN` by 2 circuit

Similarly, the circuit in figure 15.3.7 can be configured as a precession multiply by 2 voltage multiplier as we see in figure 15.3.8. In this example, capacitor C\ :sub:`1` is charged to V\ :sub:`IN` during the first half clock cycle when switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`2` are in position 1. During the second half clock cycle when switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`2` are in position 2, the previously grounded end of C\ :sub:`1` is now connected to V\ :sub:`IN`. The other end of C\ :sub:`1` which was previously connected to V\ :sub:`IN` is now connected to V\ :sub:`OUT`. Now V\ :sub:`OUT` will be equal to V\ :sub:`IN` plus the V\ :sub:`IN` stored on capacitor C\ :sub:`1` or 2xV\ :sub:`IN`. Capacitor C\ :sub:`2` will take a few clock cycles to charge up to 2xV\ :sub:`IN` and will serve to store or hold the voltage at V\ :sub:`OUT` at 2xV\ :sub:`IN` while the switches are in position 1, sampling V\ :sub:`IN` onto C\ :sub:`1`.

|image14|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 15.3.8 voltage multiplier

So far in this section we have been assuming that V\ :sub:`IN` is some varying arbitrary signal which presumably carries some sort of information in a system. VIN could just as easily be a DC power supply voltage which we wish to scale up or down in voltage to be used elsewhere in the system. When used for this application flying capacitor circuits are often called DC/DC converters. Because we are trying to transfer power from V\ :sub:`IN` to V\ :sub:`OUT` in this application the MOS transistors are much larger to carry higher currents with low on resistance and the capacitors have much higher values to store more charge and deliver it to the load during the half of the clock cycle when charge is not being transferred from the input supply.

The basic concept of a capacitor based DC to DC power converter is shown below in figure 15.3.9. As we said these are often referred to as "flying capacitor" or "charge-pump" DC/DC converters. The operation alternates between the two configurations shown in figure 15.3.9 which is in effect two copies of the circuit we saw in figure 15.3.8. On the left, switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`5` are closed connecting C\ :sub:`1` between ground and V\ :sub:`IN`. On the right, switches S\ :sub:`4` and S\ :sub:`8` are closed connecting C\ :sub:`2` between V\ :sub:`IN` and V\ :sub:`OUT`. For the half cycle shown capacitor C\ :sub:`1` is charged to the voltage at V\ :sub:`IN` and V\ :sub:`OUT` is the sum of the voltage at V\ :sub:`IN` and the voltage on capacitor C\ :sub:`2`. For the second half cycle the switches are reversed. Now with S\ :sub:`2` and S\ :sub:`6` closed C\ :sub:`1` is connected between V\ :sub:`IN` and V\ :sub:`OUT`. Also switches S\ :sub:`3` and S\ :sub:`7` will now be closed connecting C\ :sub:`2` between ground and V\ :sub:`IN`. So now we can see that after a few cycles V\ :sub:`OUT`, the voltage across capacitor C\ :sub:`3` will be equal to twice V\ :sub:`IN`. As you can see the capacitors "fly" back and forth between V\ :sub:`IN` and V\ :sub:`OUT`, thus the name "flying capacitor". One can also see that what is in effect happening is the charge on capacitors C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2` is alternately transferred or pumped onto capacitor C\ :sub:`3` charging it up to two times V\ :sub:`IN`. This action gives rise to the second "charge pump" name.

   Figure 15.3.9 Capacitor based voltage doubler with ideal switches

We will now replace the ideal switches in the diagram with MOSFET switches. The next diagram figure 15.3.10, shows a direct substitution of NMOS ( S\ :sub:`1`,S\ :sub:`3`,S\ :sub:`5`,S\ :sub:`7` ) and PMOS ( S\ :sub:`2`,S\ :sub:`4`,S\ :sub:`6`,S\ :sub:`8` ) devices for the switches in the first diagram. It can be noted that switches S\ :sub:`1` and S\ :sub:`2` form a complementary pair and take the same form as a CMOS inverter logic gate. The other three sets of switches form similar complementary pairs.
