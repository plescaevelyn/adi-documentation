Activity: BJT Multivibrators, For ADALM2000
===========================================

Background:
-----------

A multivibrator circuit consists generally of two inverting amplifier stages. The two amplifiers are connected in series or cascade, and a feedback path connects from the output of the second amplifier back to the input of the first. Because each stages inverts the signal, the overall feedback around the loop is positive. There are three main types of multivibrators. In the astable multivibrator capacitors are used to couple the two amplifier stages and provide the feedback path. Since the capacitors block any DC signals (sometimes referred to as state) from passing from one stage to the next the astable multivibrator has no stable DC operating point and is thus a free-running oscillator. In the monostable multivibrator the coupling from one of the stages to the other uses one capacitor while the second connection is through a DC path. Thus the monostable multivibrator has one stable DC stage. Hence, monostable or as it is sometimes referred to as a one-shot. The circuit maintains this single stable state except when a triggering pulse is applied. Then the state changes for a predetermined length of time set by the RC time constant of the AC coupled part of the signal path. In the bistable multivibrator both coupling paths are DC coupled and thus the circuit has two different stable states and uses no capacitors. The bistable multivibrator is also called a flip-flop, with either of two DC stable states.

The Astable Multivibrator
=========================

Objectives:
-----------

The objective of this first experiment is to build an astable multivibrator. Two identical resistance-capacitance networks determine the frequency at which oscillation will occur. The amplifying devices (transistors) are connected in a common-emitter configuration, as shown in figure 1.

Materials:
----------

ADALM2000 Active Learning Module Solder-less breadboard Jumper wires 2 - 470 Ω Resistors 2 - 20 KΩ Resistors 2 - small signal NPN transistors (2N3904) 1 - Red LED 1 - Green LED 2 - 47 uF Capacitors

Directions:
-----------

Construct the circuit as shown in figure 1 on your solder-less breadboard. The green boxes indicate connections to the ADALM2000. Note: there is no input from the ADALM2000 board just the power supply. The first inverting amplifier stage consists of Q\ :sub:`1` with R\ :sub:`1` and the Red LED serving as the output load. The second inverting amplifier stage consists of Q\ :sub:`2` with R\ :sub:`2` and the Green LED serving as the load. C\ :sub:`1` couples the output of the first stage at the collector of Q\ :sub:`1` to the input of the second stage at the base of Q\ :sub:`2`. Similarly, C\ :sub:`2` couples the output of the second stage at the collector of Q\ :sub:`2` back to the input of the first stage at the base of Q\ :sub:`1`.

Procedure:
----------

The frequency of oscillation is very slow due to the large values of capacitors C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2`. Replace C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2` with 0.1uF capacitors. The circuit should oscillate much faster now such that both LEDs seem to be on at the same time. Using the scope channels you should now measure the frequency and period of the output waveforms.

The Monostable Multivibrator
============================

Objectives:
-----------

The objective of this second experiment is to build an monostable multivibrator. One resistance-capacitance network determines the duration of the one-shot output. The amplifying devices (transistors) are connected in a common-emitter configuration, as shown in figure 2.

D-Type Flip-Flop
----------------

Objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this fourth experiment is to use the bistable or set - reset flip-flop from experiment 3 to build what is known as a D-Type flip-flop.

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM2000 Active Learning Module Solder-less breadboard Jumper wires 3 - 1 KΩ resistors 1 - 100 KΩ resistor 2 - 200 KΩ resistors 2 - 47 KΩ resistors 3 - small signal NPN transistors (2N3904) 2 - small signal diodes (1N914) 2 - 39 pF capacitors 2 - 100 pF capacitors

Directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Construct the D type flip-flop circuit as shown in figure 4 on your solder-less breadboard. Note that the polarity of the two diodes is reversed compared to figure 3. Because this experiment will be done at much higher frequencies, the LEDs have been removed and simple 1 K? load resistors are used.

Switching between the two flip-flop states is achieved by applying the D (data) signal and a single clock pulse which, depending on the state of the D input with respect to the current state will, cause the "ON" transistor to turn "OFF" and the "OFF" transistor to turn "ON" on the negative or falling edge of the clock pulse. The true D signal and complement DB signal ( output of Q\ :sub:`3`, R\ :sub:`7` inverting stage ) are used to bias diodes D\ :sub:`1` and D\ :sub:`2` to steer the clock pulse to the correct base, the equivalent of the SET and RESET inputs in figure 3.

To illustrate how the circuit operates we will assume the circuit is in one of its two stable states with the QB output low ( collector voltage of Q\ :sub:`1` at 0 V ), and the Q output high ( collector voltage of Q\ :sub:`2` high at 5 V ). With the D input low ( DB high ) D\ :sub:`1` has a low voltage on its cathode via R\ :sub:`6` and a high voltage ( V\ :sub:`BE` of on transistor Q\ :sub:`1` ) on its anode via R\ :sub:`4`, making it forward biased. D\ :sub:`2` has a high voltage ( from DB ) on its cathode via R\ :sub:`5` and a low voltage on its anode via R\ :sub:`3` ( V\ :sub:`BE` of off transistor Q\ :sub:`2` ), making it reverse biased.

A negative going pulse on the Clock input, coupled through C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2`, is steered to the base of Q\ :sub:`1` since D\ :sub:`1` is forward biased, but blocked from the base of Q\ :sub:`2` by reverse biased D\ :sub:`2`. Q\ :sub:`1` is turned off and Q\ :sub:`2` is turned on by the cross coupled connection through the parallel combination of C\ :sub:`3` and R\ :sub:`3`. This happens very quickly because of the positive feedback effect we saw earlier in the simple bistable multivibrator. The circuit is now in the other stable state with the Q output high and the QB output low. The circuit will remain in that state until the D input becomes high and after another negative going clock pulse arrives.

   Figure 11 D type flip-flop


Hardware setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AWG1 output should be connected to the input marked Clock in figure 4. The AWG2 output should be connected to the D input. The first scope channel 1 input should also be connected to Clock input. The second input scope channel 2 should be connected to the Q output of the flip-flop in figure 4. Both the AWG1 and AWG2 should be configured as a square wave with a 5 V amplitude peak-to-peak and 2.5 V offset ( 0 - 5V swing ). Set the frequency of AWG1 to 10 KHz and set the frequency of AWG2 to 5 KHz. Set the phase of AWG2 to 45 degrees. Be sure to configure the two AWG outputs to operate synchronously.

   Figure 12 D type flip-flop breadboard circuit


Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

Turn on the Vp power supply and enable the AWG outputs only after you have completely built and checked the circuit. You should observe a square wave on the Q output which is aligned with the falling edge of the Clock input signal. Change the phase of AWG2 ( D input signal ) while observing this alignment. Does this change as the phase of the D input change? Move the channel 1 scope input to the D input. You should see a similar square wave signal but ahead in time with respect to the Q output. In other words the Q output is delayed until the falling edge of the Clock signal.

Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~

What is the purpose of capacitors C\ :sub:`3` and C\ :sub:`4`?

What if the highest clock frequency at which the circuit continues to function? What limits this maximum frequency?

The capacitor coupling ( AC coupling ) of the clock input relies on the rise and fall time ( dV/dT ) of the input pulse to switch the state of the flip-flop. Use the trapezoidal waveform option for AWG 1 and use the symmetry control to adjust the rise/fall time of the waveform. What is the slowest dV/dT that will change the state of the flip-flop?

Divide by 2 Flip-Flop
---------------------

Objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this fifth experiment is to modify the D-type flip-flop from experiment 4 to build a circuit that divides the frequency of an input signal by 2.

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM2000 Active Learning Module Solder-less breadboard Jumper wires 2 - 1 KΩ resistors 2 - 200 KΩ resistors 2 - 47 KΩ resistors 2 - small signal NPN transistors (2N3904) 2 - small signal diodes (1N914) 2 - 39 pF capacitors 2 - 100 pF capacitors

Directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify the D-type flip-flop from experiment four to construct the divide by 2 circuit as shown in figure 5 on your solder-less breadboard.

Switching between the two states is achieved by applying a single clock pulse which in turn will cause the "ON" transistor to turn "OFF" and the "OFF" transistor to turn "ON" on the negative or falling edge of the clock pulse. The circuit will switch sequentially by applying a pulse to each base in turn and this is achieved from a single input clock pulse using biasing the two diodes to steer the pulse to the correct base based on the current state of the flip-flop.

To illustrate how the circuit operates we will assume the circuit is in one of its two stable states with the collector voltage of Q\ :sub:`1` low (0 V), and that of Q\ :sub:`2` high (5 V). D\ :sub:`1` has a low voltage on its cathode via R\ :sub:`6` and a high voltage ( V\ :sub:`BE` of on transistor Q\ :sub:`1` ) on its anode via R\ :sub:`4`, making it forward biased. D\ :sub:`2` has a high voltage on its cathode via R\ :sub:`5` and a low voltage on its anode via R\ :sub:`3` ( V\ :sub:`BE` of off transistor Q\ :sub:`2` ), making it reverse biased.

An external negative going pulse, coupled through C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2`, is steered to the base of Q\ :sub:`1` since D\ :sub:`1` is forward biased, but blocked from the base of Q\ :sub:`2` by reverse biased D\ :sub:`2`. Q\ :sub:`1` is turned off and Q\ :sub:`2` is turned on by the cross coupled connection through the parallel combination of C\ :sub:`3` and R\ :sub:`3`. This happens very quickly because of the positive feedback effect we saw earlier in the simple bistable multivibrator. The circuit is now in its second stable state and waits for another negative going clock pulse.

Since the collector voltage of Q\ :sub:`2` , the Q output node, changes state for every clock pulse, there is one pulse appearing at the output for every two clock input pulses. It can therefore be used as a divide by two circuit.

The second input scope channel 2 should be connected to the Q output of the flip-flop in figure 5.
