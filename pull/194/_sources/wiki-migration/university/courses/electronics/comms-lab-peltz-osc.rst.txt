Activity: Peltz Oscillator
==========================

Objective:
----------

The objective of this lab activity is to investigate the characteristics of the
Peltz oscillator configuration.

Background:
-----------

Unlike the Clapp, Colpitts and Hartley oscillators which have a single transistor, the Peltz configuration uses two transistors. Looking at figure 1, we see that transistor Q\ :sub:`1` is configured as a common base amplifier stage. The resonate tank consisting of L\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`1` provides the collector load. Its output at the collector feeds the base of transistor Q\ :sub:`2` which is configured as an emitter follower (common collector) stage. The positive feedback which is required for oscillation is formed when the output of the emitter follower ( emitter Q\ :sub:`2` ) is connected back to the input of the common base stage at the emitter of Q\ :sub:`1`. The voltage gain of the common base amplifier stage is a maximum at the parallel resonate frequency of the LC tank where its impedance approaches infinty. The gain of the emitter follower is always slightly less than one. The combined gain around the loop will be much greater than 1 at resonance to sustaine oscillation.

The peak to peak swing across the LC tank is limited in this oscillator configuration. As the voltage on the base of Q\ :sub:`2` swings more positive than ground, the collector of Q\ :sub:`2`, the collector base junction will forward bias limiting the maximum positive swing to around one forward diode drop. Similarly, for the peak negative swing, when the collector of Q\ :sub:`1` swings negative enough to forward bias the collector base junction of Q\ :sub:`1`. When the collector base junction of a BJT transistor is forward biased the base current increases dramatically. We can make use of this increased base current to increase the peak to peak swing seen across the LC tank. If we insert resistors in series with the base of both Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2`, as shown in figure 2, the additional current through the resistors will lower the base voltage of Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` at the extremes of the LC tank voltage.

Pre Lab Simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build a simulation schematic of the Peltz oscillator as shown in figures 1 and 2. Calculate a value for bias resistor R\ :sub:`1` such the collector current in transistors Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` is greater than 200 uA each. Assume the circuit is powered from a -5V power supply. Calculate a values for C\ :sub:`1` and L\ :sub:`1` such that the resonate frequency will be at least 1 MHz. Perform a transient simulation. The peak to peak output swing across the LC tank should be limited to less than +/- 1 forward diode drop ( ~ +/-0.6 V ). Calculate and simulate values for R\ :sub:`2` = R\ :sub:`3` such that the output swing increases to at least +/- 1.25V. Save these results to compare with the measurements you take on the actual circuit and to include with your lab report.

Procedure:
----------

Turn on the -5V power supply. Observe the output waveform across the LC tank on scope channel 1. You can also observe the waveform seen at the emitters of Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` using scope channel 2.

Notice that the output signal swings positive and negative around ground (0 V). Measure the frequency of the output waveform. Measure the peak to peak amplitude R\ :sub:`2` and R\ :sub:`3` replaced with shorts (i.e. 0 Ω). Compare this to the peak to peak amplitude you measure with R\ :sub:`2` and R\ :sub:`3` in the circuit. Try other values for R\ :sub:`2` and R\ :sub:`3`. Is there a practical upper limit to the values of R\ :sub:`2` and R\ :sub:`3` and the peak to peak amplitude? Does changing the value of R\ :sub:`2` and R\ :sub:`3` effect the oscillating frequency? If so why?

Compare the shape of the output waveform with R\ :sub:`2` and R\ :sub:`3` as shorts vs with them set to various values. How does the shape change and why?
