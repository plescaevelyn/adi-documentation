Activity: The BJT connected as a diode
======================================

Objective:
----------

The purpose of this activity is to investigate the forward and reverse current
vs. voltage characteristics of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) connected as
a diode.

Materials:
----------

ADALM2000 Active Learning Module Solder-less Breadboard 1 - 1KΩ Resistor (or any
similar value) 1 - small signal NPN transistor (2N3904)

Directions:
-----------

The current vs. voltage characteristics of the base-emitter junction of an NPN transistor can be measured using the ADALM2000 Lab hardware and the following connections. Set up the breadboard with waveform generator, W1, attached to one end of resistor R\ :sub:`1`. Also connect scope input 2+ here. Connect the base and collector of Q\ :sub:`1` to the opposite end of R\ :sub:`1` as shown in the diagram. The emitter of Q\ :sub:`1` is connected to ground. Connect scope input 2- and scope input 1+ to the base - collector node of Q\ :sub:`1`. (Scope input 1- can be optionally grounded as well).

Hardware Setup:
---------------

The waveform generator should be configured for a 100 Hz triangle wave with 6
volt amplitude peak-to-peak and 0 offset. The differential scope channel 2 (2+,
2-) measures the current in the resistor (and in the transistor). Scope channel
1 (1+) is connected to measure the voltage across the diode connected
transistor. The current flowing through the transistor, is the voltage
difference 2+ and 2- (which is the channel 2 voltage) divided by the resistor
value (1KΩ).

Procedure:
----------

Load the captured data in to a spreadsheet program like Excel and calculate the current. Plot the current vs. the voltage across the transistor (V\ :sub:`BE`). No current flows in the reverse direction. In the forward conduction region, the voltage, current relationship is logarithmic. If the current is plotted on a log scale the line should be straight.

Questions:
----------

Derive the mathematical expression for the current, I\ :sub:`C`, given the voltage across the transistor V\ :sub:`BE`?

Reverse Breakdown Characteristics
=================================

Objective:
----------

The purpose of this activity is to investigate the reverse break down voltage
characteristics of the emitter base junction of a bipolar junction transistor
(BJT) connected as a diode.

Materials:
----------

1 - 100Ω Resistor 1 - small signal PNP transistor (2N3906)

Directions:
-----------

Set up the breadboard with the waveform generator output attached to one end of the series connected resistor 100Ω R\ :sub:`1` and base and collector of Q\ :sub:`1` as shown in figure 2. The emitter is connected to the negative 5 Volt fixed power supply. Scope channel 1 (1+) is connected to the base - collector node while 1- is connected to the emitter node. Scope channel 2 measures the voltage across R\ :sub:`1` and thus the current through Q\ :sub:`1`. The PNP 2N3906 is chosen over the NPN 2N3904 because the PNP emitter base breakdown voltage is less than the +10 V max that can be generated using ADALM2000 while the NPN's is likely to be higher than 10 V.

Hardware Setup:
---------------

The waveform generator should be configured for a 100 Hz triangle wave with 10 volt amplitude peak-to-peak and 0 volt offset. Scope channel 1 (1+) is used to measure the voltage across the transistor. The setup should be configured with channel 2 connected across resistor R\ :sub:`1` (2+, 2-). Both channels should be set to 1 V per division. The current flowing through the transistor is the voltage difference between 2+ and 2- divided by the resistor value (100Ω).

   Figure 6 PNP Emitter breadboard circuit

Procedure:
----------

The Lab hardware power supplies limits the maximum voltage available to less
than 10 volts. The emitter base reverse breakdown voltage of many transistors is
larger than this. In the configuration shown voltages between 0 volts and 10
volts ( W1 peak to peak swing ) can be measured.

   Figure 7 PNP Emitter waveform

Capture the scope waveforms and export them into a spreadsheet program such as
Excel. For the 2N3906 PNP used in the example, the breakdown voltage of the
emitter base junction is around 8.5 volts.

Questions:
----------

Disconnect the collector of Q\ :sub:`1`\ and leave it open. How does this change the breakdown voltage? Now connect the collector to the emitter. How does this change the breakdown voltage?

Try measuring the NPN 2N3904 emitter base reverse breakdown voltage. You can
also check the emitter base breakdown voltage for the two power transistors,
TIP31 and TIP32, which are included in the ADALP2000 Analog Parts Kit. Are they
higher or lower than the PNP 2N3906 and is it lower than the +10 volts you can
measure with this setup? If it is higher what could you add to the setup to
allow you to measure higher breakdown voltages?

Lowering the effective forward voltage of the diode
===================================================

VBE Multiplier Circuit
======================

Objective:
----------

Resistors R\ :sub:`2`, R\ :sub:`3` and R\ :sub:`4` form a voltage divider with the wiper of potentiometer R\ :sub:`3` connected to the base of Q\ :sub:`1`. The collector of Q\ :sub:`1` is connected to the second end of R\ :sub:`1` and the top of the voltage divider at R\ :sub:`2`. Scope channel 2 (2+) is connected to the collector of Q\ :sub:`1`.

Hardware Setup:
---------------

The waveform generator should be configured for a 100 Hz triangle wave with 4 volt amplitude peak-to-peak and 2V offset. The Single ended input of scope channel 2+ is used to measure the voltage across the transistor. The setup should be configured with channel 1+ connected to display the output of generator W1 and channel 2+ connected to display the collector voltage of Q\ :sub:`1`. The current flowing through the transistor, is the voltage difference between the W1 measured by scope input 1+ and scope input 2+ divided by the resistor value (1KΩ).

Procedure:
----------

Starting with the potentiometer R\ :sub:`3` set at the middle of its range the voltage at the collector of Q\ :sub:`2` should be about 2 times V\ :sub:`BE`. With R\ :sub:`3` set to its minimum the voltage at the collector should be 9/2 (or 4.5) times V\ :sub:`BE`. With R\ :sub:`3` set to its maximum the voltage at the collector should be 9/7 times V\ :sub:`BE`.

Questions:
----------

How does the voltage vs current characteristics of this V\ :sub:`BE` multiplier compare to those of a simple diode connected transistor?

Aside from the position of the pot wiper, do the values of R\ :sub:`2`, R\ :sub:`3` and R\ :sub:`4` effect the shape of the I vs V curve? To arrive at an answer try using values much larger and much smaller than those listed above.
