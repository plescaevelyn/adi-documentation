Activity: The Colpitts Oscillator
=================================

Objective:
----------

Oscillators come in many forms. In this lab activity we will explore the
Colpitts configuration which uses a taped capacitor divider to provide the
feedback path.

Background:
-----------

The Colpitts Oscillator is a particularly good circuit for producing fairly low distortion sine wave signals in the RF range, 30kHz to 30MHz. The Colpitts configuration can be recognized by its use of a tapped capacitor divider (C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2` in figure 1). The frequency of oscillation can be calculated in the same way as any parallel resonant circuit, using:

The values of the two capacitors (connected in series) are chosen so their total capacitance in series(C\ :sub:`TOT`), is given by:

Figure 1 shows a typical Colpitts oscillator. The frequency determining parallel resonant tuned circuit is formed by C\ :sub:`1`, C\ :sub:`2` and L\ :sub:`1` and is used as the collector load impedance of the common base amplifier Q\ :sub:`1`. This gives the amplifier a high gain only at the resonant frequency. This configuration of the Colpitts oscillator uses a common base amplifier, the base of Q\ :sub:`1`\ is biased to an appropriate DC level by resistor divider R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` but is connected directly to an AC ground by C\ :sub:`3`. In the common base mode the output voltage waveform at the collector, and the input signal at the emitter are in phase. This ensures that the fraction of the output signal from the node between C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2`, fed back from the tuned collector load to the emitter provides the required positive feedback. Note that this feedback is AC only and there is no DC path from the collector to the emitter.

The combined capacitance of C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2` also forms a low frequency time constant with the emitter resistor R\ :sub:`3` to provide an average DC voltage level proportional to the amplitude of the feedback signal at the emitter of Q\ :sub:`1`. This provides automatic control of the gain of the amplifier to regulate the closed loop gain of the oscillator. As with all oscillators, the Barkhausen criteria must be adhered to requiring a total gain of one and a phase shift of zero degrees from input to output. The emitter resistor R\ :sub:`3` is not decoupled because the emitter node is used as the common base amplifier input. The base is connected to AC ground by C\ :sub:`3`, which will provide a very low reactance at the oscillator frequency.

Pre Lab Simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build a simulation schematic of the Colpitts oscillator as shown in figure 1. Calculate values for bias resistors R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` such that with emitter resistor R\ :sub:`3`\ set to 1 KΩ, the collector current in NPN transistor Q\ :sub:`1` is approximately 1 mA. Assume the circuit is powered from a +10V power supply. Be sure to keep the sum of R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` ( total resistance greater than 10 KΩ) as high as practical to keep the standing current in the resistor divider as low as practical. Remember that C\ :sub:`3` provides an AC ground at the base of Q\ :sub:`1`. Set base decoupling capacitor C\ :sub:`3` and output AC coupling capacitor C\ :sub:`4` to 0.1uF. Calculate a values for C\ :sub:`1` and C\ :sub:`2` such that the resonate frequency, with L\ :sub:`1` set equal to 100 uH will be close to 500 KHz. Perform a transient simulation. Save these results to compare with the measurements you take on the actual circuit and to include with your lab report.

Directions:
-----------

Build the Colpitts Oscillator shown in figure 2 using your solder-less breadboard. Pick standard values from your parts kit for bias resistors R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` such that with emitter resistor R\ :sub:`3`\ set to 1 KΩ, the collector current in NPN transistor Q\ :sub:`1` is approximately 1 mA. The frequency of the oscillator can be from around 500 KHz to 2 MHz depending on the values chosen for C\ :sub:`1`, C\ :sub:`2` and L\ :sub:`1`. Start with L\ :sub:`1` = 100 uH and C\ :sub:`1` = 4.7 nF and C\ :sub:`2` = 1 nF. This oscillator circuit can produce a sine wave output in excess of 10 Vpp at an approximate frequency set by the value chosen for L\ :sub:`1`.

The green squares indicate where to connect the ADALM2000module AWG, scope
channels and power supplies. Be sure to only turn on the power supplies after
you double check your wiring.

Procedure:
----------

Having finished construction the Colpitts oscillator check that the circuit is oscillating correctly by turning on both the + and - 5 V power supplies and connecting one of the oscilloscope channels to the output terminal. It may be found that the value of R\ :sub:`3` is fairly critical, producing either a large distorted waveform or an intermittent low or no output. To find the best value for R\ :sub:`3`, it could be replaced by a 1 KΩ or 5 KΩ potentiometer for experimentation to find the value that gives the best wave shape and reliable amplitude. The optimal value for R\ :sub:`3` may change depending on the resonate frequency.

A plot example using R\ :sub:`1`\ =10KΩ, R\ :sub:`2`\ =1KΩ, C\ :sub:`1`\ =4.7nF, C\ :sub:`2`\ =1nF is presented in Figure 4.

Questions:
----------

Measure the peak to peak output voltage of the output. Measure the DC ( average ) level of the output waveform at the collector of Q\ :sub:`1` and on the other (output) side of AC coupling capacitor C\ :sub:`4`. Measure the period (time T) of the output waveform and its frequency (1/T). Compare this measured frequency to what you calculated by: :math:`F_R = 1 / 2 \pi sqrt(LC)` .

Fill in the table below with the measured frequency for other L\ :sub:`1` values. Use the values in the table as suggested options but try to include as many different values as possible using series and parallel combinations of the inductors supplied in your parts kit. For example a 20 uH inductor value can be made from two 10 uH inductors in series and likewise a 50 uH value can be obtained by connecting two 100 uH inductors in parallel. Any of the L\ :sub:`1` optional values shown below should give reliable oscillation.
