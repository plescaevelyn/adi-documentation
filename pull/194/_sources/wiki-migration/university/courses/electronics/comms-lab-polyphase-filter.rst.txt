Activity: Polyphase Filter Circuits
===================================

Objective:
----------

The objective of this lab activity is to examine polyphase filter circuits as a
quadrature generation technique and to extend the differential tuned amplifier
to create a polyphase amplifier or filter that can produce all four quadrature (
90º increments ) phases of an input signal source.

Background:
-----------

The use of quadrature frequency conversion is common in modern wireless
transceiver architectures, because both amplitude modulation and phase
modulation are deployed in today's digital communication systems.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation

Figure 1 shows a simplified first order polyphase circuit, as implemented in
many quadrature demodulators such as the ADL5380. This simple polyphase circuit
consists of complementary RC subcircuits. A low-pass transfer function from the
input to one output shifts the phase by -45º at the corner frequency, and a
high-pass transfer function to the other output shifts the phase by +45º at the
corner frequency. The net phase difference between the two outputs will be 90º.
If the R and C values of the two paths are matched, then both paths have the
same corner frequency and, more importantly, the phase of one output tracks the
other with a 90° phase shift for all frequencies. The relative amplitudes of the
two output signals, ( LO I 0º and LO Q 90º ) will be only equal at the -3dB
corner frequency of the two RC paths.

Generation of quadrature local oscillator (LO) signals is an important
functional block in sideband rejection heterodyne receivers. Quadrature
accuracy, that is the phase accuracy of the in phase and quadrature 90º
phase-shifted signals, directly determines the image reject ratio (IRR), an
important specification determining the sensitivity of a receiver.

Open the Network Analyzer software tool in Scopy. Configure the frequency sweep
to start at 10 KHz and stop at 30 MHz. Set the amplitude to 2 V and the offset
to zero. Check the box "Use Channel 1 as reference" under the scope channels
drop down menu to measure the phase of one output path with respect to the
other.

Differential Polyphase Tuned Amplifier
--------------------------------------

By adding second order L-C and C-L low and high pass filter sections as
differential output loads in a NPN differential amplifier we can generate all
four 90º phases ( i.e. 0º, 90º, 180º and 270º ) of an input sine wave signal.
Such a tuned amplifier is shown in figure 5.

~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM2000 Active Learning Module Solder-less breadboard, and jumper wire kit 1 - SSM2212 NPN matched transistor pair ( Q\ :sub:`1`, Q\ :sub:`2` ) 2 - 2N3904 NPN transistors ( Q\ :sub:`3`, Q\ :sub:`4` ) 2 - 100 uH inductor (Various other value inductors) 2 - 1 nF capacitors ( marked 102 ) 2 - 0.1 uF capacitors ( marked 104 ) 2 - 10 Ω resistors 2 - 150 Ω resistors 2 - 470 Ω resistors 3 - 1 KΩ resistors 1 - 10 KΩ resistor Other resistor and capacitors as needed

Directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the circuit shown in figure 5 on your solder-less breadboard. Use the SSM2212 matched transistor pair for Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2`. Transistors Q\ :sub:`3` and Q\ :sub:`4` can be 2N3904 devices. Set L\ :sub:`1` = L\ :sub:`2` = 100 uH and C\ :sub:`1` = C\ :sub:`2` = 1nF. R\ :sub:`1` should be equal to R\ :sub:`2` and use 470 Ω for their value. Likewise, R\ :sub:`3` should be equal to R\ :sub:`4` and use 150 Ω for their value.

channels and power supplies. Be sure to turn on the power supplies only after
you double check your wiring.

Open the voltage supply control window to turn on and off the fixed +5 and -5
volt power supplies. Open the Network Analyzer software tool in Scopy. Configure
the frequency sweep to start at 100 Hz and stop at 30 MHz. Set the amplitude to
1V and the offset to zero.

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

Calculate the expected LC corner frequency based on the L and C values used.

Turn on the power supplies. Connect scope input channel 2 through an AC coupling capacitor ( C\ :sub:`4` in figure 3 ) alternately to each of the four possible outputs at the ends of resistors R\ :sub:`1`, R\ :sub:`2`, R\ :sub:`3` and R\ :sub:`4`. Run a single frequency sweep and store each sweep in a waveform snapshot to compare each output's relative gain and phase response. Be sure to export all the frequency sweep data to a .csv file for further analysis in either Excel or Matlab.

Using the scope and function generator software instruments ( in the time domain
) set the AWG frequency to the resonate frequency with the amplitude set to 1V
peak-to-peak. Trigger on scope channel 1. Observe the relative amplitudes and
phases of the four outputs and store each waveform on channel 2 as a reference
channel to compare the amplitude and phase of each output.
