Lab Activity: Generating sine waves from triangle waves
=======================================================

Objective:
----------

The circuit we are evaluating in this lab activity generates an approximate sine
wave from a triangle wave by using the properties of the differential pair of
transistors contained in the SSM2212 NPN matched transistor pair. We know that
the transconductance of a differential pair of transistors is defined as:

   :align: center
   :width: 250

Where I\ :sub:`o` is the differential pair tail current, V\ :sub:`in` is the differential input voltage, and V\ :sub:`T` is the thermal voltage which is about 26 mV at room temperature.

Materials:
----------

ADALM2000 Active Learning Module Solder-less breadboard Jumper wires 1 - 10 KΩ
resistor 4 - 4.7 KΩ resistors 1 - 2.2 KΩ resistor 2 - 220 Ω resistors 1 - 390 Ω
resistor 1 - 500 Ω potentiometer 1 - 100 pF capacitor 2 - Small signal NPN
transistors (SSM2212 NPN matched pair) 1 - Opamp (OP27 )

Description:
------------

Construct the circuit in figure 1 on your solder-less breadboard. The +5 V ( pin
7 ) and -5 V ( pin 4 ) power supply connections for the OP27 amplifier were left
off of the schematic but remember to connect them or the circuit will not
function.

Procedure:
----------

Set the AWG 1 to the Following:

-  Amplitude (peak-to-peak) = 3.6V
-  Offset = 0V
-  Frequency = 1KHz
-  Triangle wave

Adjust the 500 Ω potentiometer, R\ :sub:`6`, for the best symmetry in the output sine wave shape. Using the FFT display and looking for the minimum even order distortion may be a good way to test the quality of the output sine wave. You may want to adjust the amplitude and DC offset of the input triangle wave to see if that can improve the odd order harmonics in the output.

In the case of this circuit, the output voltage will be approximately:

Where RL is the 4.7 KΩ load resistors on the output. The division by 2 happens
because we only taking a single ended output, not a differential output.

So the output voltage will be a function of the input voltage and the hyperbolic
tangent. The first few terms of the Taylor series of the sine and hyperbolic
tangent functions are:

Comparing the two Taylor series will see that they are both linear to first order. What this means is that if we apply a triangle wave to a differential pair with a hyperbolic tangent transfer function, and keep the amplitude low, that is on the order of 2V\ :sub:`T`, what you get out should be nearly indistinguishable from a sine wave. The purpose of the 2.2 kΩ resistor and the 220 Ω resistor at the input of the differential pair (base of Q\ :sub:`1`) is to attenuate the triangle wave signal from the AWG to operate the circuit in the range where the output is as low a distortion sine wave as possible.

Triangle Wave Generator
-----------------------

To make a stand-alone sine wave generator we need to replace the ADALM2000
module AWG with a triangle wave generator. The AD654 voltage-to-frequency
converter IC will be the basis of the triangle wave generator. The normal output
of the AD654 is an open collector digital square wave signal. The internal
timing circuit of the AD654 however uses a ramp generator and this internal ramp
waveform is available in differential form across the external timing capacitor
connected to pins 6 and 7 in figure 2. We cannot use this triangle wave signal
directly without disturbing the internal timing of the AD654. We can use the
AD8226 instrumentation amplifier to buffer and convert the differential signal
to a single ended signal. By adjusting the amplitude of this triangle wave
signal, we can use it to drive the triangle wave to sine wave converter circuit
from figure 1.

Materials:
----------

2 - 1 KΩ resistors 1 - 47 KΩ resistor 1 - 6.8 KΩ resistor 1 - 220 Ω resistor 1 -
5 KΩ potentiometer 1 - 0.1 uF capacitor 1 - 1 uF capacitor 1 - Red LED 1 - AD654
V-to-F converter 1 - AD8226 IN-AMP 1 - Small signal NPN transistor (2N3904)

When connecting the triangle wave output from the AD8226 to the input of the triangle to sine converter, replace the 2.2 KΩ fixed resistor R\ :sub:`1` with a 5 KΩ potentiometer to adjust the signal amplitude for optimal sine wave shape.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Connect the circuit shown in figure 4 to a breadboard.

With the use of M2K, the output s shown below. We can adjust the gain resistor
of the in-amp (R16) so that the output of the circuit will be in the range
instrumentation amplifier supply. In the Scopy plot below, R16 is at 168kΩ.
