Activity: Variable Gain Amplifiers
==================================

Objective
---------

In this laboratory we continue our discussion on operational amplifiers (see the previous lab here: :doc:`Activity 1. Simple Op Amps </wiki-migration/university/courses/electronics/electronics-lab-1>`) focusing on variable gain / voltage-controlled amplifiers.

Most operational amplifier or op-amp circuits have a fixed level of gain. However it is often useful to be able to vary the gain. This can be done simply by using a potentiometer on the output of a fixed gain op-amp circuit, but sometimes it may be more useful to vary the actual gain of the amplifier circuit itself.

A variable-gain or voltage-controlled amplifier is an electronic amplifier that varies its gain depending on a control voltage. This type of circuit has many applications, including audio level compression, synthesizers and amplitude modulation. It can be realized by first creating a voltage-controlled resistor, which is used to set the amplifier gain. The voltage-controlled resistor is one of the numerous interesting circuit elements that can be produced by using a transistor with simple biasing. Another approach is to use potentiometers to vary the value of the resistors that set the gain of the amplifier.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Use the first waveform generator as source Vin to provide a 2V amplitude peak-to-peak, 1 kHz sine wave excitation to the circuit. Use the second waveform generator for controlling the transistor, providing a 2V amplitude, 1Hz square wave excitation. Supply the op amp to +/- 5V from the power supply. Configure the scope so that the input signal is displayed on channel 1 and the output signal is displayed on channel 2.

An animated plot is presented in Figure 3.
