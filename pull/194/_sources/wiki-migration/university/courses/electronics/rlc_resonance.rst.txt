Activity: Resonance in RLC Circuits - ADALM2000
===============================================

Objective:
----------

The objective of this Lab activity is to study the phenomenon of resonance in
RLC circuits. Determine the resonant frequency and bandwidth of the given
network using the amplitude response to a sinusoidal source.

Background:
-----------

A resonant circuit, also called a tuned circuit consists of an inductor and a
capacitor together with a voltage or current source. It is one of the most
important circuits used in electronics. For example, a resonant circuit, in one
of many forms, allows us to tune into a desired radio or television station from
the vast number of signals that are around us at any time.

A network is in resonance when the voltage and current at the network input
terminals are in phase and the input impedance of the network is purely
resistive.

   Figure 1: Parallel RLC Circuit

Consider the Parallel RLC circuit of figure 1. The steady-state admittance
offered by the circuit is:

:math:`Y = 1/R + j(\omega C - 1/(\omega L) )`

Resonance occurs when the voltage and current at the input terminals are in
phase. This corresponds to a purely real admittance, so that the necessary
condition is given by:

:math:`\omega C - 1/\omega L = 0`

The resonant condition may be achieved by adjusting L, C, or ω. Keeping L and C constant, the resonant frequency ω\ :sub:`o` is given by:

$omega_o = 1/sqrtLC $ rad/s (1)

OR

:math:`f_o = 1/(2pi sqrtLC)` Hertz (2)

Frequency Response: It is a plot of the magnitude of the output Voltage of a
resonance circuit as function of frequency. The response of course starts at
zero, reaches a maximum value in the vicinity of the natural resonant frequency,
and then drops again to zero as ω becomes infinite. The frequency response is
shown in figure 2.

The two additional frequencies ω\ :sub:`1` and ω\ :sub:`2` are also indicated which are called half-power frequencies. These frequencies locate those points on the curve at which the voltage response is 1/sqrt(2) or 0.707 times the maximum value. They are used to measure the band-width of the response curve. This is called the half-power bandwidth of the resonant circuit and is defined as:

:math:`ß = omega_2 - omega_1` (3)

Procedure:
----------

Using the Network analyzer tool you can plot the frequency response of a
resonant circuit. Start by computing the resonance frequency using equation (1).
According to this, set the logarithmic sweep parameters. In this case, the
resonance frequency is 1.1kHz so the sweep can start from 100Hz to 10 kHz. Set
the minimum phase at -90 the maximum phase at 90. Magnitude axis can be set from
-15 dB to 0dB. In Figure 6 is presented the transfer function of the RLC circuit
obtained by running the network analyzer.

The circuit response in time domain can be analyzed using Signal generator and
Oscilloscope tools. On the signal generator channel 1 select a sine waveform of
2 volts amplitude peak-to-peak. Set the frequency equal to the resonance
frequency. On the oscilloscope channel 1 you will see the input signal and the
output signal on channel 2. Observe in Figure 7 how the output signal is almost
in phase with the input.

Choose another two values of frequency, for example the values at the ends of
the sweep interval and see how the circuit responds for these.
