Resistors
=========

**Understanding the differences between available resistor types and how to select the right one.**

First we will discuss the familiar "discrete" or axial-lead type resistors we
are used to working with in the lab; then we will compare cost and performance
tradeoffs of the discrete versions and thin- or thick-film networks.

**Axial Lead Types:**

The three most common types of axial-lead resistors are carbon composition, or
carbon film, metal film and wire-wound:

• Carbon composition or carbon film-type resistors are used in general-purpose circuits where initial accuracy and stability with variations of temperature are not considered critical. Typical applications include their use as a collector or emitter load, in transistor/FET biasing networks, as a discharge path for charged capacitors, and as pull-up and/or pull-down elements in digital logic circuits.

Carbon-type resistors are assigned a series of standard values (Table 1) in a
quasi-logarithmic sequence, from 1 ohm to 22 megohms, with tolerances from 2%
(carbon film) to 5% up to 20% (carbon composition). Power dissipation ratings
range from 1/8 watt up to 2 watts. The 1/4-watt and 1/2-watt, 5% and 10% types
tend to be the most common. Carbon-type resistors have a poor temperature
coefficient (typically 5,000 ppm/°C); so they are not well suited for precision
applications requiring little resistance change over temperature, but they are
inexpensive-as little as 3 cents [USD 0.03] each in quantities of 100 or more.

Table 1 lists a decade (10:1 range) of standard resistance values for 2% and 5%
tolerances, spaced 10% apart. The smaller subset in lightface denote the only
values available with 10% or 20% tolerances; they are spaced 20% apart.

Carbon-type resistors use color-coded bands to identify the resistor's ohmic
value and tolerance: (For more on the resistor color code see the section below

• Metal film resistors are chosen for precision applications where initial accuracy, low temperature coefficient, and lower noise are required. Metal film resistors are generally composed of Nichrome, tin oxide or tantalum nitride, and are available in either a hermetically sealed or molded phenolic body. Typical applications include bridge circuits, RC oscillators and active filters. Initial accuracies range from 0.1 to 1.0 %, with temperature coefficients ranging between 10 and 100 ppm/°C. Standard values range from 10.0 Ω to 301 kΩ in discrete increments of 2% (for 0.5% and 1% rated tolerances).

Table 3. Standard values for film-type resistors

Metal film resistors use a 4 digit numbering sequence to identify the resistor
value instead of the color band scheme used for carbon types:

   Figure 2 Metal film resistors

The indicated resistance here is 4990?. For values less than 100, an "R"
indicates a decimal point, e.g., 49R9 = 49.9?

• Wire-wound precision resistors are extremely accurate and stable (0.05%, <10 ppm/°C); they are used in demanding applications, such as tuning networks and precision attenuator circuits. Typical resistance values run from 0.1 ? to 1.2 M?.

High Frequency Effects:
-----------------------

Unlike its "ideal" counterpart, a "real" resistor, like a real capacitor (Analog
Dialogue 30-2), suffers from parasitics. (Actually, any two-terminal element may
look like a resistor, capacitor, inductor, or damped resonant circuit, depending
on the frequency it's tested at.)

|image4|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 3 High frequency resistor model

Factors such as resistor base material and the ratio of length to
cross-sectional area determine the extent to which the parasitic L and C affect
the constancy of a resistor's effective dc resistance at high frequencies. Film
type resistors generally have excellent high-frequency response; the best
maintain their accuracy to about 100 MHz. Carbon types are useful to about 1
MHz. Wire-wound resistors have the highest inductance, and the poorest frequency
response. Even if they are non-inductively wound, they tend to have high
capacitance and are likely to be unsuitable for use above 50 kHz.

Temperature effects: Should you always use resistors with the lowest temperature coefficient (TCRs)?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not necessarily. A lot depends on the application. For the single resistor shown
in figure 4, measuring current in a loop, the current produces a voltage across
the resistor equal to I × R. In this application, the absolute accuracy of
resistance at any temperature would be critical to the accuracy of the current
measurement, so a resistor with a very low TC would be used.

|image5|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 4 Measuring current

A different example is the behavior of gain-setting resistors in a gain-of-100
op amp circuit, shown in figure 5. In this type of application, where gain
accuracy depends on the ratio of resistances (a ratiometric configuration),
resistance matching, and the tracking of the resistance temperature coefficients
(TCRs), is more critical than absolute accuracy.

|image6|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 5 Gain Stage

Here are a couple of examples that make the point.

1. Assume both resistors have an actual TC of 100 ppm/°C (i.e., 0.01%/°C). The
   resistance following a temperature change, ΔT, is:

.. container:: centeralign

   R = R\ :sub:`0`\ (1+ TC ΔT)

For a 10°C temperature rise, both R\ :sub:`F` and R\ :sub:`I` increase by 0.01%/°C × 10°C = 0.1%. Op amp gains are [to a very good approximation] 1 + R\ :sub:`F`/R\ :sub:`I`. Since both resistance values, though quite different (99:1), have increased by the same percentage, their ratio and the gain is unchanged. Note that the gain accuracy depends just on the resistance ratio, independently of the absolute values.

2. Assume that R\ :sub:`I` has a TC of 100 ppm/°C, but R\ :sub:`F`'s TC is only 75 ppm/°C. For a 10°C change, R\ :sub:`I` increases by 0.1% to 1.001 times its initial value, and R\ :sub:`F` increases by 0.075% to 1.00075 times its initial value. The new value of gain is

.. container:: centeralign

   (1.00075 R\ :sub:`F`)/(1.001 R\ :sub:`I`) = 0.99975 R\ :sub:`F`/R\ :sub:`I`

For an ambient temperature change of 10°C, the amplifier circuit's gain has
decreased by 0.025% (equivalent to 1 LSB in a 12-bit system).

Another parameter that's not often understood is the self-heating effect in a
resistor.

Self-heating causes a change in resistance because of the increase in
temperature when the dissipated power increases. Most manufacturers' data sheets
will include a specification called "thermal resistance" or "thermal derating",
expressed in degrees C per watt (°C/W). For a 1/4-watt resistor of typical size,
the thermal resistance is about 125°C/W. Let's apply this to the example of the
above op amp circuit for full-scale input:

Power dissipated by R\ :sub:`I` is V\ :sup:`2`/R = (100 mV)2/100 W = 100 µW, leading to a temperature change of 100 µW × 125°C/W = 0.0125°C, and a negligible 1-ppm resistance change (0.00012%).

Power dissipated by R\ :sub:`F` is V\ :sup:`2`/R = (9.9 V)2/9900 W = 9.9 mW, leading to a temperature change of 0.0099 W × 125°C/W = 1.24°C, and a resistance change of 0.0124%, which translates directly into a 0.012% gain change.

Thermocouple Effects:
---------------------

Wire-wound precision resistors have another problem. The junction of the
resistance wire and the resistor lead forms a thermocouple which has a
thermoelectric EMF of 42 µV/°C for the standard "Alloy 180"/Nichrome junction of
an ordinary wire-wound resistor. If a resistor is chosen with the [more
expensive] copper/nichrome junction, the value is 2.5 µV/°C. ("Alloy 180" is the
standard component lead alloy of 77% copper and 23% nickel.) Such thermocouple
effects are unimportant in ac applications, and they cancel out when both ends
of the resistor are at the same temperature; however if one end is warmer than
the other, either because of the power being dissipated in the resistor, or its
location with respect to heat sources, the net thermoelectric EMF will introduce
an erroneous dc voltage into the circuit. With an ordinary wire-wound resistor,
a temperature differential of only 4°C will introduce a dc error of 168 µV-which
is greater than 1 LSB in a 10-V/16-bit system! This problem can be fixed by
mounting wire-wound resistors so as to insure that temperature differentials are
minimized.

This may be done by keeping both leads of equal length, to equalize thermal
conduction through them, by insuring that any airflow (whether forced or natural
convection) is normal to the resistor body, and by taking care that both ends of
the resistor are at the same thermal distance (i.e., receive equal heat flow)
from any heat source on the PC board.

Resistor Networks
-----------------

A resistor network is a single package that contains two or more resistors. The
package will include multiple leads by which the network can be made part of a
larger circuit. Figure 7 shows typical packages used for resistor networks.
There are commonly two ways the resistors are connected in the array, isolated
and bussed where one end of all the resistors share a common connection as shown
in figure 8. The bussed arrangement is commonly used for pull up, pull down or
bus termination on logic signals.

The differences between "thin-film" and "thick-film" networks
-------------------------------------------------------------

Besides the obvious advantage of taking up considerably less real estate,
resistor networks-whether as a separate entity, or part of a monolithic IC-offer
the advantages of high accuracy via laser trimming, tight TC matching, and good
temperature tracking. Typical applications for discrete networks are in
precision attenuators and gain setting stages. Thin film networks are also used
in the design of monolithic (IC) and hybrid instrumentation amplifiers, and in
CMOS D/A and A/D converters that employ an R-2R Ladder network topology.

Thick film resistors are the lowest-cost type-they have fair matching (<0.1%),
but poor TC performance (>100 ppm/°C) and tracking (>10 ppm/°C).They are
produced by screening or electroplating the resistive element onto a substrate
material, such as glass or ceramic.

Thin film networks are moderately priced and offer good matching (0.01%), plus
good TC (<100 ppm/°C) and tracking (<10 ppm/°C). All are laser trimmable. Thin
film networks are manufactured using vapor deposition.

Tables 4 compares the advantages/disadvantages of a thick film and several types
of thin-film resistor networks. Table 5 compares substrate materials.

Table 5. Substrate Materials

In the example of the IC instrumentation amplifier shown figure 9, tight matching between resistors R\ :sub:`1`-R\ :sub:`1`', R\ :sub:`2`-R\ :sub:`2`', R\ :sub:`3`- R\ :sub:`3`' insures high common-mode rejection (as much as 120 dB, dc to 60 Hz). While it is possible to achieve higher common mode rejection using discrete op amps and resistors, the arduous task of matching the resistor elements is undesirable in a production environment.

Matching, rather than absolute accuracy, is also important in R-2R ladder
networks (including the feedback resistor) of the type used in CMOS D/A
converters. To achieve n-bit performance, the resistors have to be matched to
within 1/2n, which is easily achieved through laser trimming. Absolute accuracy
error, however, can be as much as ±20%. Shown in figure 10 is a typical R-2R
ladder network used in a CMOS digital to analog converter.

A brief history of the resistor color code:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is excerpted from a mixture of:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Industries_Alliance#History https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code#History https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/7096/resistor-color-code https://hackaday.com/2020/01/13/why-do-resistors-have-a-color-code/ https://www.dailybreak.com/break/cabinet-of-curiosities-why-indigo-is-in-the-rainbow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton's_occult_studies

Before industry standards were established (1925), each manufacturer used their
own unique system for color coding or marking their components.

Then in 1924, 50 radio manufacturers in Chicago formed a trade group. The idea
was to share patents among the members. Almost immediately the name changed from
“Associated Radio Manufacturers” to the “Radio Manufacturer’s Association” or
RMA.

The standard color code was developed by the Radio Manufacturers Association
(RMA) in the 20’s as a three band code for resistor values. The three bands were
more compact than the number value because the third band represented the number
of zeroes. Initially the three colors were not three separate bands, and there
was no neutral background color. Instead, they were the body color, the tip
color and the dot color.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/university/courses/electronics/resistor-colors.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

Identical adjacent colors were allowed.

For example, 250 000 Ω was reduced to three bands. In addition, color bands
remained visible in whatever position a resistor was soldered, whereas a stamped
number value could be out of sight. The fourth band, representing the tolerance,
was added later.

`Radio Physics Course, Ghirardi, 1931 <https://books.google.nl/books?id=VJALAQAAIAAJ&q=%22The%20code%20identifies%20resistors%20by%20means%20of%203%20colors,%20known%20as%20%22body,%22%20%22tip%22%20and%20%22dot%22%20colors%22&dq=%22The%20code%20identifies%20resistors%20by%20means%20of%203%20colors,%20known%20as%20%22body,%22%20%22tip%22%20and%20%22dot%22%20colors%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGoq-m5cjZAhWCjqQKHQmgBi8Q6AEILTAB>`_

In 1952, it was standardized in IEC 62:1952 by the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and since 1963 also published as EIA RS-279.

The sequence of the central group of colors, ROYGBV, was chosen to match the rainbow mnemonic: red-orange-yellow-green-blue-violet, "ROYGBIV", without indigo because most people do not (can not) distinguish, with their eyes, a separate color between blue and violet, plus it’s a little silly color; and is only there because Newton was a little bit of a kook. (Of the rainbow's widely accepted seven colors, three are primary (red, yellow and blue); three are secondary (green, orange and violet) and just one is tertiary (indigo) – When Newton in 1665 named the colors in the rainbow after passing them through a prism – he wanted to the colors in the rainbow to match the 7 notes in a Dorian scale (a scale with no sharps or flats that starts on D), and Newton had a history of dabbling in the occult, and seven is considered a sacred number in the secretive paranormal sciences). The rainbow group is preceded by two low brightness colors, black and brown, representing the lowest digits 0 and 1, and succeeded by two bright colors, grey and white, representing the highest digits 8 and 9.

`Electrical Engineering Science, Preston, 1960, p.115 <https://books.google.nl/books?id=4tkiAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y>`_

Color bands were used because they were easily and cheaply printed on tiny
components. However, there were drawbacks, especially for color blind people.
Overheating of a component or dirt accumulation may make it impossible to
distinguish brown from red or orange. Advances in printing technology have now
made printed numbers more practical on small components. The values of
components in surface mount packages are marked with printed alphanumeric codes
instead of a color code.
