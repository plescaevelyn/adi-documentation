Introduction
------------

Today’s electronic devices are made up of a wide variety of components. Some,
like resistors and capacitors, are simple and passive, while others, such as
advanced central processing unit (CPU) chips, are extremely complex and can
contain over 20 billion transistors. In this lab, we introduce some simple
components and some equipment that can be used to generate and characterize
electronic signals in the forms of voltages and currents.

Theory
------

The components introduced in this lab will be used in the following labs to construct circuits that increase in complexity as the labs go on. The first of the subsequent labs uses two of the passive elements – resistors and capacitors – in ways that help illustrate how these elements behave in circuits.

Resistors (R) have the units of ohms (Ω), and control the instantaneous relationship between voltage (V) and current (I) according to Ohm’s law, V = I\*R. Capacitors store electric charge, allow more current to flow as the signal frequency increases, and exhibit a phase shift between voltage and current in which the sinusoidal current leads the voltage by 90 degrees, or equivalently, the sinusoidal voltage lags the current by 90 degrees. Inductors behave in an opposite fashion. Inductors store energy in a magnetic field, allow less current to flow as the signal frequency increases, and exhibit a phase shift between voltage and current in which the sinusoidal voltage leads the current by 90 degrees, or equivalently, the sinusoidal current lags the voltage by 90 degrees. Resistors, capacitors, and inductors do not add any energy to a circuit, and therefore cannot be used to amplify the power of a signal.

Diodes are the simplest of semiconductor devices and allow current flow in only
one direction. The original diodes were electronic tubes, constructed of a
filament that emitted electrons and a metal plate that collected the electrons.
In these diodes, the electrons can only flow from the filament to the plate when
the plate is biased at a positive voltage that attracts the negatively-charged
electrons. Modern diodes use a semiconductor ‘pn junction” to obtain the same
result. Diodes are often used as switches, and to convert alternating current
(AC) to direct current (DC).

Transistors have three terminals in most cases, and are the simplest
semiconductor devices that are capable of amplifying the power of a signal. This
is accomplished by applying the signal to be amplified to the transistor input
terminal, and using the input signal to control the power from an external power
supply according to the input signal. The signal with increased power is
available at the output terminal. The transistor output is therefore a replica
of the input signal with increased voltage amplitude, current amplitude, or
both. The third terminal is generally connected to a reference voltage.

Op-amps are examples of ICs that are most often used in negative feedback
configurations to provide signal amplification that is of better quality than
can be obtained with a single transistor. In the fourth lab, an op-amp is
combined with a 2N3904 transistor to provide signal voltage amplification and
current amplification to drive a loudspeaker. The op-amp provides the voltage
gain and the transistor, placed inside the negative feedback loop to provide the
best performance, provides the current gain.

Observations and Conclusions
----------------------------

-  Resistors, capacitors, and inductors are simple passive circuit elements that can be used to process signals with regard to amplitude and frequency response. They cannot amplify the power of a signal.
-  Diodes can be used as simple electronic switches, and are often used in the conversion of AC power to DC power.
-  Transistors are the simplest electronic devices that are capable of amplifying signal power
-  Op-amps are ICs that are normally operated in negative feedback
   configurations, and are often used to amplify signals at a better quality
   level than that available with a simple transistor
