Energy & Power Systems Activities Outline
=========================================

Objective:
----------

The objectives of the Lab Activities centered around the Energy and Power
Systems (EPS) Hardware Module are to explore a variety of electrical engineering
concepts related to the generation, storage and control of energy and power.

Some of the experiments are best constructed first on a solder-less breadboard
before incorporating them onto the main system board. Some things like the motor
and generator only work well when firmly attached to a board. Many of the basic
components can be found in the Analog Parts Kits but additional quantities of
certain parts will be needed beyond those in the Kit. A complete list is
included later in this document.

Energy and Power Systems (EPS) Hardware Module:
-----------------------------------------------

The hardware module consists of a roughly 3.5" X 4" circuit board that provides
space for a small mechanically interconnected motor-generator set that can serve
as a model for a power plant that utilizes expendable fuels. A port for
connecting a small solar panel is provided to model an intermittent renewable
energy source. Six switchable LEDs serve as a variable load to the simulated
power system.

It models power generation, and distribution in a simulated real-life setting.
Analog Discovery along with the Waveforms software and custom software is used
to measure the operating parameters and control the system as the power produced
from the motor-generator and solar panel change and as the load changes. A
rechargeable battery is connected to store excess power when generation is
larger than the load and release power when the load demand is greater than the
generation capacity. This is measured through things such as the power produced
and consumed, as well as an RPM measurement from the motor-generator.

Figure 1 is the schematic of the system board. Figure 2 shows a completed board
connected to the Discovery module, a 9V 6 cell AA battery holder (to power the
DC motor), a small solar array and a rechargeable NiCd battery pack. A Hall
effect sensor and magnet mounted on the motor-generator shaft measures the RPM.

   Table 2

Most suppliers sell passive components like resistors in large minimum
quantities of 100 or 200 pieces at very low effective unit prices. Radio Shack
offers resistors in quantities of 5 but at a much higher unit cost.
MCMElectronics.com offers 1/8 watt resistors in quantities of 20 at reasonable
cost as listed in table 2. DigiKey will sell any quantity down to single
resistors at $0.10 each for 1/6 watt 5% carbon film types. Electronix Express
sells 1/4 watt resistors in minimum quantities of 10 at $0.06 each.

Notes on alternate sources:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No one supplier can provide the complete list of components. Prices can vary
widely from supplier to supplier for essentially the same component. It's a
matter of how much time one wishes to put into shopping around to find the best
prices for each major component.

The same 60X60 mm 4.5 Volt solar panels are available from `Electronic Goldmine <http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=G16394>`_, part number G16394, for $3.50 each which is less than half the Jameco price.

The same 9V DC motors are available from DigiKey, part number P14356-ND, for
$3.53 each. The 3.6V rechargeable NiCd or NiMH three cell batteries are commonly
used in cordless telephone handsets and can be sourced from many places such as
this one from Sears: Item# SPM7155360313, OEM Cordless Phone Battery, 3.6V /
800mAh, Uniden BT-446.

Construction directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assemble the Power and Energy Systems PC board, you need certain hand tools
such as a wire cutter, wire stripper, long nose pliers, and a soldering iron.
Use caution with the soldering iron, as it get very hot! When soldering parts
onto a circuit board, it is best to start with the shortest pieces and work your
way up to the taller ones. The reason is that when you turn the board over to
solder, the shorter pieces will not be held in by the table if taller pieces are
already placed on the board. Often it is helpful to use small pieces of masking
tape to hold the smaller components in place while soldering. The following
steps are ordered for ease of installation.

.. note::

   Under construction

   
   DC Motors -The two mechanically coupled 9V DC motors comprise a
   motor/generator set. The first motor takes electrical energy from the battery
   and converts it into mechanical energy. This models the actual process
   whereby the mechanical force from an energy source such as wind, flowing
   water or a spinning a turbine from burning fuels is converted into a physical
   motion,. The second motor (GEN) is the generator that takes mechanical energy
   from the first motor and converts it back into electricity in our case.
   
   Hall Effect Sensor - The Hall effect sensor measures how fast the motor is
   spinning (RPM) by detecting the magnet mounted on the shafts along with the
   heat shrink tubing connecting the motors. It is powered by the Discovery 5V
   power supply, and uses a pull-up resistor connected to the open drain output
   of the sensor to a generate a logic level detectable by a digital input.
   Digital input DI 15 then reads 5 V pulses using an edge count, which is
   converted into an RPM in the software program.

**Energy Expenditure**

The power provided by the mechanical and solar energy sources is combined and
used to power up to six LEDs, representing any kind of load that might be used
in a real-life power system (lights, air conditioners, etc.). The power must
reach a certain threshold before the LEDs will turn on. LEDs-The LEDs provide
the function of simulating a load. Lighting the LEDs is the ultimate purpose of
the power system, and so it is essential that the proper power is applied to
them. The LEDs operate at around 1.67 V, and will usually turn on when about 4.5
V is applied to the generator (may vary depending on efficiency of the motors,
battery life, etc.). In the case of real-life loads powered by plants, there
exists a variable demand for power. Since electrical energy cannot be stored, it
must be continually generated to meet the demand, requiring some sort of control
system.
