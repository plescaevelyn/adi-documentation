Activity: The Common Base Amplifier
===================================

Objective:
----------

To investigate the simple NPN common base amplifier also sometimes referred to
as the cascode configuration.

Notes:
------

As in all the ALM labs we use the following terminology when referring to the
connections to the M1000 connector and configuring the hardware. The green
shaded rectangles indicate connections to the M1000 analog I/O connector. The
analog I/O channel pins are referred to as CA and CB. When configured to force
voltage / measure current -V is added as in CA-V or when configured to force
current / measure voltage -I is added as in CA-I. When a channel is configured
in the high impedance mode to only measure voltage -H is added as CA-H.

Scope traces are similarly referred to by channel and voltage / current. Such as
CA-V , CB-V for the voltage waveforms and CA-I , CB-I for the current waveforms.

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM1000 hardware module Solder-less breadboard Jumper wires 1 - 100 Ω Resistor ( R\ :sub:`C` ) 1 - small signal NPN transistor ( 2N3904 or similar Q\ :sub:`1` )

Directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The breadboard connections for the common base amplifier tests are shown in
figure 1. The 2.5V mid supply voltage output is used as the fixed common voltage
point for the base terminal. An input current is supplied to the emitter from
channel A in source current mode. Channel B in Hi-Z mode measures the collector
voltage.

Hardware Setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The channel A generator should be configured in the SIMV mode with a 100 Hz Sine
wave with -20 mA Min and 0 mA Max value. The measured voltage waveform trace for
channel A is used to display the emitter voltage. The scope channel CB-H is used
to measure the voltage at the collector.

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

Using the measurement plots and data taken calculate the voltage gain, current
gain, input resistance and output resistance for the common base amplifier.

Voltage gain approximate expression: A\ :sub:`V` = g\ :sub:`m`\ R\ :sub:`C`

Current gain approximate expression: A\ :sub:`I` = I\ :sub:`C`/I\ :sub:`E` = αI\ :sub:`E`

Input resistance approximate expression: R\ :sub:`In` = r\ :sub:`e` ˜ 1/g\ :sub:`m`

Output resistance approximate expression: R\ :sub:`Out` = R\ :sub:`C`\ \||r\ :sub:`o` ˜ R\ :sub:`C` ( when R\ :sub:`C` << r\ :sub:`o` )

Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~

What is the maximum peak to peak output voltage swing that can be produced with
the common base stage as shown in figure 1? What limits the maximum and minimum
voltage extremes and why? What happens to the input impedance when the output
reaches one or the other extreme? What happens to the output impedance when the
output reaches one or the other extreme?
