Activity: Impedance Measurement - Frequency Effects, For ADALM1000
==================================================================

Objective:
----------

The objective of this Lab activity is to: 1. Measure component impedance and
circuit impedance using the ALICE-VVM Impedance Analyzer software. 2. Study the
magnitude and phase changes with change in frequency for an RLC circuit.

Notes:
------

As in all the ALM labs we use the following terminology when referring to the
connections to the M1000 connector and configuring the hardware. The green
shaded rectangles indicate connections to the M1000 analog I/O connector. The
analog I/O channel pins are referred to as CA and CB. When configured to force
voltage / measure current -V is added as in CA-V or when configured to force
current / measure voltage -I is added as in CA-I. When a channel is configured
in the high impedance mode to only measure voltage -H is added as CA-H.

Scope traces are similarly referred to by channel and voltage / current. Such as
CA-V , CB-V for the voltage waveforms and CA-I , CB-I for the current waveforms.

Background:
-----------

Impedance is the resistance to the flow of alternating current. It is the total
opposition that a circuit offers to the flow of current at a particular
frequency. Impedance (Z) is expressed as a combination of Resistance (R) and
Reactance (X) and is measured in ohms (Ω). It can be expressed as a complex
quantity as:

:math:`Z=R+jX`

The impedance is represented on a 2-D polar plot which has x as real axis and y
as Imaginary axis. The resistive component is a line along the real axis and the
reactive component is a line along the imaginary axis.

For a resistor, the impedance is the same as the DC resistance and is a line along the x - axis. For a capacitor, the impedance (or more specifically, the reactance) X\ :sub:`C` is imaginary and is represented as a line along the negative y-axis of the 2-D polar plot. The reactance of the capacitor depends upon the frequency and is given as:

:math:`X_C = 1/(\omega C)`

Where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency.

For an inductor, the impedance (or more specifically, the reactance) XL is
imaginary and can be represented as a line along the positive y-axis of the 2-D
plot. The reactance of the inductor also depends upon the frequency and is given
as:

:math:`X_L = \omega L`

The impedance of a series RLC circuit is the sum of the impedances of respective
components.

:math:`Z= R + Z_L + Z_C`

( or )

:math:`Z= R + j X_L - j X_C`

This can also be represented as a phasor vector on a polar plot with:

:math:`Magnitude = sqrt(R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2)`

:math:`Phase = Tan^-1((X_L - X_C) / R )`

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM1000 hardware module Resistors (1.0 KΩ, 470 Ω) Capacitor (1.0 µF) Inductor
(10 mH)

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

A. Measurement of Component Impedance:

1. With a resistor R\ :sub:`EXT` = 1 KΩ connected between CA-V and CB-V, connect a 470 Ω resistor as R\ :sub:`S`\ between CB-V and the fixed 2.5 V supply.

2. Run the ALICE-VVM software tool.

3. Note down the magnitude, phase, resistance and reactance for the resistor in
   the table shown in figure 3. Note that the default frequency is set to 1000
   Hz. Verify that the phasor is along the real axis and the phase is zero. Also
   the magnitude should be the same as resistance since the reactance is zero.

4. Replace R\ :sub:`S` with C\ :sub:`S` = 1.0 uF, Similarly note down the magnitude, phase, resistance and reactance values. For the capacitor, the phasor should be along the negative imaginary axis and the phase should be 270 or -90 degrees.

5. Replace C\ :sub:`S` with L\ :sub:`S` = 20 mH, Similarly note down the magnitude, phase, resistance and reactance values. For the inductor, the phasor should be along the positive imaginary axis and the phase should be 90 degrees.

B. Measurement of Circuit Impedance and Effects of Frequency on RLC circuit:

1. Setup the series RLC circuit shown in Figure 1 with the given component values. R\ :sub:`EXT` = 1 KΩ, R\ :sub:`s` = 470 Ω, C\ :sub:`S` = 1.0 uF and L\ :sub:`S` = 20 mH.

2. Note down the magnitude, phase, reactance and resistances for the RLC circuit
   at the default frequency of 1000 Hz. Record the values in table shown in
   figure 3.

3. Adjust the frequency till the phase becomes zero and note down this
   frequency. This is a special frequency where the total reactance is zero and
   the circuit is purely resistive.

:math:`Z= R + j (X_L - X_C)`

If :math:`X_L - X_C = 0` (1)

Then :math:`Z=R`

Thus, the impedance of the RLC circuit is now just the resistance. The frequency
at which this occurs is called resonant frequency. It can be mathematically
derived using equation (1) to be:

:math:`f_o = 1/(2pi sqrtLC)` (2)

4. Vary the frequency below f\ :sub:`o` in steps of 100 Hz and take up to three measurement readings from the impedance analyzer. Record the readings in a table as shown in figure 5 ( add more rows to table as necessary). Repeat the same by varying the frequency above f\ :sub:`o` in steps of 100 Hz. Observe carefully, the rotation of the magnitude phasor (orange line ).

Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Compute the resonant frequency f\ :sub:`o` for the series RLC using equation (2) and compare it to the measured value. What is the percentage error between the two?

2. Give your conclusions from the observations made in step (4) of the
   procedure.

3. Compute the magnitude and phase for the series RLC circuit, when the reactive
   component equals the resistive component.
