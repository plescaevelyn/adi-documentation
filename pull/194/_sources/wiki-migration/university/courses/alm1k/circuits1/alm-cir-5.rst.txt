Activity: Transient Response of RC Circuit, For ADALM1000
=========================================================

Objective:
----------

The objective of this Lab activity is to study the transient response of a
series RC circuit and understand the time constant concept using pulse
waveforms.

Notes:
------

As in all the ALM labs we use the following terminology when referring to the
connections to the M1000 connector and configuring the hardware. The green
shaded rectangles indicate connections to the M1000 analog I/O connector. The
analog I/O channel pins are referred to as CA and CB. When configured to force
voltage / measure current -V is added as in CA-V or when configured to force
current / measure voltage -I is added as in CA-I. When a channel is configured
in the high impedance mode to only measure voltage -H is added as CA-H.

Scope traces are similarly referred to by channel and voltage / current. Such as
CA-V , CB-V for the voltage waveforms and CA-I , CB-I for the current waveforms.

Background:
-----------

In this lab activity you will apply a pulse waveform to the RC circuit to
analyses the transient response of the circuit. The pulse-width relative to a
circuit's time constant determines how it is affected by an RC circuit.

Time Constant (τ): Denoted by the Greek letter tau, τ, it represents a measure
of time required for certain changes in voltages and currents in RC and RL
circuits. Generally, when the elapsed time exceeds five time constants (5τ)
after switching has occurred, the currents and voltages have reached their final
value, which is also called steady-state response.

The time constant of an RC circuit is the product of equivalent capacitance and
the Thévenin resistance as viewed from the terminals of the equivalent
capacitor.

:math:`t = R \times C` (1)

A Pulse is a voltage or current that changes from one level to another and back
again. If a waveform's high time equals its low time it is called a square wave.
The length of each cycle of a pulse is its period (T).

The pulse width (tp) of an ideal square wave is equal to half the time period.

The relation between pulse width and frequency is then given by,

:math:`f = 1/(2t_p)` (2)

   Figure 1: Series RC circuit.

From Kirchhoff's laws, it can be shown that the charging voltage V\ :sub:`C` (t) across the capacitor is given by:

:math:`\displaystyle V_C(t) =V( 1- e^\frac{ -t}{RC }) for t >= 0` (3)

where, V is the applied source voltage to the circuit at time t = 0. The product
RC is the time constant. The response curve is increasing and is shown in figure
2.

   axis normalized by t

The discharge voltage for the capacitor is given by:

:math:`\displaystyle V_C (t) = V_o e^\frac{ -t}{RC } for t >= 0` (4)

Where Vo is the initial voltage stored in capacitor at t = 0. The product RC is
often referred to the so called time constant, τ. The response curve is a
decaying exponential as shown in figure 3.

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM1000 hardware module Resistors ( 2.2 KΩ, 10 KΩ) Capacitors (1 µF, 0.01 µF)

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Set up the circuit shown in figure 4 on your solderless breadboard with the component values R\ :sub:`1` = 2.2 KΩ and C\ :sub:`1` = 1 µF. Open the ALICE Oscilloscope software.

2. Set the channel A AWG Min value to 0.5 and Max value to 4.5V to apply a 4Vp-p
   square wave centered on 2.5 V as the input voltage to the circuit. From the
   AWG A Mode drop down menu select the SVMI mode. From the AWG A Shape drop
   down menus select Square. From the AWG B Mode drop down menu select the Hi-Z
   mode.

3. From the ALICE Curves drop down Menu select CA-V, and CB-V for display. From
   the Trigger drop down menu select CA-V and Auto Level. Adjust the time base
   until you have at approximately two cycles of the square wave on the display
   grid.

   Figure 6: Oscilloscope Configuration.

This configuration uses the oscilloscope to look at the input of the circuit on
channel A and the output of the circuit on channel B. Make sure you have checked
the Sync AWG selector.

4. Observe the response of the circuit for the following three cases and record
   the results.

a. Pulse width >> 5t : Set the frequency of AWG A output such that the capacitor
   has enough time to fully charge and discharge during each cycle of the square
   wave. So let the pulse width be 15t and set the frequency according to
   equation (2). The value you have found should be approximately 15 Hz.
   Determine the time constant from the waveforms obtained on the screen if you
   can. If you cannot obtain the time constant easily, explain possible reasons.

b. Pulse width = 5t : Set the frequency such that the pulse width = 5t (this
   should be approximately 45 Hz). Since the pulse width is 5t, the capacitor
   should just be able to fully charge and discharge during each pulse cycle.
   From the figure determine t (see figure 2 and figure 7 below.)

   of squares.

c. Pulse width << 5t : In this case the capacitor does not have time to charge
   significantly before it is switched to discharge, and vice versa. Let the
   pulse width be only 1.0t in this case and set the frequency accordingly.

5. Repeat the procedure using R\ :sub:`1` = 10 KΩ and C\ :sub:`1` = 0.01 µF and record the measurements.

Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Calculate the time constant using equation (1) and compare it to the measured
   value from 4b. Repeat this for other set of R and C values.

2. Discuss the effects of changing component values.
