Activity: AM Modulation and the Envelope Detector
=================================================

Objective:
----------

In this lab activity we will use the :adi:`ADALM1000 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm1000.html>` to introduce amplitude modulation (AM) and envelope detection demodulation. A signal's envelope is equivalent to its outline, and an envelope detector connects the amplitude peaks of the signal. :doc:`Envelope detection </wiki-migration/university/courses/electronics/text/chapter-7>` has numerous applications in the fields of signal processing and communications, one of which is amplitude modulation (AM) detection or demodulation.

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in electronic
communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio frequency
carrier wave. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the
carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted. That
waveform may, for instance, correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a
loudspeaker, or the light intensity of television pixels.

A typical **amplitude modulated signal** has the following equation:

:math:`s(t) = [1 + k cos(w_m t)] A cos(w_c t)`

where:

-   :math:`m(t) = k cos(w_m t)` - message signal
-   :math:`c(t) = Acos(w_c t)` - carrier signal
-  k - modulation index (typically varies between 0 and 1)
-  ω\ :sub:`m` - message frequency
-  A - carrier amplitude
-  ω\ :sub:`c` - carrier frequency

An envelope detector is an electronic circuit that takes a high-frequency signal as input and provides an output which is the envelope of the original signal. (ω\ :sub:`c` >> ω\ :sub:`m`)

It consists of two main elements:

-  Diode / rectifier - serves to pass one half of the received signal over the other.
-  Low pass filter - required to remove the high frequency content that remains
   in the signal after detection / demodulation. The filter can consist of a
   very simple RC low pass filter network but in some cases It can be provided
   simply by relying on the limited frequency response of the circuitry
   following the rectifier.

Envelope Detector
-----------------

Consider the circuit presented in Figure 1. Two 0.1 uF capacitors are used in
parallel to form a 0.2 uF total capacitance which along with the 10 KΩ resistor
for a simple low pass filter.

   Figure 1, Envelope Detector Circuit

The capacitor in the circuit stores up charge on the rising edge, and releases
it slowly through the resistor when the signal falls. The diode in series
rectifies the incoming signal, allowing current flow only when the positive
input terminal is at a higher potential than the negative input terminal.

Hardware Setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the circuit from figure 1 on your solderless breadboard for the envelope
detector. Leave the CH A and CH B connections to the ADALM1000 disconnected for
now while we generate an amplitude modulated test signal.

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use the channel A waveform generator as source to provide the AM signal,
with the following parameters:

-  Min = 1.7
-  Max = 3.3
-  Freq = 100Hz

We will use the channel B waveform generator as source to provide the carrier
signal, with the following parameters:

-  Min = 1.5
-  Max = 3.5
-  Freq = 10KHz

With both CH A and CH B set to SVMI mode and Shape Sine you should see waveforms
something like those shown in figure 2. Set the Horizontal time scale to 2.0
mSec/Div to display 2 cycles of the 100 Hz waveform.

   Figure 2, Generated modulating and carrier signals

To generate the modulated signal we will use the Math function from the ALICE
signal generator CH A. With the program paused, select the Math option under the
Shape drop down menu. Enter the following equation which multiplies the captured
modulation waveform from channel A with the captured carrier waveform from
channel B. Because the signals are centered on 2.5 V that DC portion of the
waveforms much be subtracted out. The 2.5 volt offset is then added back to
after the multiplication to center the modulated signal in the 0 to 5 V range of
the ALM1000.

(VBuffA-0.6)*(VBuffB-2.5)+2.5

The generated waveform is presented in Figure 3 as the green trace from CH A.
Disconnect the capacitors from the circuit and observe the output signal. With
CH B in the Hi Z mode connect it both CH-A and CH-B to your circuit.

   Figure 3, Positive Half of the generated AM signal

Use the vertical range and position controls to shift the traces so that they
don not overlap each other. This make it easier to see the two waveforms.
Without the capacitor connected, the circuit works like a positive half-wave
rectifier that keeps the part of the signal that is above 2.5 V.

Now connect the capacitors back to the circuit. A plot example is presented in
Figure 4.

   Figure 4, Filtered demodulated signal

The resulting demodulated signal is the envelope of the positive half wave
obtained previously. It is actually the 100 Hz message signal with some 10 KHz
ripple on it.

Frequency Domain Spectrum
-------------------------

We can also view these signals in the frequency domain using the Spectrum
Analyzer tool. First we can look at the 10 KHz carrier and 100 Hz modulating
signals separately. Configure the CH A and CH B signal generators as they were
back in the first step where they were both set to sine shape and in SVMI mode.
Disconnect both channels from your circuit so that they don't interfere with
each other.

Open the Spectrum analyzer tool. Set the Cut-DC option to on. Select the CA-dBV
and CB-dbV curves for display. Set the Start frequency 100 and the Stop
frequency to 50000 with the log frequency scale. Set the number of samples to
16384. With the analyzer running you should see something like the spectrum
shown in figure 5.

   Figure 5, Carrier and modulating signal spectrum

As we can see we have the single peak at 100 Hz of the modulating signal on CH-A
and the single peak at 10 KHz of the carrier signal on CH-B.

Now regenerate the Math modulated waveform in Channel A. You can reconnect CH-A
and CH-B to your circuit and put CH-B back in Hi-Z mode. Now if we zoom into the
channel A spectrum by setting the start frequency to 8000 and the stop frequency
to 12000 we can see, in figure 6, the main peak is at the 10 KHz carrier
frequency and there are the modulation side-bands +/- 100 Hz on either side of
the carrier. (i.e. 9900 Hz and 10100 Hz.

   Figure 6, Modulated Carrier signal spectrum

With the filter capacitor, if we look at the spectrum of the demodulated signal
after the envelop detector we see the large peak at 100 Hz and a greatly
attenuated peak at the 10 KHz carrier frequency as shown in figure 7.

Biased Envelope Detector
------------------------

The simple diode based envelope detector of figure 1 does not perform well or at
all if the amplitude i.e. Swing is less than the forward turn voltage of the
diode. It will suffer significant distortion on the negative half of the
modulation signal for high modulation indexes (near 100%) when the diode is not
fully turned on. A way around this limitation is to introduce a small DC bias to
the diode. This small bias current moves to quiescent operating point of the
circuit to right at the turn on point of the diode.

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM1000 Active Learning Module Solder-less breadboard, and jumper wire kit 1 - 1.5 KΩ resistor (brown green red) 1 - 10 KΩ resistor (brown black orange) 1 - 20 KΩ resistor (red black orange) 1 - 0.22uF capacitor, C\ :sub:`1` (224) 1 - 1.0uF capacitor, C\ :sub:`2` 1 - 2N3904 NPN transistor 1 - 1N914 diode

On your solder-less breadboard construct the biased envelope detector circuit as shown in Figure 8. The amplitude modulated signal is AC coupled into the Base of NPN transistor Q\ :sub:`1` which is configured as an emitter follower. Voltage divider R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` along with diode D\ :sub:`1` act to set the DC bias point of the AC coupled input (:doc:`DC restoration </wiki-migration/university/courses/electronics/text/chapter-7>`). Absent any modulated input the DC quiescent operating point seen at the emitter of Q\ :sub:`1` will be the voltage at the junction of R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` minus the diode drop of D\ :sub:`1` and the V\ :sub:`BE` of Q\ :sub:`1`. The base current of Q\ :sub:`1` flows in diode D\ :sub:`1` forward biasing it. During the positive half cycles of the modulated input D\ :sub:`1` turns off and the input signal peaks charge filter capacitor C\ :sub:`2`. During the negative half cycles of the input signal transistor Q\ :sub:`1` turns off and D\ :sub:`1` turns on harder supplying the input current.

   Figure 8. Biased Envelope Detector circuit

To test this circuit first use the same modulated signal you used in the simple
diode envelope detector example. Compare the new design to the simple diode
envelope detector. Using the same steps as earlier generate AM signals with
smaller amplitudes / higher modulation indexes and compare the outputs of these
two detector designs.
