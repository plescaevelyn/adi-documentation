Activity: Regulated Voltage Reference - ADALM1000
=================================================

Objective:
----------

The zero gain amplifier (Q\ :sub:`1`, R\ :sub:`2`) and stabilized current source (Q\ :sub:`2`, R\ :sub:`3`) from activities 7 and 8 can be used in conjunction with a PNP current mirror stage (Q\ :sub:`3`,Q\ :sub:`4`) in negative feedback to build a circuit which provides a constant or regulated output voltage over a range of input voltages.

Notes:
------

As in all the ALM labs we use the following terminology when referring to the
connections to the M1000 connector and configuring the hardware. The green
shaded rectangles indicate connections to the M1000 analog I/O connector. The
analog I/O channel pins are referred to as CA and CB. When configured to force
voltage / measure current -V is added as in CA-V or when configured to force
current / measure voltage -I is added as in CA-I. When a channel is configured
in the high impedance mode to only measure voltage -H is added as CA-H.

Scope traces are similarly referred to by channel and voltage / current. Such as
CA-V , CB-V for the voltage waveforms and CA-I , CB-I for the current
waveforms.*\* \*\*

Version 1
---------

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

ADALM1000 hardware module Solder-less breadboard Jumper wires 1 - 2.2 KΩ
Resistor ( or any similar value ) 1 - 100 Ω resistor 3 - small signal NPN
transistors (2N3904) 3 - small signal PNP transistors (2N3906)

Directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The breadboard connections are as shown in figure 1. The output of the channel A voltage generator, CA-V, drives the emitters of both PNP transistors Q\ :sub:`3` and Q\ :sub:`4`. Q\ :sub:`3` and Q\ :sub:`4` are wired as a current mirror with their bases connected together with the collector of Q\ :sub:`3`. The collector of Q\ :sub:`4` connects to resistor R\ :sub:`1`. Resistors R\ :sub:`1`, R\ :sub:`2` and transistor Q\ :sub:`1` are connected as in the previous zero gain amplifier section. Since the V\ :sub:`BE` of Q\ :sub:`2` is always smaller than the V\ :sub:`BE` of Q\ :sub:`1`, You should select Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2` from your inventory of devices such that (at the same collector current) Q\ :sub:`2`'s V\ :sub:`BE` is less than Q\ :sub:`1`'s V\ :sub:`BE`. The base of transistor Q\ :sub:`2` is connected to the zero gain output at the collector of Q\ :sub:`1`. The collector of Q\ :sub:`2` connects to the input side of the PNP current mirror at the base - collector of Q\ :sub:`3`. The CB-H scope input is used to measure the output voltage at the collector of Q\ :sub:`4`.

   Figure 1 Regulator Version 1

Hardware Setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel A voltage generator, CA-V, should be configured for a 100 Hz triangle wave with 5 volt Max and 0V Min values. The scope channel B is set to Hi-Z mode and CB-H is used to measure the stabilized output voltage at the collector of Q\ :sub:`4`.

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

Plot the output voltage (as measured at the collector of Q\ :sub:`4`) vs. the input voltage. At what input voltage level does the output voltage stop changing i.e. regulate? This is called the "drop out" voltage. For input voltages above the drop out voltage, how much does the output voltage change for each volt of change at the input? The change in Vout / change in Vin is called line regulation. Connect a variable resistor from the output node to ground. With the input voltage fixed (i.e. connected to the fixed +5 V board power supply), measure the output voltage for various settings of the resistor. Calculate the current in the resistor for each setting. How does the output voltage vary vs. output current? This is called load regulation.

Version 2:
----------

Objective:
~~~~~~~~~~

The problem with the circuit in regulator version 1 is that the current available to an output load is limited by the feedback current supplied from NPN Q\ :sub:`2` mirrored through PNPs Q\ :sub:`3` and Q\ :sub:`4`. It would be desirable to build a circuit which provides a constant or regulated output voltage over not only a range of input voltages but also output load currents. This second circuit utilizes an emitter follower output stage to provide the current to the output.

Materials:
~~~~~~~~~~

1 - 2.2 KΩ Resistor 1 - 100 Ω resistor 1 - 10 KΩ variable resistor
(potentiometer) 1 - 4.7 KΩ resistor (resistors can be any similar value selected
for desired circuit operation) 4 - small signal NPN transistors (2N3904 and
SSM2212)

Directions:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The breadboard connections are as shown in figure 2. As before transistor Q\ :sub:`1` and resistors R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`2` are configured as a zero gain amplifier. Transistor Q\ :sub:`2` and variable resistor R\ :sub:`3`\ form a stabilized current source. If the SSM2212 matched NPN pair is used it is best that it be used for devices Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`2`. Common emitter stage Q\ :sub:`3` along with its collector load R\ :sub:`4` provide gain. Emitter follower Q\ :sub:`4` drives the output node and closes the negative feedback loop.

   Figure 2 Regulator Version 2

Hardware Setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Channel A voltage generator, CA-V, should be configured for a 100 Hz triangle wave with 5 volt Max and 0 V Min values. As in version 1 the scope channel CB-H, in Hi-Z mode is used to measure the stabilized output voltage at the emitter of Q\ :sub:`4`.

Procedure:
~~~~~~~~~~

Repeat the drop out voltage, line and load regulation measurements for this
circuit. How are they different than the first regulator circuit?

Using an NPN transistor array:
------------------------------

The CA3045,46 ( LM3045, 46 ) NPN transistor array is a good alternate choice for
building this example circuit. See pinout below.

All the emitters can be tired to ground ( pins 3,7,10,13 ). Devices Q\ :sub:`1`, Q\ :sub:`2` and Q\ :sub:`3` can be connected in parallel and serve as Q\ :sub:`2` in figure 2. Q\ :sub:`4` and Q\ :sub:`5`\ can be used for Q\ :sub:`1` and Q\ :sub:`3`\ in figure 2. An individual device such as a 2N3904 etc. can be used for Q\ :sub:`4` in figure 2. The 3 to 1 emitter area ratio will result in an output voltage very nearly 1.2 volts if R\ :sub:`1` and R\ :sub:`3` are both equal to 2 K? (when R\ :sub:`2` is 100?).
