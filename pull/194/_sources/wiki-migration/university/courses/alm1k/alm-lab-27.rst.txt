Activity: TTL inverter and NAND gate, For ADALM1000
===================================================

Objectives:
-----------

A variety of digital logic circuit techniques have been in use since the 1960s, when integrated logic gates were first produced. In this Lab activity, the Transistor Transistor Logic (TTL) circuit inverter (NOT gate) and 2 input NAND gate configurations are examined.

Notes:
------

As in all the ALM labs we use the following terminology when referring to the connections to the M1000 connector and configuring the hardware. The green shaded rectangles indicate connections to the M1000 analog I/O connector. The analog I/O channel pins are referred to as CA and CB. When configured to force voltage / measure current –V is added as in CA-V or when configured to force current / measure voltage –I is added as in CA-I. When a channel is configured in the high impedance mode to only measure voltage –H is added as CA-H.

In this Lab you will be using the channels of the ALM1000 in the split Input / Output mode. For eample CB-Out is used to denote the connection to the Output pin and CB-In is used to denote the Input pin on the (expanded) 8 pin connector.

Scope traces are similarly referred to by channel and voltage / current. Such as CA-V , CB-V for the voltage waveforms and CA-I , CB-I for the current waveforms.

Background:
-----------

The schematic of a Transistor Transistor Logic (TTL) inverter is shown in figure 1. This circuit overcomes the limitations of the single transistor inverter circuit. The basic TTL inverter consists of three stages. A current steering input, a phase splitting stage and an output driver stage.

   Figure 1 TTL Inverter


The input stage transistor Q\ :sub:`1` performs a current steering function. It can be thought of as a back-to-back diode arrangement. The transistor is operated in either forward or reverse mode to steer current to or from the second stage transistor's base, Q\ :sub:`2`. The forward current gain or ß\ :sub:`F`, is much larger than the reverse ß\ :sub:`R`. it provides a higher discharge current to discharge the base when turning it off.

   Figure 2 Equivalent circuit of input current steering stage


Second stage transistor, Q\ :sub:`2` in figure 1, is a phase splitter to drive both halves of the pull up and pull down output stage. It allows the input condition to be produced in opposite phases so that the output transistors can be driven in anti-phase. This allows Q\ :sub:`3` to be on when Q\ :sub:`4` is off and vice versa as shown in figure 3.

   Figure 3 Phase splitting stage


The output transistor pair, Q\ :sub:`3` and Q\ :sub:`4` along with diode D\ :sub:`1` are referred to as a totem-pole output as shown in figure 4. This output configuration provides the ability to both actively source or sink current and is useful for driving capacitive loads. Resistor R\ :sub:`4`, serves to limit the current available from V\ :sub:`CC`. Under steady-state conditions, only one transistor is on at a time.

   Figure 4 Output Stage


The diode, D\ :sub:`1`, serves to increase the effective turn on voltage of Q\ :sub:`4` which allows it to be turned off before Q\ :sub:`3`\ turns fully on. This helps prevent potentially large surge currents from flowing in the output stage during transitions between logic states. Resistor R\ :sub:`4` also serves to limit the current that is allowed to flow in the output stage. The disadvantage is that the logic high voltage is reduced by an amount of the diode drop as shown in figure 6.

Measurements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Transfer Characteristic:**

The transfer characteristic can be deduced by applying a slowly ramping input voltage and determining the sequence of events which takes place with respect to changes in the states of conduction of each transistor and the critical points at which the onset of these changes happen. Consider the circuit input vs. output transfer characteristic curve shown in figure 6.

   Figure 6 TTL inverter input vs output transfer curve


**Break Point P1**

With the input near 0 volts and the base current supplied to Q\ :sub:`1`, this transistor can conduct in the forward mode. Since the only source of collector current is the leakage of Q\ :sub:`2` , Q\ :sub:`1` will be driven into saturation. This ensures that Q\ :sub:`2` is off which, in turn, means that Q\ :sub:`3` is off. While there is no load present, there are leakage currents flowing in the output stage which allow the transistor Q\ :sub:`4` and the diode D\ :sub:`1` to be barely conducting in the ON state.

**V\ OUT = V\ CC - V\ BE4 - V\ D1** **V\ OUT = 5 - 0.6 - 0.6 = 3.8V** **Point P1: V\ IN = 0.5, V\ OUT = 3.8V**

**Break Point P2**

As the input voltage is slightly increased, the above state continues until, with Q\ :sub:`1` on and in saturation, the voltage at the base of Q\ :sub:`2` rises to the point of conduction. Then:

**V\ IN = V\ BE2 - V\ CE1(SAT) = 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5** **Point P2: V\ IN = 0.5, V\ OUT = 3.8V**

**Break Point P3**

As the input voltage is further increased, Q\ :sub:`2` becomes more conducting, turning fully ON. Base current to Q\ :sub:`2` is supplied by the now forward biased base-collector junction of Q\ :sub:`1` which is still in saturation. Eventually, Q\ :sub:`3` reaches the point of conduction. This happens when:

**V\ IN = V\ BE2 + V\ BE3 - V\ CE1(SAT)** **V\ IN = 0.7 + 0.6 - 0.1 = 1.2V**

Note that with transistor Q\ :sub:`3` just at turn on, V\ :sub:`BE3` = 0.6V which means that the current through R\ :sub:`3` is 0.6V/470Ω = 1.27mA. With operation in the linear active region, the collector current in Q\ :sub:`2` is 0.97 × 1.27mA = 1.23mA. ˜ a\ :sub:`F` I\ :sub:`E2`

The voltage drop across R\ :sub:`2` is then V\ :sub:`R2` = 1.23mA × 2.2 kΩ = 2.7V.

Under this condition the collector to emitter voltage drop across Q\ :sub:`2` is:

**V\ CE2 = V\ CC - V\ R2 - V\ R3** **V\ CE2 = 5 - 2.7 - 0.6 = 1.7V**

This confirms that Q\ :sub:`2` is still operating in the forward active mode.

With Q\ :sub:`3` beginning to conduct there is a conduction path for current through Q\ :sub:`4` and the diode, D\ :sub:`1`, which then turns fully ON. In this case:

**V\ O = V\ CC - V\ R1 - V\ BE4 - V\ D1** **V\ O = 5 - 0.94 - 0.65 - 0.6 = 2.81V** **Point 3: V\ i = 1.2V, V\ O = 2.81V**

**Break Point P4**

As the input voltage is further increased, Q\ :sub:`2` conducts more heavily, eventually saturating. Q\ :sub:`3` also conducts more heavily and eventually reaches the point of saturation also. As Q\ :sub:`2` becomes more conducting, its collector current increases. This in turn increases the voltage drop across R\ :sub:`1` which in turn means that the voltage across Q\ :sub:`2` i.e. V\ :sub:`CE2` drops. This falls below the requirement for conduction in Q\ :sub:`4` and the diode, D\ :sub:`1`, so that both of these turn OFF prior to the saturation of Q\ :sub:`3`.

When Q\ :sub:`3` reaches the edge of saturation:

**V\ i = V\ BE2 + V\ BE3 - V\ CE1** **V\ i = 0.7 + 0.7 - 0.1 = 1.5V** **Point 4: V\ i = 1.4V, V\ O = 0.2V**

Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~

The output circuitry of a typical TTL logic gate is commonly referred to a totem-pole output because the two output transistors are stacked one above the other like carvings on a totem pole. Is a gate circuit with a totem-pole output stage able to source load current, sink load current, or do both?
