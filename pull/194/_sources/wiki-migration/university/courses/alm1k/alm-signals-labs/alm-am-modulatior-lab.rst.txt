Activity: Amplitude Modulators
==============================

Objective:
----------

The objective of this activity is to construct an Amplitude Modulator circuit
using an NPN transistor differential amplifier.

Notes:
------

As in all the ALM labs we use the following terminology when referring to the connections to the M1000 connector and configuring the hardware. The green shaded rectangles indicate connections to the M1000 analog I/O connector. The analog I/O channel pins are referred to as CA and CB. When configured to force voltage / measure current –V is added as in CA-V or when configured to force current / measure voltage –I is added as in CA-I. When a channel is configured in the high impedance mode to only measure voltage –H is added as CA-H. Scope traces are similarly referred to by channel and voltage / current. Such as CA-V , CB-V for the voltage waveforms and CA-I , CB-I for the current waveforms.

Background:
-----------

An AM modulator can be constructed by varying the tail current of an NPN
differential amplifier as a variable transconductance amplifier. The
transconductance of Q1 and Q2 in figure 1 varies directly and linearly versus
the emitter current as set by Q3. The higher the current from Q3, the higher the
transconductances of Q1 and Q2 and the higher the signal gain that Q1 and Q2
provide.

   Figure 1, The transconductance amplifier as AM modulator

In simulation Q1 and Q2 will be parametrically identical and track each other
over temperature and the circuit will have no offset or gain errors. However,
attempting to make this circuit using discrete transistors, (2N3904 for example)
will not perform as well as it does in simulation. Discrete devices do not
parametrically match or track each other so the current split between the
differential pair will be extremely unstable versus temperature. This is why
integrated circuits perform much better, where all the devices constructed on
the same silicon substrate will be at the same temperature and have matching
electrical parameters.

In an improved discrete implementation, shown in figure 2, Q1 and Q2 operate as
a differential pair. However, unlike the conventional differential pair of
figure 1, where the emitters of the pair are directly connected together, the
emitters are capacitively coupled to each other. Additionally, different than
the standard differential pair, Q1 and Q2 each have their own current sources,
Q3 and Q4, rather than sharing a single current source. The two tail current
sources are generally considered to be thermally at the same temperature. If Q1,
Q2 and Q3, Q4 are parametrically slightly mismatched versus temperature, it will
not cause significant errors in the single-ended AM output below 100%
modulation.

   Figure 2, The AM modulator simulation circuit

From the above circuit, we see the following SPICE results. The op-amp, U1,
converts the differential signal seen at the collectors of Q1 and Q2 into a
single-ended signal at AMoutput.

In Figure 3, the carrier signal from source VC appears differentially at the
collectors of Q1 (V(n001)) and Q2 (V(n003)) with no modulation signal applied
from source VM. Note that the collector signals are 180° out of phase with
respect to each other.

   Figure 3, Carrier signals with no modulation applied

In figure 4, with no carrier signal applied from source VC, the modulating
signal from source VM shows up as common mode (zero differential signal) at the
collectors of Q1 and Q2. The collector signals are at zero degrees phase angle
with respect to each other.

If we turn on both the carrier and modulation signals, in figure 5, the result
is the amplitude modulated carrier with the modulating signal itself getting
cancelled out in that subtraction.

Procedure
---------

Sine waves are generally used for the Carrier and Modulation signals in this
activity.

The amplitude of the Carrier signal, VC in figure 2, is small. AWG channel A is
AC coupled to the circuit so the DC level is unimportant so we can set the Min
and Max values most anywhere as long as they are only around 100 mV apart.
Centering on the 2.5 V middle of the supply range is advisable. A Min value of
2.45 and a Max value of 2.55 are good starting values. The Carrier frequency
should be set to 20 KHz.

The amplitude of the Modulation signal, VM in figure 2, is larger and the AWG
channel B is also AC coupled to the circuit. The Modulation frequency should be
set to 100 Hz. While observing the modulated AMoutput signal with AIN in the
Split I/O mode, adjust the difference between the Channel B Min and Max values
until the modulation level approaches 100 % similar to that shown in figure 5.

Try increasing the amplitude of the Carrier signal. How does it affect the
modulation level seem in the output? Is there a point beyond which there is no
affect?

Modifications for operation at high frequency
---------------------------------------------

Using an active operational amplifier to convert the differential signal to a
single ended signal at radio frequencies is impractical and a transformer is
more often used as we see in figure 7. Here two of the six windings in a
HPH1-1400L are used as the collector loads. The remaining 4 windings are
connected in series to form the secondary winding.

   Figure 7, Tuned LC load, AM modulator

By using the inductance of the coil with capacitor C5, a parallel resonate or
tuned load can be implemented. The LC resonate frequency is tuned to be equal to
the carrier frequency. In the case of the 200 uH coil inductance and a 20 KHz
carrier frequency C5 is set to 80 nF. Because of device tolerances the exact
resonance might fall at a slightly different frequency. You should observe the
amplitude of the AM output signal as you adjust (sweep) the frequency of the
Carrier either side of where you calculate the resonance to happen. Find the
frequency that results in the highest amplitude output. That will be the
resonate frequency of the modulator.
