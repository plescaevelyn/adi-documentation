Recording a macro and generating scripts
========================================

ACE has a feature called Macro Tools to record configuration and device
interaction steps by putting them into a file called a Macro. Once a Macro is
generated using the Macro Tools feature, it can then be called again thereby
repeating the steps performed in one go. Following steps explain how to generate
a macro.

-  Open ACE, then go to Tools -> Macro Tools.

-  Start performing device interaction such as changing parameters, inputting values to registers on the memorymap, capturing data etc. The 'Commands' windows will fill up as the GUI is navigated and interacted with.
-  Once all parameters to be entered are recorded, hit the 'stop recording macro
   commands' button. Same location as above.

Once a macro file has been recorded, it can then be stored into a macro file and
played again to repeat the previously performed steps.

Additionally, ACE has a built in feature to then generate scripts that perform
the recorded actions in a supported language of choice.

-  Click on the Generate icon at the right to open the script generator window.

-  Select the desired language among C#, MATLAB or Python

The Remote API DLL
==================

Apart from supported languages, the remote API can also be used by IDEs that
support DLLs like LabVIEW. The DLL is located in the ACE installation directory
within the subfolder "Clients".
