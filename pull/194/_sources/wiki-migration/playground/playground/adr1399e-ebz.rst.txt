**EVALUATION KIT CONTENTS** ADR1399E-EBZ

**EQUIPMENT NEEDED** USB-C Compatible charger / power supply, or Benchtop Lab Supply Several Digit DMM (such as HP3458 or Keithley 2001) Two banana plug cables, or One SMA to meter-compatible cable

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION** The ADR1399E-EBZ allows the evaluation of the ADR1399KEZ, ultra-stable 7.05V Shunt Voltage Reference in 8-Pin LCC package.

The DUT is on a paddle shaped "island" area of PCB for less stress from board
flexure and also for thermal isolation. It is inside a captive acrylic enclosure
to reduce air flow and further improve thermal isolation. Ground planes are
removed under the DUT except for a hatch ground on the bottom side, again to
prevent excessive thermal conduction away from the oven-ized reference.

Isolated power means that the Reference output is effectively floated, removing
the likelihood of ground loops. The isolation is bridged only by a 1Meg
resistor. Power may be supplied via the USB-C cable, or 5V may be applied to
“VUSB”, or power may be back driven onto the regulator outputs at “VPRE” or
“V+”. The ultra-stable 7.05V is brought out to both banana jacks and to an edge
mounted SMA connector.

EVALUATION BOARD QUICK START PROCEDURES

The following sections outline the basic prepopulated configuration of the
ADR1399E-EBZ required to test the basic functionality of the device.

POWER SUPPLY CONSIDERATION Use a USB-C charger or other USB-C source to power
the board. You should see a Green LED. Alternately, 5V can be applied between
VUSB and DGND from a bench supply. This will power the isolating LMT8048 module,
providing isolated power downstream. Alternately, the LTM8048 internal regulator
can be back driven at VPRE/AGND (Max 20V). AGND is the Reference ground, so this
approach is not isolated.

INITIAL BOARD CONFIGURATION The ADR1399E-EBZ comes pre-configured. There are no
jumpers or other settings. Just power the board using (only) one of the methods
described above, and begin watching the 7.05V output at either the SMA output or
the Banana jacks (or both). For the best investigation, you will need a 6-digit
or higher meter, such as HP3458 or Keithley 2001/2 or equivalent.

USING THE EVALUATION BOARD FOR TESTING The board was designed along the lines of
a simple “pocket calibrator”, so alternate means of supplying the DUT were not
thoroughly provided for. For example, the Heater- is directly grounded, so there
is no means of providing a negative 15V supply to Heater- for an overall 30V
heater supply.

The board is very easy to use. Just power the board using one of the methods
discussed, and start measuring the output DC voltage. If you measure the supply
current, you should see an initial fairly high current as the heater brings the
ADR1399 to temperature (approx. 95C). The ADR1399 has an internal current limit
of about 100mA. After losses and transformer, this limits the 5V USB input
current to about 300mA. Total current at the DUT can be easily measured by
probing across the 1 Ohm resistor R1 (at TP3, TP1).

     ESD Caution

ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Charged devices and circuit
boards can discharge without detection. Although this product features patented
or proprietary protection circuitry, damage may occur on devices subjected to
high energy ESD. Therefore, proper ESD precautions should be taken to avoid
performance degradation or loss of functionality. Legal Terms and Conditions By
using the evaluation board discussed herein (together with any tools, components
documentation or support materials, the “Evaluation Board”), you are agreeing to
be bound by the terms and conditions set forth below (“Agreement”) unless you
have purchased the Evaluation Board, in which case the Analog Devices Standard
Terms and Conditions of Sale shall govern. Do not use the Evaluation Board until
you have read and agreed to the Agreement. Your use of the Evaluation Board
shall signify your acceptance of the Agreement. This Agreement is made by and
between you (“Customer”) and Analog Devices, Inc. (“ADI”), with its principal
place of business at One Technology Way, Norwood, MA 02062, USA. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Agreement, ADI hereby grants to Customer a free,
limited, personal, temporary, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable
license to use the Evaluation Board FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY. Customer

exclusive purpose referenced above, and agrees not to use the Evaluation Board
for any other purpose. Furthermore, the license granted is expressly made
subject to the following additional limitations: Customer shall not (i) rent,
lease, display, sell, transfer, assign, sublicense, or distribute the Evaluation
Board; and (ii) permit any Third Party to access the Evaluation Board. As used
herein, the term “Third Party” includes any entity other than ADI, Customer,
their employees, affiliates and in-house consultants. The Evaluation Board is
NOT sold to Customer; all rights not expressly granted herein, including
ownership of the Evaluation Board, are reserved by ADI. CONFIDENTIALITY. This

proprietary information of ADI. Customer may not disclose or transfer any
portion of the Evaluation Board to any other party for any reason. Upon
discontinuation of use of the Evaluation Board or termination of this Agreement,
Customer agrees to promptly return the Evaluation Board to ADI. ADDITIONAL
RESTRICTIONS. Customer may not disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer chips
on the Evaluation Board. Customer shall inform ADI of any occurred damages or
any modifications or alterations it makes to the Evaluation Board, including but
not limited to soldering or any other activity that affects the material content
of the Evaluation Board. Modifications to the Evaluation Board must comply with
applicable law, including but not limited to the RoHS Directive. TERMINATION.
ADI may terminate this Agreement at any time upon giving written notice to
