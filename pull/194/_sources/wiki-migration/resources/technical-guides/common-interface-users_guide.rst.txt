Common Interface User's Guide
=============================

1. Overview
-----------

The “Common Interface” is a solution that is customizable to fit the needs of an Industrial Ethernet Device. The user may modify the Peripherals and the I/O Application to match the system requirements. The User I/O Application communicates to the Network Application using the Common Interface. This document describes what is contained in the Common Interface and the needed Application Programming Interface (API) calls for an Industrial Ethernet Device.

The Common Interface provides a single Application Programming Interface (API) to adapt, and a precompiled executable that runs as the network application for a given Industrial Ethernet protocol. Because the interface is common, a single user application can be created and operate on any of the supported protocols. The user implements the Common Interface functions in their code as needed to get data to and from the network. The Network Application is treated as a black box; users do not need to worry about the Ethernet aspect of communication.

The developer produces two elements to make up a working device. Configuration Data (created using the Configuration Tool) and an I/O application using other peripherals of the processor or to perform other tasks as required. The Configuration Data is used by the Network Application to map the elements of the I/O application to Industrial Ethernet protocols. The developer modifies the sample application to fit the needs of the device. On the Common Interface, an example workspace which uses sample configuration implements an application that echoes Output Data from the PLC back to the device Input Data which is then sent back to the PLC.

The environment provided uses the freeRTOS in the ADSP-CM408 (CM408) or MAX32690 processor(or potentially other processors). The software in CM408(Or other processor) is open source and has been widely used in many industrial fields. A single thread is made available to the user’s own application, while the others are utilized for management of the lower-level protocols/etc. The development model is similar to writing an application for a standard operating system (e.g. Linux or Windows).

The Network Application uses four GPIOs of CM408, MDIO, 16-bit parallel BUS (SMC) and the System Timer to implement the network interface. This leaves the other hardware sources, like GPIOs, Timers, ADC, several external interrupt lines, PWM, UART, SPI, GPIO, I2C and Other ADSP-CM408 peripherals at the disposal of the I/O application.

2. Common Interface Software Development Kit Contents
-----------------------------------------------------

The Common Interface Software Development Kit (SDK) is distributed as an integrated project compatible with IAR IDE (IAR ARM 8.10 or later). IAR is widely used for ARM core development. This project is the starting point for application development. The provided project is a simple example Common Interface application. Regarding this project, it includes several different components.

NOTE: It is imperative that a user not modify the .icf file that is included in the zip file as it defines the memory map for the Common Interface.

2.1 Network Application(thread)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a binary application that includes the network protocol implementation and associated protocol stack and interfaces.

2.2 I/O Application(thread)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an application that includes simple data I/O implementation example and users are expected to add their own application layer in this thread. In this application example, there are also .rpc files and a .eds file for EtherNet/IP. The user is expected to modify these files as well to fit the needs of their application.

2.3 IAR Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This zip file also includes several IAR projects. These are not intended to be modified and should just be left as part of the build environment.

::

    • libdrv40z
    • libssl50z
    • libosal40z_freertos
    • adsp-cm40x-sms-srv
    • adsp-cm40x-startup-srv
    • io-example-srv
    • potentially others depending on the build environment

2.4 Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This workspace also includes several binary files with include files only so that the user can use the API and be aware of what it is but not modify the source.

3. Application Development and Integration
------------------------------------------

The Common Interface is built around a few basic element types used to model an I/O device.

::

    • Device – The Common Interface device element is used to define the global parameters for a device with respect
      to a particular protocol.  There can only be one device added per implementation of a user application.
    • Items – Common Interface items are used to map different pieces and types of I/O from the application to the
      network interface in use. A user is not limited to just one item but the maximum IO size is limited by several
      factors including the allowable packet size on a network. Therefore the overall IO data size has a maximum of
      1440 bytes.
    • Baskets – Baskets are a higher-level mechanism used to organize items and devices into consistent groups.  A
      basket will contain exactly one device and up to 32 items, so long as the maximum IO data size (1440 bytes) is
      not exceeded.

The sample configuration that is pre-distributed with the Common Interface is as follows:

• Device 400

::

    o Has parameters specific to the protocol in use.

• Item 500 (Digital Inputs and Outputs)

::

    o Input size: 2 bytes
    o Subindex 1 (2 bytes)
    o Output size: 2 bytes
    o Subindex 1 (2 bytes)
    o Other protocol specific information.

• Item 501 (Analog Inputs and Outputs)

::

    o Input size: 4 bytes
    o Subindex 1 (2 bytes)
    o Output size: 4 bytes
    o Subindex 1 (2 bytes)
    o Other protocol specific information

• Item 502 (Control Register)

::

    o Input size: 0 bytes
    o Output size: 2 bytes
    o Subindex 1 (2 bytes Control Data)
    o Other protocol specific information.

• Basket 1000 – Contains the following Devices and Items

::

    o Device 400
    o Item 500
    o Item 501
    o Item 502

3.1 Common Interface Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Device, in terms of the Common Interface, is a single element that defines a set of protocol- specific parameters used to identify the overall device to the industrial network. The developer assigns a number (16-bits) to each device-type that the application is intended to support (regardless of protocol). The configuration data then defines all information needed to adapt that device to a particular protocol. See Figure 2 below.

The API includes routines to set the current device (set once at initialization), as well as read and write some of the “fields” of the device.

INSERT FIGURE HERE Figure 2 - Common Interface Devices

3.2 Common Interface Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An item identifies something that can be read or written. This can be a block of cyclic I/O data, a parameterization value (e.g. scale factor), or any number of other purposes. I/O data items will be mapped similarly for the various network protocols, other items can behave differently depending on the protocol. The API includes functions to add items to the device, read and write the data of items, and set and read parameters related to the items.

3.3 Common Interface Baskets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Baskets are the simplest element of the Common Interface. They are simply a collection of a Device and one or more Items. They are also not protocol-specific. The API includes a routine to retrieve the contents of a basket. See Figure 5 below.

3.4 Simple I/O Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user’s application is developed beginning from the thread of IO_IoApplicationThread(), which is created in main() at ..io-example-app\\src\\IO_main.c as follows:

::

   xTaskCreate(IO_IoApplicationThread, "IO Thread",
     2\*configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, IO_APP_BASE_PRIORITY, NULL)

This thread will then call an example of the user’s application in io-app\\src\\IO_main.c:

       CI_WaitIO();
     }

     /* The application should never get here */
     return 0;
   }

This is a complete Common Interface application. Real I/O processing will have to occur to make a useful device, but most applications will have this basic form:

• Initialization

::

    o Includes lowering of interrupt mask (necessary for proper operation of CI_Init()).
    o Includes call to CI_Init().
    o Call CI_SetDeviceType(). This will result in loading of various protocol-specific information from the configuration loaded into the network application (e.g. EtherCAT vendor ID, device type, etc.).
    o Call CI_AddItem(). This will be called for each distinct set of I/O in the device.For example, in a modular system each module plugged into the backplane would typically generate a separate call to CI_AddItem() as they are detected. The example above has a simple, fixed set of I/O. This call also results in the discovery of information in the configuration loaded into the network application including size, direction, etc. Additionally, protocol-specific information is used to properly configure the device on the network.
    o Call CI_ConfigComplete() to indicate that all items have been added. At this point the network application has all the information it needs to start up the network side and begin communications. The argument to this call is the maximum delay, in microseconds, that the application can wait during a call to CI_WaitIO().

• Operating Loop

::

    o Includes a call to CI_IoComplete(). In some protocols this function operates to update data to and from the network, in others this update occurs immediately on each call to CI_ReadItem()/CI_WriteItem().
    o Includes a blocking call (e.g. to CI_WaitIO() or to a CI timer function). This is critical - the user application runs at a higher priority than much of the network application and it must block to allow the lower priority contexts to execute.

For a basic Common Interface application, the only dependencies are on the library project. This project generates static libraries that are linked into the Project executable.

3.5 Debugging with a Network Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To debug a Common Interface application, the Network Application binary and a Common Interface Configuration must be present on the module being used for debug.

Once the Network Application and configuration data are installed on the module, you can begin developing your own application using the IAR ARM environment.

It is simplest to start with one of the provided the sample project (IO-example-app.eww) and its associated configuration data. As you begin to modify the application you can also modify the configuration data to match and load the updated configuration using the Configuration Tool.

When using the debug version of the network application, you will notice that a number of messages are printed to the debugger console between the time that the application is loaded and when it breaks at the beginning of main(). This is the early initialization and setup of the freeRTOS. From this point on, the operating system (as opposed to your application) will only display on the console when an error is detected.

The display of these messages is a time-consuming process and the startup will take a few seconds (generally about 4-5). When executing with the release version (which prints nothing to the console), startup will only require a fraction of a second. A user application can be executed with either a debug or release version of the network binary, regardless whether debugging is enabled in the user applications.

4.Common Interface Configuration Development
--------------------------------------------

This tool allows the device developer to define the device-specific parameters for each protocol (multiple devices can be defined in a single configuration). Also, items are defined to map data I/O from the application to the specific protocol.

There are three basic elements available to use for a configuration: • Devices • Items • Baskets

A device represents a product from the network perspective. It contains information like the device ID, manufacturer ID, ordering information, and some default behaviors (with the specifics varying depending on the protocol for which it is defined). While many devices can be defined in a single configuration, only a single device can be set during initialization of the Common Interface. This allows the user to use a common set of software across a range of products, by detecting what the hardware configuration is and selecting the appropriate device.

With some protocols, there is a relationship between a Common Interface Device and the configuration file used by the protocol. For example, a PROFINET device would have all the information necessary to indicate to a PROFINET configuration utility or controller what GSDML file to associate with the device. Similarly, an EtherNet/IP CI Device would be associated with an EDS file. However, the developer is free to differentiate among the protocols: a PROFINET GSDML file may be associated with several different devices (or an entire product line).

An item is used to define data-flow between the user’s application and the Common Interface. The most straight-forward items define cyclic I/O data. Other items may be used to define acyclic I/O, initialization parameters, alarms, diagnostic data, etc.

The ways of accessing data over a network vary substantially for the various protocols. Therefore, with no difference in the user’s application code, a parameter for an I/O device (e.g. a scale factor for an analog input) can be mapped to an Acyclic read/write interface in PROFINET.

Finally, baskets are collections of the other configuration elements. A basket typically contains a single CI Device and one or more CI items. This mechanism can be used to write a generic application that can support sets of items (e.g. I/O modules) that have not been developed at the time of application development. A configuration change will provide support.

Further examples of the usage of these elements are provided later in this document as well as in the protocol-specific chapters of the design integration guide.

5. API
------

This document contains general descriptions of the Common Interface Application programming Interface (API). The more commonly used functions are discussed below. For more details on the data types, function parameters and function return values, see the header files referenced.

5.1.1 CI_basket_t \* CI_GetBasket(CI_basketID_t id);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function returns a pointer to a basket. This includes a Device ID and some number of Item IDs. Typically, it would be used to define a device and associated I/O in the configuration data, while supporting several such devices in generic code. The code will request the basket and use the device and items that are returned.

5.1.2 int CI_SetDeviceType(CI_deviceID_t deviceType);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called once during initialization, this function indicates to the Common Interface what device definition to look up. The configured definition includes protocol-specific information necessary to establish communications on the network. This allows a single configuration database to support multiple device types (and multiple I/O applications).

5.1.3 CI_ItemHandle_t CI_AddItem(CI_itemID_t id, int location, int userID);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called one or more times during initialization, this function installs an item in the network application. An item represents data transferred between the user application and the network application. The item ID matches a protocol-specific description of the item in the network application’s configuration database. The location parameter can mean various things for different types of items, but is typically used to indicate where a module/etc. is plugged into a configurable device (it also allows the installation of multiple copies of a device type).

The last parameter, userID is for the convenience of the programmer. When an event is received for an item (e.g. a read request for an acyclic I/O item), the userID provided in this call is provided to the user’s application to ease identification of the item in question.

Note that for items representing cyclic or acyclic I/O, in protocols that use such information (e.g. PROFINET), the location will be directly translated to a slot/subslot number in the protocol.

5.1.4 int CI_ConfigComplete(int maxPeriod);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called once during initialization after the device has been set and all items have been added, this function indicates to the network application that it has a complete configuration and can begin network communications. The parameter (maxPeriod) is used to indicate the longest delay that the user’s application can tolerate during a subsequent call to CI_WaitIO().

5.1.5 int CI_RemoveItem(CI_ItemHandle_t handle);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called during normal operation, this function indicates to the network application that an item has been removed from service (e.g. a module has been unplugged).

5.1.6 int CI_ReturnItem(CI_ItemHandle_t handle);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If CI_RemoveItem() has been called for a particular item, the application can return it to normal operation with a call to CI_ReturnItem().

5.1.7 int CI_WriteItem(CI_ItemHandle_t handle, CI_IoStatus_t status, void \*data_p);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function writes data for an item to the Network Application. The meaning of this depends on the nature of the item involved.

For an item representing cyclic input data, this function will provide the data to be output to the network. The status parameter indicates the health of the input path (bad status indicates that a problem has been detected in the hardware). For this type of I/O, CI_WriteItem() will typically be called periodically for each set of inputs (e.g. for each input module in a modular system).

Another example is acyclic I/O. This type of I/O is typically only written in response to a request from the protocol master (controller or scanner). In terms of the Common interface, this would be in response to an event received by the user application.

Item writes can also be used to set or to clear alarms or diagnostic information, if supported by the underlying protocol.

5.1.8 CI_IoStatus_t CI_ReadItem(CI_ItemHandle_t handle, CI_IoStatus_t status, void \*data_p);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function retrieves output data from the network application. In this case the status parameter indicates the health of the output circuitry. The return value indicates the quality/validity of the returned data.

Similar to CI_WriteItem(), this routine would be called periodically for cyclic output data, and based on events received from the Common Interface for acyclic items, alarms, etc.

5.1.9 int CI_SetDeviceParam(CI_Device_Param_ID_e paramID, void \*paramData, int paramSize);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface supports the setting of several device-wide parameters. This can be used to override some settings in the configuration data or default behaviors (e.g. set MAC Address or IP address).

5.1.10 int CI_GetDeviceParam(CI_Device_Param_ID_e paramID, void \*paramData, int paramSize);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface provides access to device-wide parameters like MAC address or serial number, etc.

5.1.11 int CI_SetItemParam(CI_itemHandle_t handle, CI_Item_Param_ID_e paramID, void \*paramData, int paramSize);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface supports the setting of several item-specific parameters. The specific elements that can be changed depend on the type of item involved. Some parameters are protocol-specific.

5.1.12 int CI_GetItemParam(CI_itemHandle_t handle, CI_Item_Param_ID_e paramID, void \*paramData, int paramSize);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface provides access to item-specific parameters. The parameters available depend on the item type and protocol in use.

5.1.13 int CI_IoComplete();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface indicates to the network application that the current I/O cycle is complete.

5.1.14 int CI_GetEvent(CI_EventStruct_t \*event, short block);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function implements an event interface for the user application. It can be called in a polling fashion (if the ‘block’ parameter is zero), or, if used in a dedicated thread, it can be called with the ‘block’ parameter set to 1 and will pend until an event is available.

If an event is returned, it includes the handle of the item that that event concerns, the userID associated with that item, and the type of action indicated by the event. This generic interface can then be used to indicate that an acyclic write has been requested by the controller, for example.

5.1.15 int CI_SetSystemStatus(CI_SystemStatus_t status);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface sets the overall system status for the network application. This will be reflected in LEDs and/or network communications (depending on the protocol).

5.1.16 CI_NetworkStatus_t CI_GetNetworkStatus();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function retrieves the status of the network application and network connection.

5.1.17 CI_task_t CI_taskCreateLowPriority(void (\*TaskEntry)(void), char \*name, int stackSize);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This interface allows the programmer to spawn additional threads. These threads will operate at a lower priority than the user’s main program. It is intended that cyclic I/O processing should operate at a high priority, so it should be done in the context of the main program. These threads are intended for such things as event handling, socket management, handling of other interfaces, etc.

Note that these threads, while at a lower priority, still need to take some blocking action regularly so that other low priority processing can execute.

5.1.18 int CI_TicksPerSecond();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function returns the frequency of the system tick in the network application. It can be used in conjunction with the provided time and timer functions.

5.1.19 long long CI_RunTimeInTicks();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function returns the period that the system has been operating in system ticks (typically 1 ms per tick). Note that this is a 64-bit value.

5.1.20 int CI_GetCyclicPeriod();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function returns the period in system ticks of the current cyclic I/O connection. This function is not supported in all protocols, if not supported it returns an error indicating that the value is unknown.

5.1.21 CI_periodicTimer_t CI_CreateTimer(unsigned int period);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function creates a timer with the given period for use by the application.

5.1.22 int CI_WaitOnTimer(CI_periodicTimer_t timer);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function blocks operation of the user application until a timer created by a call to CI_CreateTimer() triggers.

5.1.23 int CI_WaitIO();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function blocks operation of the user application until data has been exchanged with the network. A timeout on this delay is set in the call to CI_ConfigComplete() (for example; so the application will continue to execute on the loss of a connection).

5.1.24 CI_RequestReset();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function causes a hard reset of the microprocessor, which will in turn reset the entire device.

7. Profinet Extension API
-------------------------

The RapID \_Common Interface API (CI)\_ is designed to provide a uniform interface on top of very different Industrial Ethernet Protocols, including EtherNet/IP, EtherCAT and Profinet. This allows an application on top of the Common Interface to work across protocols. While this works fine for many, maybe even most applications, there are sometimes needs that require deeper integration with a specific protocol. To enable this type of protocol specific work, the protocol Extensions API was introduced. It extents the Common Interface with functionality specific to a certain Industrial Ethernet protocol. This document focuses on the Profinet Extension available thru CI_extensions.h.

7.1 Extensions and Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

7.1.1 Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A class of functions provided by the respective protocol stacks within the NetworkApp. Functions defined in this table can be called by the application. Typical example for these kind of functions is CI_PnetAddItem_t function. It is Profinet specific and called by the application to plug a specific sub-module into a slot/subslot with a given API type.

7.1.2 Extension Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A class of function provided by the application and called by the NetworkApp. Typical example for these kind of functions is the CI_LedSetStatusStateFunct_p() function that provides the current system LED status to the application. It is important to understand that those calls are executed by the calling context (CPU stack and priority). Therefore the calls shall be short and crisp. • Furthermore Interrupts shall not be disabled, at least not permanently • IPC functions that send the calling thread into a wait state (e.g. wait on timer, wait on message, take semaphore) shall not be called from within a callback • Sharing non-atomic variables (e.g. structs, 64-Bit variables) with the application code must be implemented with care

7.1.3 When to install a function or callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extensions can be installed any time before Config Complete is reached. After that point in time, calls to CI_AddInterfaceExtension() will be refused.

::

       int32_t CI_AddInterfaceExtension(CI_interfaceExtension_t extension,
                                        int32_t version,
                                        void* callbackTable_p,
                                        void** ifExtensionTable_p);

This function provides a pointer to a structure that holds pointers to the extension functions - \_ifExtensionTable_p\_. before using one of the functions, the user shall check \_ifExtensionTable_p\_ as well as the specific function pointer in these structures being not \_NULL\_.

7.1.4 Extend Set Device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Ci, one of the first things that need to be set up after system start is the device type. The device type defines many data important to a industrial ethernet device, such as vendorID and deviceID values. The device type information is protocol specific. The CI_SetDevice and CI_SetDeviceCustom functions are provided to set up the device. While CI_SetDevice will take the device information from the io-config database, CI_SetDevice allows the user to pass the device type information via a protocol specif data structure. However, the default data structure to set up a Profinet device lacks specific IDs for DAP and port submodules. This can lead to a conflict with some profiles, such as the PA profile. Using the function 'CI_PNET_Ext_SetDevice_Func' from the extension interface allows to pass a DAPSubID and an individual portSubID per port:

::

       typedef int32_t (CI_PnetSetDevice_t)(CI_ProfinetDevice_t* device_p,
                                            uint32_t DAPSubID,
                                            uint16_t ports,
                                            uint32_t  *portSubId_p);
       CI_PnetSetDevice_t CI_PNET_Ext_SetDevice_Func;

Please note that DAPSubID and the portSubIds need to match the related values in the GSDML file.

7.1.5 Managing Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

7.1.5.1 CI_PNET Ext ModuleDiff CB
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The CI_PNET_Ext_ModuleDiff_CB allows a customer to fix any deviations between the list of expected modules/submodules by the PLC and the modules/submodules actual plugged in the device. It grants the user an opportunity to fix miss mismatches before startup is completed. \*Background:\* For each entry in the diff block, the function is called to compare expected slot/sub-slot configuration ("what the PLC believe is installed") with the installed ("what the device got actually installed"). This grants the application an opportunity to adjust the actual configuration to that expected by the PLC. This function does not directly influence how the stack handles any remaining differences between the PLC and device configuration. The return value just indicates whether the app was able to fix any mismatches or not. The function will get called for the expected submodules only (the configuration defined in the PLC program).

::

         typedef int32_t CI_PnetModuleDiffFunct_t (uint16_t ARindix,
                                                   uint32_t API,
                                                   uint16_t slot,
                                                   uint16_t subslot,
                                                   uint32_t realModuleID,
                                                   uint32_t expectedModuleID,
                                                   uint32_t realsubmoduleID,
                                                   uint32_t expectedSubmoduleID);
         CI_PnetModuleDiffFunct_t CI_PNET_Ext_ModuleDiff_CB;

The functions CI_addItem() and CI_removeItem() can be used to modify the configuration from within this callback. All memory associated with a CI_addItem() call is carefully removed in CI_removeItem() as needed. Once called for each expected module, a final call to this callback, called \_finalization\_ is executed with arNum and api both being 0xffff. This convenience call allows an application to clean up its configuration. It is still allowed to remove/add items at this point. If the call is used to change an existing configuration, the first call to that function or a "PLC down event" can be used to remove all slots/subslots of the current configuration. As an alternative, a list of modules no longer needed can be recorded and all module sin that list can be removed in the \_finalization\_ callback. Note on Adding Record Indices (Acyclics) It is recommended to add acyclic items only after the related submodule has been plugged.

7.1.5.2 ParamEnd
""""""""""""""""

This callback is designed to inform an application that an Application Relationship (AR) has been established and configured. No further startup parameters will be sent by the PLC. Can be used to lock certain functionality. The ARindex passed as a parameter can help to understand which AR has completed the configuration in case than more than one AR is established. Please note that adding and deleting items out of that callback will not work and will cause a deadlock of the Profinet stack.

::

         typedef int32_t CI_PnetParameterEnd_t (uint16_t ARindix);
         CI_PnetParameterEnd_t CI_PNET_Ext_ParamEnd_CB;

7.1.5.3 Adding Items
""""""""""""""""""""

The Profinet device model uses a module/sub-module concept. A module in the Profinet model is like an envelop or box for a set of one or more submodules. Data is provided and consumed by submodules only. While standard CI_AddItem() and CI_AddItemCustom() function allows to plug one module with one sub-module into a certain slot only. To allow more flexibility, the extension api adds the following function:

::

   typedef int32_t (CI_PnetAddItem_t)(uint16_t id,
                                            void *data_p,
                                            uint32_t bufSize,
                                            uint16_t slot,
                                            uint16_t subslot,
                                            uint16_t api);
         CI_PnetAddItem_t CI_PNET_Ext_AddItem_Func;

Using CI_PNET_Ext_AddItem_Func allows an item to be plugged into a certain slot/subslot. In addition, a api number for the submodule can be set. • Modules with a predefined set of sub-modules • Modules with free sub-slots and the ability plug sub-modules into a module at runtime • Allows to add submodules with a distinct api number The ability to set an api value other than the default api=0 allows implementation of Profinet profiles. The first four parameters of this call are identical to CI_AddItemCustom(), just subslot and api are added to the parameter list.

7.1.5.4 Diagnosis and Alarms
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In Profinet there are ALRAMS and DIAGNOSIS available. Whats the difference? Diagnosis provides status messages to the PLC. They are logged in the Engineering system and give the operator some inside on what's going on in the device. A diagnosis message can be activated and removed when no longer valid. Diagnosis messages are bound to a submodule and can be generated by the application and by the stack. The stack actually generates quite a few diagnosis messages. The user of the RapID platform has not to worry about maintaining those alarms and diagnosis messages. They are covered in the stack inside the NetworkApp. Alarms are disruptive events that are handled by the PLC and that may affect the plant operation. An alarm is sent upstream to the PLC and acknowledged by the PLC. Like with Diagnosis, source of an alarm may be the stack or the application. The user application shall not handle alarms that are dedicated to the stack. The details of the how alarms and diagnosis messages are formatted are documented in IEC CD 61158-5-10 "Diagnosis ASE".

7.2 Supported Diagnosis Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that while QualifiedChannelDiagnosis is not supported yet, the function parameter \_severity\_ used in the diagnosis api in CI_extensions.h follows the required coding for QualifiedChannelQualifier for future compatibility.

7.2.1 Addressing Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A diagnosis message is bound to an address based on api, slot, subslot and channel. While \_api\_, \_slot\_ and \_subslot\_ are common entities in Profinet, the \_ChannelNumber\_ is less prominent. The idea is that a submodule has one or more channels of a certain \_ChannelType\_. Examples: a digital input submodule with four inputs got four channels, one bit wide each. A analog output submodule with 8 channels uses a array of 8 16-bit words to represent its data.

Please note that ChannelType is a data width information only, not a datatype designation. A CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeDWord can be an 32-bit integer as well as an 32-bit float value.

The width of the channel is passed via the parameter ChannelType and defined as follows:

+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelType_t     | Channel Data Width in Bits   | Example Use         |
+==============================+==============================+=====================+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeOthers | Undefined                    | -                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelType1Bit   | Channel is a single bit wide | Digital io          |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelType2Bit   | Channel is two bits wide     | -                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelType4Bit   | Channel is 4 bits wide       | -                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeByte   | Channel is 8 bits wide       | -                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeWord   | Channel is 16-bits wide      | Raw analog integer  |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeDWord  | Channel is 32-bits wide      | Scaled analog float |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+
| CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeLWord  | Channel is 64-bits wide      | -                   |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+---------------------+

Finally, a channel has a \_direction\_, its either input, output or both.

============= ================================
Direction     Comment
============= ================================
CI_pnetInput  input, data towards controller
CI_pnetOutput output, data from the controller
CI_pnetIn_out input and output
============= ================================

7.2.2 Channel Error Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The error code defined in \_CI_pnetDiagChannelError_t\_ can be used to signal standard error codes as defined in IEC CD 61158-5-10 "Diagnosis ASE". The definition includes frequently used, self explanatory error codes, such as (list not complete):

::

         CI_pnetShortCircuit
         CI_pnetUndervoltage
         CI_pnetOvervoltage
         CI_pnetOverload
         CI_pnetOvertemperature
         CI_pnetLineBreak
         CI_pnetUpperLimitExceeded
         CI_pnetLowerLimitExceeded
         CI_pnetPowerFault
         CI_pnetFuseBlown

7.2.3 Severity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All diagnosis calls in the extension api for Profinet support a parameter severity. The coding of this value follows the specification of QualifiedChannelQualifier. However, only 3 values can currently be used for severity:

+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| Severity Code                 | Comment                                    | Severity |
+===============================+============================================+==========+
| CI_PNET_S_LOW                 | Lowest Severity                            | Low      |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| CI_PNET_S_MAINTENANCEREQUIRED | Error signals that maintenance is required | Medium   |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| CI_PNET_S_MAINTENANCEDEMANDED | Error signals that maintenance is demanded | High     |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+

7.2.4 Stack Internal Reference(diagTag)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameter lists of the diagnosis calls also refer to a parameter called \_diagTag\_. This tag is user supplied and shall be unique for each diagnosis sent. That said, the same value shall be used to send and to clear a diagnosis message, making diagTag an internal reference to a unique diagnosis transaction. It helps the stack to track diagnosis messages for the same api, slot, subslot and channel.

7.2.5 Channel Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel specific process diagnosis message. Channel diagnosis is used to signal process/application errors related to individual IO channels. The channel is addressed by \_api\_, \_slot\_, \_subslot\_, \_channelNumber\_ and \_channelType\_. The \_errorNumber\_ is one of the predefined values in \_CI_pnetDiagChannelType_t\_. Please refer to the Profinet Diagnosis Guideline for the latest definitions. Channel type defines the width of the channel as per CI_pnetDiagChannelType_t. Typical examples are CI_pnetDiagChannelType1Bit for digital IO channels and CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeWord for analog input (16-Bit). The diagTag shall be unique to the message sent.

::

         typedef int32_t CI_PnetSendChanDiag_t(uint16_t api,
                                               uint16_t slot,
                                               uint16_t subslot,
                                               uint16_t channelNumber,
                                               uint16_t channelType,
                                               uint16_t direction,
                                               uint16_t errorNum,
                                               uint16_t diagTag,
                                               uint32_t severity);
         CI_PnetSendChanDiag_t CI_PNET_Ext_SendChanDiag_Func;

7.2.6 Extended Channel Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Send an extended channel diagnosis message to the controller. Like channel diagnosis, extend channel diagnosis is used to signal process/application errors related to individual IO channels. The channel is addressed by \_api\_, \_slot\_, \_subslot\_, \_channelNumber\_ and \_channelType\_. The \_errorNumber\_ is one of the predefined values in \_CI_pnetDiagChannelType_t\_. Please refer to the Profinet Diagnosis Guideline for the latest definitions. Channel type defines the width of the channel as per CI_pnetDiagChannelType_t. Typical examples are CI_pnetDiagChannelType1Bit for digital IO channels and CI_pnetDiagChannelTypeWord for analog input (16-Bit). The extended information passed is used for specific use cases, where more error details are required. This includes nested errors, where an error is caused within an existing error.

::


         typedef int32_t CI_PnetSendExtChanDiag_t(uint16_t api,
                                                  uint16_t slot,
                                                  uint16_t subslot,
                                                  uint16_t channelNumber,
                                                  uint16_t channelType,
                                                  uint16_t direction,
                                                  uint16_t errorNum,
                                                  uint16_t diagTag,
                                                  uint32_t severity,
                                                  uint16_t extChannelErrType,
                                                  uint32_t extChannelAddValue);
         CI_PnetSendExtChanDiag_t CI_PNET_Ext_SendExtChanDiag_Func;

Pls refer to Profinet Diagnosis Guideline for details.

7.2.7 Clear Channel Diagnosis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the root cause for a channel diagnosis message or extended channel diagnosis message has vanished, use

::

                                                uint16_t slot,
                                                uint16_t subslot,
                                                uint16_t channelNumber,
                                                uint16_t channelType,
                                                uint16_t direction,
                                                uint16_t errorNum,
                                                uint16_t diagTag);
         CI_PnetClearChanDiag_t CI_PNET_Ext_ClearChanDiag_Func;

to inactivate the diagnosis message. The same \_CI_PNET_Ext_ClearChanDiag_Func()\_ function is used to deactivate both, Channel Diagnosis and Extended Channel Diagnosis messages. Parameter diagTag must be identical to the related CI_PNET_Ext_SendChanDiag_Func or CI_PNET_Ext_SendExtChanDiag_Func call.

7.2.8 Qualified Channel Diagnosis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This type is currently not supported\_.

7.2.9 Manufacturer Specific Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue manufacturer specific diagnosis message. Like with channel diagnosis, the error is addressed by api, slot, subslot, channelNumber and channelType. The diagTag shall be unique to the message sent. As the name suggest, this diagnosis can be use to raise non standard, customized diagnosis messages. Please note that no error code is given, the message uses a single, predefined error code (CI_pnetManufactureSpecific). The parameter usrStructureIdentifier allows to create a set of manufacturer specific messages, it's valid range is 0-0x7fff. Please refer to Profinet Diagnosis Guideline for details.

7.2.10 Alarms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alarm is a message that can trigger an interrupt on the controller. The behavior on the controller may be implementation depended. The classical way to handle interrupts is using OB40..48 blocks. Please refer op your PLC vendor documentation for implementing alarm driven interrupts. If an alarm is sent while a pending alarm has not been processed yet, the function returns CI_ERROR.

Appendix A Alarm Specifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This value is for future compatibility and shall be set to zero for now.

Appendix B User Structure Identifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like with manufacturer specific diagnosis, usrStructureIdentifier shall be in range of 0..0x7FFF. This value identifies reasons for the alarm and identifies what type of data is passed via alarmData_p.

Appendix C Alarm Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data can be passed along with an alarm. AlarmData_p points to the data and alamaDataLength gives the length of the data in bytes.

::

         typedef int32_t CI_PnetSendAlarm_t(uint16_t api,
                                            uint16_t slot,
                                            uint16_t subslot,
                                            uint16_t alarmSpecifier,
                                            uint16_t diagTag,
                                            uint16_t usrStructureIdentifier,
                                            uint8_t *alarmData_p,
                                            uint16_t alarmDataLength);
         CI_PnetSendAlarm_t CI_PNET_Ext_SendAlarm_Func;

7.3 Validate Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In CI, a event is sent to the application in case a record-item has has been read or updated. However, that is seen as too late to validate the record data and to possibly answer with a Profinet specific error code. Both validate callbacks shall not cause a context switch by calling inter process communication functions nor other CommonInterface functions. Stack usage shall be conservative.

7.3.1 Read Record Validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CI_PnetReadItemValidate_t callback allows a application to inspect whether data in the addressed item is valid or not before it is actually read by the stack. It may use the callback to update an out-of-date item using CI_WriteItem(). If CI_ERROR is returned the read will be canceled and no data is read from the item. In this case, the application has to provide valid error information using the CI_PnetStatus_t structure. If the callback returns CI_OK, the data will be read from the respective item. \_Note - it is allowed to pass NULL for this callback in CI_PnetCallbackFunctionTable_t if the use of this callback is not required\_.

::

         typedef int32_t (CI_PnetReadItemValidate_t)(int32_t handle,
                                                     uint32_t *rdLen_p,
                                                     CI_pnetStatus_t *pnioStatus_p);

7.3.2 Write Record Validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The writeItemValidate_p callback allows a application to inspect the data provided by buffer_p/wrLen for validity. If CI_ERROR is returned the write will be canceled and no data is written to the associated item. The application may capture a copy of the data using memcpy. In case of a error, the application has to provide valid error information using the CI_PnetStatus_t structure. If the callback returns CI_OK, the data will be stored in the respective item. \_Note - it is allowed to pass NULL for this callback in CI_PnetCallbackFunctionTable_t if the use of this callback is not required

::

         typedef int32_t (CI_PnetWriteItemValidate_t)(int32_t handle,
                                                uint8_t *buffer_p,
                                                uint32_t *wrLen_p,
                                                CI_pnetStatus_t *pnioStatus_p);

7.3.3 finet Status – CI_PnetStatus_t
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first four parameters represent the PNIO Status according to IEC61158-6 The "addValue" values shall contain additional user information within negative responses. The value zero indicates no further information. For positive read responses, the a 1 in addValue1 shall indicate that the Record Data Object contains more data than have been read.

::

         typedef struct {
           uint8_t   errorCode;
           uint8_t   errorDecode;
           uint8_t   errorCode1;
           uint8_t   errorCode2;
           uint16_t  addValue1;
           uint16_t  addValue2;
         } CI_pnetStatus_t;

7.4 Reading and Writing I&M Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Profinet knows 5 I&M (Information and Maintenance) records. This implementation supports I&M 0 thru 4:

+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| I&M Record | Content                                                    | Use                                                         |
+============+============================================================+=============================================================+
| IM0        | Submodule manufacturer data, software and hardware version | Physical module properties                                  |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| I&M1       | Installation location and function tags                    | Plant information where and what a modules does             |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| I&M2       | Installation data                                          | Date of installation                                        |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| I&M3       | User defined descriptor                                    | A 54 byte visible string for holding additional information |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| I&M4       | Reserved for use by PROFIsafe                              | PROFIsafe not supported currently                           |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

I&M0 is special for the device module and DAP/Port modules. These carry the device I&M0 data and can not be overwritten. For more information see [Profinet University][https://profinetuniversity.com/profinet-features/profinet-im-how-to-use-im-records]

7.4.1 How to write I&M Data via Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using TIA Portal [Siemens Support][https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/mdm/49948856?c=86913163787&lc=en-WW] or use [Proneta][https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/industrial-communication/profinet/proneta.html] instead of TIA Portal.

7.4.2 Read I&M Data Via Extension API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read one of the 5 I&M data records from the Profinet stack. The function works pretty straight forward, using just the address information as an input (api, slot, subslot). The selectIM value can be in range 0..4 to select the desired I&M record. \_Please note that the user is not informed whether the PLC updates IM 1..4\_

::

         typedef int32_t (CI_PnetReadIMData_t)(uint16_t selectIM,
                                               uint16_t api,
                                               uint16_t slot,
                                               uint16_t subslot,
                                               uint8_t  *buffer_p,
                                               uint16_t bufLen);
         CI_PnetReadIMData_t CI_PNET_Ext_ReadIMData_Func;

7.4.3 Write I&M Data via Extension API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write one of the writeable I&M data records to the Profinet stack. The function works pretty straight forward, using just the address information as an input (api, slot, subslot). The selectIM value can be in range 0..4 to select the desired I&M record. Also note that IM0 is read only, with two exceptions: 1. Exception: The value revCount For some profiles, it is required to update revCount. RefCount is updated for the given module at api/slot/subslot if a IM0 record is supported by the module. To write revCount via this api function, use a CI_PnetIM0Record_t struct and set revCount to the desired value. All other values in that struct are ignored. \_Note: To update the device I&M0 revCount, use api=0, slot=0 and subslot=1;\_ 2. Exception: If a sub-module does not have a I&M set already If a I&M0 record per submodule is desired, it can be attached using this function. However, once it is set future updates will not be successful - except for updating the revCount. Or more generally said, a IM0 record can not be overwritten once set. \_Note: Reset to factory or unplugging will clear the I&M0 records of any but device/DAP/PORT submodule in Slot 0!\_ \_Note: Reset to factory clears I&M records\_
