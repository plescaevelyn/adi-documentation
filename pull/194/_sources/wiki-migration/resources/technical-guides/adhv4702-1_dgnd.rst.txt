ADHV4702-1 DGND Level Modification
==================================

Overview
--------

This design guide is in conjunction with the PCN of ADHV4702-1, which recommends a supply range from GND to positive supply that should be less than or equal to 175V. In this guide, the DGND level modification is discussed for applications that need a positive supply voltage of greater than 175V without compromising the set supply range on the datasheet in a positive single supply configuration. A step-by-step guide is shown for selecting and calculating the discrete parts with the help of the simulation circuit result using :adi:`LTspice <en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html>`.
