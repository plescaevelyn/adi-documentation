New landing page for ADuCM350 Simulink model.

Before You Start
================

Procure MathWorks' Licenses
---------------------------

The ADuCM350 model is developed using MathWorks' products, which require
licensing. Trial licenses are available as needed.

:doc:`Go here for directions to procure the licenses. </wiki-migration/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350_licenses>`

Getting Started
===============

1. Opening the Model
--------------------

Begin by opening Matlab. The Matlab environment will begin on opening and a
Matlab command window and workspace will be displayed. To open the model, click
on the “Browse for Folder” icon near the top left corner of the window.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/browse.jpg

A modal window will open, allowing you to browse to the directory where the
model is saved. Once you’ve navigated to the right directory, click "Select
Folder" on the modal.

If you’ve selected the right folder, a list of files, including the ADuCM350
Model, will appear in the “Current Folder” panel of the Matlab environment
window.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/select.jpg

The model file should be named <file>ADuCM350\_<version>.slx</code> and double
clicking it will launch Simulink and load the model file so that you can run
simulations. Simulink may take up to a few minutes to launch. Once Simulink has
loaded the model, it will open in a new window and display some blocks of the
model. The model explorer bar, running across the top of the model view, will
show the current model block being viewed. For now, we’re only interested in the
top level view.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/level.jpg

If the model explorer bar shows that you are viewing a lower level block, click
on the “ADuCM350\_<version>” label in the explorer bar to get back to the top
level.

2. Configuring the Sensor
-------------------------

The sensor block contains the passive impedance components which model the
electrical characteristics of a real-world electrochemical or biochemical
sensor, so configuring it correctly will ensure that your simulation results are
accurate and meaningful. The sensor block can be navigated to by double clicking
it in the Simulink window.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/sensor.jpg

Inside the block, you can see the passive components that make up the sensor.
For most applications, these will be capacitors and resistors in various
configurations, however they are completely user-configurable.

You can select a component by clicking on it, and standard keyboard shortcuts
apply (Copy, Cut, Paste, etc.). Right clicking a component brings up further
options for the component, and double clicking a component opens a modal window,
from where you can edit the component's parameters.

3. Running a Simulation
-----------------------

Once the sensor is set up in the appropriate configuration, the rest of the
model parameters may be set up so that a simulation can be run. In the top level
view of the model, the simulation settings can be setup by double clicking on
the large block labelled “ADuCM350”, which will bring up a modal window allowing
you to edit the block parameters. The modal also gives some information about
the device.

3.1. General Simulation Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are four main types of measurement that can be run on the model:

-  `Impedance Measurement (Section 4) <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_
-  `Amperometric Measurement (Section 5) <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_
-  `Chronoamperometric Measurement (Section 6) <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_
-  `User Defined Measurement (Section 7) <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_

The measurement mode can be selected by clicking on the drop down selection box
labelled “Mode” in the ADuCM350 modal. Once you’ve selected the measurement
mode, please see the relevant section on configuring the simulation parameters
for that mode before continuing.

3.2. Configuring RTIA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the settings have been configured for the measurement type selected, the
Trans-Impedance Amplifier (TIA) can be set up using RTIA, which is seen in the
top level view of the model. At this stage the excitation voltage should be
configured from when the measurement mode parameters were set. If not, please
see Section 4, 5, or 6 to configure the measurement mode. Knowing the maximum
excitation voltage, the value of RTIA can be calculated as follows:

::

   RTIA = (0.75V x Z_SENSOR)/V_EXCITATION 

Where ZSENSOR is the minimum value that the sensor impedance will take in the frequency range you are measuring. This calculation gives an upper bound on the value of RTIA. A value slightly lower than this should be used to ensure that the ADC voltage is always less than 750mV (The maximum ADC range) – a safety factor of 1.2 is recommended, so if the ideal value of RTIA is calculated to be 1.2kΩ, use a value of 1kΩ (See Application Note AN-1302: 4_wire_bio_isolated for further reading on RTIA calculation).

3.3. Setting the Attenuation, Switch Mux Configuration, and Filter Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The attenuation parameter in the settings tab of the ADuCM350 block sets the
gain of the Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) in the model. It has two settings:
1 (non-attenuator mode) or 0.025 (attenuator mode).

Setting the PGA to attenuator mode has the benefit of providing greater
resolution (DAC LSB is 40 times smaller) for the excitation voltage, the
trade-off being that the maximum peak voltage of the excitation stage is also 40
times smaller (600mV x 0.025 = 15mV maximum VPK). If attenuator mode is chosen,
ensure that the maximum sense voltage is no greater than 15mV, otherwise the
simulation will fail the voltage check and an error dialogue will show.

The Switch Matrix Configuration parameter can be configured so that a 2-Wire or
4-Wire measurement is taken, or so that a measurement is taken across RCAL.

For the Filter Options, the ADuCM350 is most commonly used with both the Sinc2hf
and Sinc2lf filters enabled, though the option exists to disable the Sinc2lf
50/60Hz supply rejection filter. The model also gives the option to disable both
filters, however this option does not exist on the actual ADuCM350 hardware.

3.4. Selecting the Simulation Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the simulation settings have been configured, click “OK” on the modal to
get back to the top view of the model. At the top of the window, you’ll find a
drop down selection box which allows you to choose the Simulation Mode.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/accelerator.jpg

We recommend using Accelerator mode for running simulations on this model. More information about Simulink simulation modes can be found `on the MathWorks website <http://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/how-the-acceleration-modes-work.html>`_.

3.5. Running the Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the simulation, simply click the green “Run” button on the toolbar.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/run.jpg

Simple simulations can take a few seconds to run (e.g. single frequency
impedance measurements, short amperometric measurements), while longer or more
granular simulations have no upper bound on their run time (e.g. amperometric
measurements can run through unlimited periods, impedance measurement sweeps can
take very small increments), though for most purposes simulations should take no
longer than 10 or 15 minutes on a modern PC. Once the simulation is complete, a
plot will appear in a separate window showing the simulation results.

3.6. Analyzing the Simulation Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The plots produced by the simulations provide a good visual mechanism to quickly
interpret the results. For further analysis, the outputs of the simulation are
stored in variables in the Matlab "Workspace", accessible in the main Matlab
window. For impedance measurement simulations, the magnitude of the impedances
are stored in the "mags" variable with unit Ohms, and the phase/arguments of the
impedances are stored in the "args" variable with unit Degrees. For current
measurement simulations (Amperometric, Chronoamperometric, User Defined), the
resulting sampled current values in Amperes are stored in the "mags" variable.
These variables hold column vectors of the results which can be seen by double
clicking on the variable name. The results can be analysed further using Matlab,
or by copying them into another analysis tool (e.g. Excel).

4. Impedance Measurements
-------------------------

To run an impedance measurement simulation, select “Impedance of Sensor
(Sinusoid)” as the Mode in the measurement dialogue.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/impedance.jpg

You now have several options for the measurement. The Sense Voltage can have a maximum value of 600mV (Note that this maximum is as seen by the sensor, so different sensor and access impedance configurations may reduce the maximum allowable sense voltage – a headroom check in the model will produce an error if the sense voltage is too large). The Capture Mode can be set so that the impedance is measured:

-  At a single frequency ("Single")
-  Through a range of frequencies ("Sweep")
-  At a single frequency, multiple times ("Continuous")

Depending on which Capture Mode is selected, the sinusoid frequencies can easily
be entered accordingly. The delay time for settling can also be set. Once all of
the simulation parameters have been configured, click “OK” to save the settings.

In the top level view of the model, three additional passive components can be
seen. RCAL is the calibration resistor, which is used when making a ratiometric
impedance measurement. Set RCALs value to the lowest impedance value you expect
the sensor to take for the frequencies you’ll be measuring at. For example, if
you’re measuring a 1nF capacitor in series with a 2kΩ resistor from 1kHz to
50kHz, RCAL should be set as follows:

::

   RCAL = |2000Ω+ 1/(j(2π50,000Hz)(1e-9F))|  ≈ 3760Ω 

Once RCAL is set, continue reading `Section 3.1 <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_ to run the simulation.

5. Amperometric Measurements
----------------------------

To run an amperometric measurement simulation, select “Amperometry” as the Mode
in the measurement dialogue.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/amperometric.jpg

You now have several options for the measurement. The diagram explains the
excitation waveform which will be forced across the sensor, and its configurable
parameters.

Single Capture mode will cycle through a single period of the trapezoid
waveform, while Continuous Capture mode allows multiple periods of the
trapezoidal waveform to be run.

Once the measurement settings are configured, continue reading `Section 3.1 <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_ to run the simulation.

6. Chronoamperometric Measurements
----------------------------------

To run a chronoamperometric measurement simulation, select “Chronoamperometry”
as the Mode in the measurement dialogue.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/chronoamperometric.jpg

You now have several options for the measurement. The diagram explains the
excitation waveform which will be forced across the sensor, and its configurable
parameters.

The number of periods (E1 to E2 cycles) can also be configured in the dialogue.

Once the measurement settings are configured, continue reading `Section 3.1 <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_ to run the simulation.

7. User Defined Measurements
----------------------------

To run a user defined measurement simulation, wherein the excitation waveform is
arbitrarily customisable by the user, select “User Defined” as the Mode in the
measurement dialogue.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/technical-guides/user_defined.jpg

You now have several options for the measurement. The diagram explains the
excitation waveform which will be forced across the sensor, and its configurable
parameters. The waveform is defined by inputting a series of “Potential, Time”
points, as seen in the measurement dialogue. When the simulation is run, a
linear interpolation between these points is performed to generate the
excitation waveform, meaning any arbitrary excitation waveform is possible.

Once the measurement settings are configured, continue reading `Section 3.1 <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/technical-guides/model_aducm350/>`_ to run the simulation.
