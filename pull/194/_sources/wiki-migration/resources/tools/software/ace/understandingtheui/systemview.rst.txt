System View
-----------

The System View, shown below, shows the subsystems that have been added by the
user to the system. From here subsystems can be linked to real hardware through
the acquire/release hardware menu or removed from the system by clicking the
remove button.

Acquiring and Releasing Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware subsystems, both attached and local can be acquired/released through
the acquire/release hardware menu, see above, which can be accessed by pressing
the USB connectivity button. The compatible subsystems list contains a list of
available hardware which can be acquired by a subsystem. This list is comprised
of both attached hardware and local only plug-ins. To acquire a subsystem select
it from the compatible subsystems list and select the use selected hardware
button.

To release the acquired subsystem select the operate without hardware option and
then click the release button. Acquiring (local only) hardware will result in
the same behavior as using the operate without hardware mode. The register map
will store values that are written to it, however dependent behavior such as
changes in read only status registers will not be modelled when an attached
controller is not acquired.

Subsystem Connection State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The USB icon on the USB connectivity button indicates the connection state of
the subsystem. The color of the USB icon will change based on the current state
of the connection, with the following states being represented:

   *Warning - An Operation on the Subsystem did not succeed, or behave as expected, but the Controller

is still available and responding.

Navigating from the System View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Double-clicking on a particular board transfers focus to the associated Board
View for that board; alternatively double-clicking on a subsystem in this view
will transfer focus to the Subsystem View.
