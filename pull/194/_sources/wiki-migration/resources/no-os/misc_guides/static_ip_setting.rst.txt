Overview
========

This short guide is intended to show how you may set a static IP for network interfaces on Linux or Windows systems. For both examples we're going to be setting the 192.168.1.1 IP address for a specific network interface created by plugging the :doc:`AD-T1LUSB-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-t1lusb-ebz>` converter into an USB port.

Manually setting static IPs is required if the device we're connecting to also
configures a static IP for its network interface. Otherwise, our host won't know
which interface to use in order to communicate.

Linux
=====

You should plug the AD-T1LUSB-EBZ into an USB port and then open a terminal and run **ip a**. This will give you a list of the network interfaces Linux has created.

Next, you'll have to identify the interface which is specific to the AD-T1LUSB-EBZ converter. This may be named differently depending on your Linux distribution and other interfaces you may already have. This can be done by running **ip a** before and after plugging the converter. In out case the interface is eth0.

Now, we may run the following command in order to add an IP address to the
interface.

::

   sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0

If you run **ip a** again, you may see the network interface now has the new IP.

::

   2727: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
       link/ether 06:d6:97:8c:32:37 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
       inet 192.168.1.1/24 scope global eth0
          valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

You may now try to test your connection.

Windows
=======

You should plug the AD-T1LUSB-EBZ into an USB port. Open Control Panel and go to the **Network and Internet** tab.

Then click on the **Network and Sharing Center**, then **Change adapter settings**.

We can now see all the network interfaces created by Windows, along with their associated network adapter. Right click on the **LAN9500A USB 2.0 to Ethernet 10/100 Adapter** one and then go to **Properties**.

Then, if you double click the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IP)** item, the following windows shows up, where we can configure the IP settings. After this is done, click on "OK" a close the Properties window.
