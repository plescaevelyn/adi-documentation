System architecture
===================

ADI Reference Design System Architecture
----------------------------------------

Every HDL design of a reference project can be divided into two subsystems:

-  The **base design** containing an embedded processor - soft or hard - and all the peripheral IPs that the carrier board supports and are necessary to run a Linux distribution on the system. These designs are carrier dependent, each prototyping board having its own base design.
-  The **board design** is a direct integration of all the necessary IP used to support an FMC I/O board. These designs are carrier independent and common to all carrier boards.

DAQ2 Hardware Architecture
--------------------------

|dac2_top.jpg| |Block Diagram|

The AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ module is comprised of the AD9680 dual, 14-bit, 1.0 GSPS,
JESD204B ADC, the AD9144 quad, 16-bit, 2.8 GSPS, JESD204B DAC, the AD9523-1
clock, and power management components.

A functional block diagram of the system is given below. The system consists of
four functional partitions - transmit path, receive path, clocking, control
interfaces and power management.

Transmit Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference design generates the signals for AD9144, using the JESD204B
interface to transfer data and SPI and GPIO for controlling the part. The
JESD204B connection is done through 4 lanes at 10Gbps.

Receive Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference design captures data from the AD9680 through the JESD204B
interface and uses SPI and GPIO for controlling the part. The JESD204B
connection is done through 4 lanes at 10Gbps.

Clocking
~~~~~~~~

The system is clocked through an on board crystal (125MHz). The clock path
mainly consists of the AD9523-1 which upconverts this signal to ~3GHz, and then
divides this back down to any integer divider of this ~3GHz output.

The default reference design that ADI provides does the following:

-  Crystal generates a fixed clock frequency of 125MHz.
-  This clock is sent to the AD9523-1.
-  An internal VCO clock of between 2940 MHz to 3100 MHz. Since it includes an integer-based feedback divider, it only allows integer frequency multiplication (multiples of 125 MHz), the only multiplier that works in that range is 24, to give us a VCO rate of 3000 MHz.
-  This VCO output must go through a divider of or 3, 4, or 5, providing a max output clock of 1000 MHz
-  This 1000 MHz is then divided down to provide:

   -  1000 MHz for the DAC sample rate
   -  1000 MHz for the ADC sample rate
   -  500 MHz for the reference clocks to FPGA

-  These rates can be changed, but only based on the limitations of the
   AD9523-1, the lowest JESD clocks the FPGA will support, and the min number of
   lanes the ADC and DAC support. The JESD Interface framework understands all
   these heuristics, and configures everything accordingly.

The AD9523-1 also supplies the SYSREF signal to all parts of the JESD204B system
allowing for deterministic latency in the system.
