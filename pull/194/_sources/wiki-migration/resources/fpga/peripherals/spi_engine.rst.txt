SPI Engine

   We are in the process of migrating our documentation to GitHubIO. This page is outdated and the new one can be found at https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/library/spi_engine/index.html\

SPI Engine is a highly flexible and powerful SPI controller framework. It
consist out of multiple sub-modules which communicate over well defined
interfaces. This allows a high degree of flexibility and re-usability while at
the same time staying highly customizable and easily extensible.

The core component of the SPI Engine framework is a lean but powerful fully
programmable execution module, which implements the SPI bus control logic. The
SPI Engine execution module is controlled by a command stream which is generated
by a separate module. Different command stream master modules are available and
can be used depending on the system requirements. For example a software
controlled memory mapped command stream offers high flexibility, while a offload
core which executes a pre-programmed command stream when triggered by an
external event allows for very low latency response times. By using a SPI Engine
interconnect it is possible to connect multiple command stream master modules to
a SPI Engine execution module.
