ADI AD-FMCADC3-EBZ Boards & Xilinx Reference Design
===================================================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD-FMCADC3-EBZ <EVAL-AD-FMCADC3-EBZ>` is a high speed data acquisition board featuring :adi:`AD9625` single channel ADC at 2500 MSPS and the ADA4961 :adi:`ADA4961` Low Distortion, 3.2 GHz, RF DGA driving the converter. The FMC form factor supports the JESD204B high speed serial interface. This board meets most of the FMC specifications in terms of mechanical size, mounting hole locations, and more. For that information, please refer to the FMC specification. Although this board does meet most of the FMC specifications, it is not meant as a `commercial off the shelf <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf>`_ (COTS) board. If you want a commercial, ready to integrate product, please refer to one of the many FMC manufacturers. This board is targeted to use the ADI reference designs that work with Xilinx development systems. ADI provides complete source (HDL and software) to re-create those projects (minus the IP provided by the FPGA vendors, which we use), but may not provide enough info to port this to your custom platform.

The reference design includes the device data capture via the JESD204B serial
interface and the SPI interface. The samples are written to the external
DDR-DRAM. It allows programming the device and monitoring it's internal
registers via SPI.
