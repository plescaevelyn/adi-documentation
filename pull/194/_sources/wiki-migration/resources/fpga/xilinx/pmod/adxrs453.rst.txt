ADXRS453 Pmod Xilinx FPGA Reference Design
==========================================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`ADXRS453` is an angular rate sensor (gyroscope) intended for industrial, instrumentation, and stabilization applications in high vibration environments. An advanced, differential, quad sensor design rejects the influence of linear acceleration, enabling the ADXRS453 to offer high accuracy rate sensing in harsh envi-ronments where shock and vibration are present. This reference design allows full programming of the device, and also includes monitoring rotation angles on Z-Axis and printing them on the UART.

Two reference designs are available for this part:

-  A design which shows how to acquire data from the ADXRS453 Gyroscope.

   -  **HW Platform(s):**

Digilent Nexys™3 Spartan-6 FPGA Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extract the project from the archive file (ADXRS453\_<board_name>.zip) to the location you desire.

To begin, connect the PmodGYRO2 to JA connector of Nexys™3 board, pins JA1 to JA6 (see image below). You can use an extension cable for ease of use. Connect the USB cables from the PC to the board, one for programming (Digilent USB device) and one for the UART terminal (FT232R USB UART).

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/fpga/xilinx/pmod/pmodgyro2_nexys3.jpg

   :width: 300px

Avnet ZedBoard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin, connect the PmodGYRO2 to JA1 connector of ZedBoard (see image below). You can use an extension cable for ease of use. Connect the USB cables from the PC to the board, one for programming (Digilent USB device) and one for the UART terminal (FT232R USB UART).

   :width: 200px

FPGA Configuration for Nexys3 and LX-9 MicroBoard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start IMPACT, and double click "Boundary Scan". Right click and select Initialize Chain. The program should recognize the Spartan 6 device (see screenshot below). Start a UART terminal (set to appropiate baud rate) and then program the device using the bit file provided in the project \*.zip archive, located in the "sw" folder (../adxrs453/sw/ADXRS453.bit).

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/fpga/xilinx/pmod/adxrs453.jpg
   :alt: Programming FPGA in IMPACT
   :width: 300px

FPGA Configuration for ZedBoard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the **download.bat** script from the "../bin" folder downloaded from the github (see the links in the download section of the wiki page). The script will automatically configure the ZYNQ SoC and download the \*.elf file afterwards.

.. tip::

   If the download script fails to run, modify the Xilinx Tools path in download.bat to match your Xilinx Installation path.


If programming was successful, you should be seeing messages appear on the terminal window as shown in the figure below. After programming the ADXRS453 device, the program will automatically send the recommended initialization sequence. Once complete, it will start to print current angles/second rotation on Z-Axis on the UART.



|UART messeges|

.. important::

   Information displayed in the Terminal Screen is in Degrees/Second, representing the rotation described by the Pmod around the marked Axis in the past second. If you rotate the Pmod slowly, you will see a smaller value (e.g. 30 Degrees/Second), while rotating the Pmod at a higher speed will result in a higher value (e.g. 300 Degrees/Second). Afterwards the device will auto calibrate according to its new position, thus displaying a value close to 0 Degrees/Second.


Using the reference design
--------------------------

Functional Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference design is a simple SPI interface for the ADXRS453. The software programs the device and monitors vibrations or rotations. The information is displayed on UART.

The hardware SPI access allows reading or writing of any ADXRS453 registers via the address, write and read data registers.

.. important::

   
   -  Connecting the PmodGYRO2 to the boards using an extension cable provides ease of use.
   -  UART must be set to 115200 Baud Rate for the Avnet LX-9 Microboard and ZedBoard or 9600 Baud Rate for the Digilent Nexys™3 Board.
   


.. important::

   When using the ZedBoard reference design in order to develop your own software, please make sure that the following options are set in "system_config.h":

   
   .. code:: c
   
      // Select between PS7 or AXI Interface
      #define USE_PS7      1
      // SPI used in the design
      #define USE_SPI      1
      // I2C used in the design
      #define USE_I2C      0
      // Timer (+interrupts) used in the design
      #define USE_TIMER    0
      // External interrupts used in the design
      #define USE_EXTERNAL     0
      // GPIO used in the design
      #define USE_GPIO         0

Linux Device Driver
===================

Connect PmodGYRO2 to the JA1 connector of the ZedBoard (upper row of pins).

Preparing the SD Card
---------------------

In order to prepare the SD Card for booting Linux on the ZedBoard:

-  Download the device tree: :git-no-OS:`PmodGYRO2 Linux devicetree <legacy/Pmods/PmodGYRO2/dts>`
-  Follow the instructions on the following wiki page, but use the device tree downloaded on the previous step

   -  :doc:`Linux with HDMI video output on the ZED and ZC702 </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/platforms/zynq>`.

Make sure you have an HDMI monitor connected to the ZedBoard, plug in the SD Card and power on the board. If everything is correct, the system should boot up. If you don't have an HDMI monitor, connect to the board via UART, Baud Rate 115200.

There are 2 ways to test the driver.

-  Using the terminal window
-  Using a serial terminal

Using the terminal window
-------------------------

Open a new terminal window by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+T**.

Navigate to the location of the device and identify it using the following commands:

::

   cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/
   ls
   iio:device0 iio:device1 trigger0
   cd iio\:device0
   cat name
   adxrs450

If the **cat name** command doesn't return **adxrs453**, then change the number of the iio:device, and check again.

::

   cd ..
   cd iio\:device1
   cat name

To see the list of options that the ADXRS453 driver provides, type:

::

   ls
   dev                                     in_anglvel_z_scale  name       uevent
   in_anglvel_z_quadrature_correction_raw  in_temp0_raw        power
   in_anglvel_z_raw                        in_temp0_scale      subsystem

To read the raw Z angle, type:

::

   cat in_anglvel_z_raw
   24

To read the raw temperature, type:

::

   cat in_temp0_raw
   135
