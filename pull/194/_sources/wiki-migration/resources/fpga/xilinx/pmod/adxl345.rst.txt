ADXL345 Pmod Xilinx FPGA Reference Design
=========================================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`ADXL345` is a small, thin, ultralow power, 3-axis accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to ±16 g. Digital output data is formatted as 16-bit twos complement and is accessible through either a SPI (3- or 4-wire) or I2C digital interface. The ADXL345 is well suited for mobile device applications. It measures the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion or shock. Its high resolution (3.9 mg/LSB) enables measurement of inclination changes less than 1.0°.

Avnet LX9 MicroBoard Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extract the project from the archive file (ADXL345\_<board_name>.zip) to the
location you desire.

To begin, connect the PmodACL to J5 connector of LX9 board (see image below).
You can use an extension cable for ease of use. Connect the USB cable from the
PC to the USB-UART female connector of the board for the UART terminal. The
board will be programmed through its USB male connector.

FPGA Configuration for Nexys3 and LX-9 MicroBoard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start IMPACT, and double click "Boundary Scan". Right click and select
Initialize Chain. The program should recognize the Spartan 6 device (see
screenshot below). Start a UART terminal (set to appropiate baud rate) and then
program the device using the bit file provided in the project \*.zip archive,
located in the "sw" folder (../adxl345/sw/ADXL345.bit).

   :width: 200

FPGA Configuration for ZedBoard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the **download.bat** script from the "../bin" folder downloaded from the github (see the links in the download section of the wiki page). The script will automatically configure the ZYNQ SoC and download the \*.elf file afterwards.

.. tip::

   If the download script fails to run, modify the Xilinx Tools path in
   download.bat to match your Xilinx Installation path.

If programming was successful, the **Main Menu** will apear in your UART terminal, as seen in the picture below. There are 7 options. Pressing [e], [d], [a], [s], [r], [t] or [q] key will allow you to select the desired option. After the end of every option, all the possible options (the Menu) will be shown again, allowing the user to make a new choice.

   :alt: Main Menu
   :width: 600

**Enable Measurement** sets the ADXL345 into measurement mode. Any measurement that takes place from that moment on will be valid data.

   :alt: Enable Measurement
   :width: 600

**Disable Measurement** sets the ADXL345 into standby mode. Any measurement that takes place from that moment will not be valid data (usually 0).

**Display Acceleration** displays acceleration data on all 3 Axes.

**Select Tap Interrupts** allows enabling or disabling tap interrupts. Desired option is selected by pressing [1] to [4]. If the tap option selected is [1] or [3], after a single tap, D2 (LX9) / LD0 (Nexys3 and ZedBoard) will be ON. If the tap option selected is [2] or [3], after two consecutive taps, D3 and D2 (LX9) / LD1 and LD0 (Nexys3 and ZedBoard) will both be on at the same time. If the tap option selected is [4], no LEDs will be ON after a single or double tap.

Using the reference design
--------------------------

Functional Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference design is a SPI interface used to communicate with the device. The
software programs the ADXL345 internal registers, and afterwards reads desired
data from the device and prints it via UART. Three Interrupt signals are used in
the design: one coming from the ADXL345, one from the UART and a timer interrupt
(used for single and double tap LED signaling).

.. important::

   
   -  Connecting the PmodACL to the boards using an extension cable provides ease of use.
   -  UART must be set to 115200 Baud Rate for the Avnet LX-9 Microboard and
      ZedBoard or 9600 Baud Rate for the Digilent Nexys™3 Board.
   

.. important::

   When using the ZedBoard reference design in order to develop your own
   software, please make sure that the following options are set in
   "system_config.h":

   
   .. code:: c
   
      // Select between PS7 or AXI Interface
      #define USE_PS7      1
      // SPI used in the design
      #define USE_SPI      1
      // I2C used in the design
      #define USE_I2C      0
      // Timer (+interrupts) used in the design
      #define USE_TIMER    1
      // External interrupts used in the design
      #define USE_EXTERNAL     1
      // GPIO used in the design
      #define USE_GPIO         1

Linux Device Driver
===================

Connect PmodACL to the JA1 connector of the ZedBoard (upper row of pins).

Preparing the SD Card
---------------------

In order to prepare the SD Card for booting Linux on the ZedBoard:

-  Download the device tree: :git-no-OS:`PmodACL Linux devicetree <Pmods/PmodACL/dts>`
-  Configure the kernel to include the driver for the ADXL345: :doc:`Compiling the ADXL345 driver into the kernel </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/input-misc/adxl345>`
-  Follow the instructions on the following wiki page, but use the device tree
   downloaded on the previous step and the kernel configuration above

   -  :doc:`Linux with HDMI video output on the ZED and ZC702 </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/platforms/zynq>`. When following those instructions make sure to copy the devicetree file that was downloaded in step 1) to arch/arm/boot/dts/zynq-zed-adv7511-pmod-acl.dts before trying to build the zynq-zed-adv7511-pmod-acl.dtb file.

Make sure you have an HDMI monitor connected to the ZedBoard, plug in the SD
Card and power on the board. If everything is correct, the system should boot
up. If you don't have an HDMI monitor, connect to the board via UART, Baud Rate
115200.

There are 2 ways to test the driver.

-  Using the terminal window
-  Using a serial terminal

Using the terminal window
-------------------------

Open a new terminal window by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+T**.

Navigate to the location of the device and identify it using the following
commands:

::

   cd /sys/bus/spi/devices/
   ls
   spi32765.0  spi32766.0
   cd spi32766.0
   cat modalias
   spi:adxl34x

If the **cat name** command doesn't return **spi:adxl34x**, then change the spi:device, and check again.

::

   cd ..
   cd spi32765.0
   cat modalias

To see the list of options that the ADXL345 driver provides, type:

::

   ls
   autosleep  disable  input     position  rate       uevent
   calibrate  driver   modalias  power     subsystem

To calibrate the device, type:

::

   echo 1 > calibrate
   cat calibrate
   4,3,-218

To read the position, type:

::

   cat position
   (1, 0, 1)

The commands written above can also be used if not using an HDMI monitor and a
wireless keyboard, by using a serial terminal, and typing the commands after the
system boot-up is complete.
