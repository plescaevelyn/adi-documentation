Hardware Setup
==============

.. important::

   Before connecting the ADI evaluation board to the Xilinx KC705 make sure that the VADJ_FPGA voltage of the KC705 is set to 3.3V. For more details on how to change the setting for VADJ_FPGA visit the Xilinx KC705 product page.


-  Use the FMC-SDP interposer to connect the ADI evaluation board to the Xilinx KC705 board on the FMC LPC connector.
-  Connect the JTAG and UART cables to the KC705 and power up the FPGA board.
-  Start IMPACT, and double click “\ *Boundary Scan*”. Right click and select*Initialize Chain*. The program should recognize the Kintex 7 device (see screenshot below).

-  Program the KC705 FPGA using the "*Bit/download.bit*" file provided in the reference design archive.
-  Power the ADI evaluation board.

At this point everything is set up and it is possible to start the evaluation of the ADI hardware through the controls in the uC-Probe application provided in the reference design.

Configure uC-Probe
==================

Launch **uC-Probe** from the **Start -> All Programs -> Micrium -> uC-Probe**.

Select **uC-Probe** options.

-  Click on the **uC-Probe** icon on the top left portion of the screen.
-  Click on the **Options** button to open the dialog box.

Set target board communication protocol as **RS-232**

-  Click on the **Communication** tab icon on the top left portion of the dialog box
-  Select the **RS-232** option.

Setup **RS-232** communication settings

-  Select the **RS-232** option from the **Communication** tab.
-  Select the COM port to which the KC705 board is connected.
-  Set the Baud Rate to 115200 bps.

-  Press **Apply** and **OK** to exit the options menu.

Load and Run the Demonstration Project
======================================

-  Click the **Open** option from the **uC-Probe** menu and select the **.wsp** file from the **ucProbeInterface** folder provided within the reference design files.

-  Before opening the interface **uC-Probe** will ask for a symbols file that must be associated with the interface. Select the file **ucProbeInterface/ADIEvalBoard.elf** to be loaded as a symbol file.

-  Run the demonstration project by pressing the **Play** button.

.. tip::

   
   -  In some cases it is possible that the uC-Probe interface will not respond to the commands the first time it is ran. In this situation just stop the interface by pressing the Stop button and run it again by pressing the Play button.
   -  After starting the uC-Probe interface wait until the status of the connection with the board displayed on the bottom of the screen is set to Connected. It is possible to use the interface only after the status is changed to Connected and the data transfer speed displayed next to the connection status is different than 0.
