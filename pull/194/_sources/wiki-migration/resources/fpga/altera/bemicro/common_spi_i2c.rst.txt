The lab is delivered together with a set of design files that are used to
evaluate the ADI part. The FPGA image that must be loaded into the BeMicroSDK
FPGA is included in the design files. This section presents the components
included in the FPGA image and also the procedure to load the image into the
FPGA.

FPGA Components
===============

The following components are implemented in the FPGA design:

Load the FPGA Image
===================

To load the FPGA image the following steps must be performed:

-  Plug in the **BeMicroSDK** Stick into a USB port
-  Start **Altera Quartus Web edition** and start the programmer by selecting the menu option **Tools->Programmer**
-  Select **Add File** and select the file **ADIEvalBoardLab/FPGA/SDP1_bemicro2.jic**
-  Check the **Program/Configure** box and press **Start**

After finishing, the image is permanently loaded to the configuration Flash and
the system will start with a blinking LED after reset or power up.
