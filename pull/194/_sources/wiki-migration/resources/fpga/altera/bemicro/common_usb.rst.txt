Install the USB-Blaster Device Driver
=====================================

After the **Quartus II** and **Nios II** software packages are installed, you can plug the BeMicro SDK board into your USB port. Your Windows PC will find the new hardware and try to install the driver.

Since Windows cannot locate the driver for the device the automatic installation will fail and the driver has to be installed manually. In the *Device Manager* right click on the **USB-Blaster** device and select **Update Driver Software**.

In the next dialog box select the option **Browse my computer for driver software**. A new dialog will open where it is possible to point to the driver’s location. Set the location to **altera\\\ <version number>\\quartus\\drivers\\usb-blaster** and press **Next**.

.. tip::

   If Windows presents you with a message that the drivers have not passed Windows Logo testing, please click “\ Install this driver software anyway\ ”. Upon installation completion a message will be displayed to inform that the installation is finished.
