This section presents the steps for developing a software application that will run on the **Renesas Demo Kit for RX63N** for controlling and monitoring the operation of the ADI part.

-  Run the **High-performance Embedded Workshop** integrated development environment.
-  A window will appear asking to create or open project workspace. Choose “Create a new project workspace” option and press *OK*.
-  From “\ *Project Types*” option select “*Application*”, name the Workspace and the Project “*ADIEvalBoard*”, select the “*RX*” CPU family and “*Renesas RX Standard*” tool chain. Press*OK*.

-  A few windows will appear asking to configure the project:

   -  In the "*Select Target CPU*" window, select “\ *RX600*” CPU series, “*RX63N*” CPU Type and press*Next*.
   -  In the first “\ *Option Setting*” window change only the Precision of double from single to "*Double precision*" and press*Next*.
   -  In the second “\ *Option Setting*” window keep default settings and press*Next*.
   -  In the “Setting the Content of Files to be generated” window select ”None” for the ”Generate main() Function” option and press Next.
   -  In the “\ *Setting the Standard Library*” window press “Enable all” and then*Next*.
   -  In the “\ *Setting the Stack Area*” window check the "*Use User Stack*" option and press*Next*.
   -  In the “\ *Setting the Vector*” window keep default settings and press*Next*.
   -  In the “\ *Setting the Target System for Debugging*” window choose “*RX600 Segger J-Link*” target and press*Next*.
   -  In the “\ *Setting the Debugger Options*” and “*Changing the Files Name to be created*” windows keep default settings, press*Next* and *Finish*.

-  The workspace is created.

-  The RPDL (Renesas Peripheral Driver Library) has to integrated in the project. Unzip the RPDL files (double-click on the file “\ *RPDL_RX63N.exe*”). Navigate to where the RPDL files were unpacked and double-click on the “*Copy_RPDL_RX63N.bat*\ ” to start the copy process. Choose the 100 pins package and little endian option, type the full path where the project was created and after the files were copied, press any key to close the window.
-  The new source files have to be included in the project. Use the key sequence *Alt, P, A* to open the “\ *Add files to project ‘ADIEvalBoard’*” window. Double click on the RPDL folder. From the “*Files of type*” drop-down list, select “*C source file (\*.C)*”. Select all of the files and press*Add*.

-  To avoid conflicts with standard project files remove the files “\ *intprg.c*” and “*vecttbl.c*” which are included in the project. Use the key sequence *Alt, P, R* to open the “*Remove Project Files*” window. Select the files, click on Remove and press*OK*.

-  Next the new directory has to be included in the project. Use the key sequence *Alt, B, R* to open the “\ *RX Standard Toolchain*” window. Select the C/C++ tab, select “*Show entries for: Include file directories*” and press *Add*. Select “*Relative to: Project directory*”, type “*RPDL*” as sub-directory and press*OK*.

-  Because the “\ *intprg.c*” file was removed the “*PIntPrg*” specified in option “*start*” has to be removed. Change “*Category*” to “*Section*”. Press "*Edit*”, select “*PIntPRG*” and press “*Remove*\ ”. From this window the address of each section can be also modified. Set the second address to 0xFFF00000 and the third one to 0xFFF00100. After all the changes are made press*OK* two times.

-  At this point the files extracted from the zip file located in the “\ *Software Tools*\ ” section have to be added into the project. Copy all the files from the archive into the project folder.
