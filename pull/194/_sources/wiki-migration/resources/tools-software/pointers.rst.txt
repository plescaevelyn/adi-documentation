Free Software Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Free Software Foundation (GNU) has a large selection of documentation. Here we point out the gcc, gdb, and make manuals see http://www.fsf.org/. There are more recent on-line versions available at, which can normally be found on the project pages.

Others
~~~~~~

There are many other publishers/authors who have some excellent books on Linux and embedded Linux. Here are a few which we have found useful, and a good addition to anyone's desk reference.

-  `Essential Linux Device Drivers <http://elinuxdd.com/>`_

-  `Bruce Perens <http://perens.com/>`_ also has quite a `good series <http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=135563&redir=1>`_ on Linux topics. The one I use is

-  `Linkers and Loader <http://linker.iecc.com/>`_ is good for people interested in low level ELF/ldso details. It's available for free, or you can buy it via Amazon.

Linux Guides
------------

-  `A guide for Linux Newbies <http://linux-newbie.sunsite.dk/>`_
-  `Linux networking <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html>`_
-  `The Linux Documentation Project Guides <http://tldp.org/guides.html>`_

The Linux Documentation Project
-------------------------------

The `Linux Documentation Project <http://tldp.org>`_ (LDP) create and distribute the canonical set of free GNU/Linux documentation. While GNU/Linux applications and utilities may come with their own documentation, LDP documentation fills in the numerous gaps.

The hundreds of existing LDP documents present both overviews and details of: the GNU/Linux Operating System, System Administration, Hardware, Networks, Servers, GUIs, Programming, Language Support, etc. Not every important topic is currently covered so LDP is always seeking new authors to fill in the gaps.

The LDP publishes various types of documentation:

-  `HOWTOs <http://tldp.org/docs.html#howto>`_ - subject-specific help
-  `Guides <http://tldp.org/guides.html>`_ - longer, in-depth books
-  `FAQs <http://tldp.org/docs.html#faq>`_ - Frequently Asked Questions
-  `man pages <http://tldp.org/docs.html#man>`_ - help on individual commands
-  `Linux Gazette <http://tldp.org/docs.html#lg>`_ - online magazine

Man Pages
---------

Another important source of information is the man (for manual) page system which is an online documentation system that comes with the typical Linux distribution. For example, let's say you want to find out about shell scripting with the bash shell. Then you merely enter at the command line: man bash and you'll get a a document about bash displayed on the console. The typical Linux distribution also comes with documentation in other directories such as:

::

   *''/usr/doc''
   *''/usr/src/linux/Documentation''
   *''/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc''

An embedded Linux system must save space so some or all of this documentation may be unavailable on the embedded system itself, but some may be available elsewhere e.g. On a CD that came with the embedded version.

Journals and Magazines
----------------------

There are also paper-based and web-based journals. Here we mention two that come in both media and are very good:

-  `The Linux Journal <http://www.linuxjournal.com/>`_
-  `Linux Magazine <http://www.linux-mag.com/>`_
