GNU Radio and IIO Devices: gr-iio
=================================

GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios or other generic processing. This articles focuses on using IIO based devices like PlutoSDR, `AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ <https://wiki.analog.com/../../eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz>`_, `AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ <https://wiki.analog.com/../../eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms3-ebz>`_, `AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ <https://wiki.analog.com/../../eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms4-ebz>`_, `ARRADIO <https://wiki.analog.com/../../eval/user-guides/arradio>`_\ and `AD-FMCOMMS5-EBZ <https://wiki.analog.com/../../eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms5-ebz>`_ within GNU Radio itself. This support is currently provided in an out-of-tree (OOT) module called **gr-iio**.

.. warning::

   If you are using gnuradio 3.10 or newer gr-iio is already provided within the base install of gnuradio itself. 3.9 is not supported in any form by gr-iio.


Linux Installation
==================

Dependencies
------------

gr-iio requires a few main dependencies:

-  :doc:`libiio </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio>`
-  :git-libad9361-iio:`libad9361 <libad9361-iio>`
-  GNU Radio and its development packages
-  swig (Optional for python support)

Since GNU Radio can come from many different sources and with many different packages includes we will try to cover all the necessary dependencies but this can differ depending on OS packaging. If you have built and installed gnuradio from source yourself you should be good to go. Otherwise, consult the `GNU Radio Wiki <https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR>`_ for further documentation on the development installation.

Most dependencies do have pre-built binaries available on github (`libiio <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases>`_, `libad9361 <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libad9361-iio/releases>`_) or can be build from source as below.

Download and build libiio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libiio requires the following packages:

-  libxml2
-  libxml2-dev
-  bison
-  flex
-  cmake
-  git
-  libaio-dev

Install with apt:

::

   (sudo) apt install libxml2 libxml2-dev bison flex cmake git libaio-dev libboost-all-dev

If you want the documentation for the C API you will require doxygen:

::

   (sudo) apt install doxygen

If you want the USB backend add libusb support:

::

   (sudo) apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev

If you want zeroconf add avahi support:

::

   (sudo) apt install libavahi-common-dev libavahi-client-dev

Build and install libiio from source:

::

   git clone :git-libiio:`libiio` -b v0.25
   cd libiio
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON
   make
   sudo make install
   cd ../..

Download and build libad9361-iio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build and install libiio from source:

::

   git clone :git-libad9361-iio:`libad9361-iio`
   cd libad9361-iio
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON
   make
   sudo make install
   cd ../..

GNU Radio and gr-iio
--------------------

If you did not install libiio from source you will need the following packages as well:

-  bison
-  flex
-  cmake
-  git
-  libgmp-dev

Install with apt:

::

   (sudo) apt install bison flex cmake git libgmp-dev

For GNU Radio 3.7+ to enable python support requires swig:

::

   (sudo) apt install swig

GNU Radio 3.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   We would highly recommend upgrading to gr-3.8+. gr-iio was accepted into :git-gr-iio mainline gnuradio:`gr-iio mainline gnuradio` and will be directly provided with it from 3.10+


On Ubuntu 16.04 or newer GNU Radio can be installed from the package management. The installed version should be compatible with the gr-iio package build from source. Libiio and gr-iio may also be available from the package management, but to get the latest and most feature complete work, it’s recommend to build it from the latest github sources.

::

   git clone :git-gr-iio:`gr-iio`
   cd gr-iio
   cmake .
   make
   sudo make install
   cd ..
   sudo ldconfig

GNU Radio 3.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since GNU Radio 3.8 is not fully mainstream across package managers 3.8+ support requires a non-master branch, specifically upgrade-3.8. To get GNU Radio 3.8+ consult the `GNU Radio wiki <https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR#Ubuntu_PPA_Installation>`_.

gr-iio in 3.8+ requires liborc-dev

::

   (sudo) apt install liborc-dev

Build and install gr-iio from source:

::

   git clone -b upgrade-3.8 :git-gr-iio:`gr-iio`
   cd gr-iio
   cmake .
   make
   sudo make install
   cd ..
   sudo ldconfig

GNU Radio 3.8.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GNU Radio 3.8.2 is already installed on the latest Kuiper version, but if for some reason you have to install it, here is how:

::

   apt-get update
   apt install gnuradio -y
   ldconfig

Post installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For 3.7, GNU Radio will recommend you include ``/usr/local/lib${type}/python${PYVER}/site-packages/gnuradio`` or ``/usr/local/lib${type}/python${PYVER}/dist-packages/gnuradio`` in your PYTHONPATH during installation. If this is not the case you will need to modify the cmake command for the gr-iio configuration above with:

::

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .

For 3.7, certain binary installs of GNU Radio, python binding are placed in a competing folder to GNU Radio's built-in blocks. This may require you to manually copy blocks between the /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib. If you receive import error for iio_swig this is likely the case. To remedy this move the blocks between the necessary folders:

::

   cp -r /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnuradio/iio /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnuradio/

This is due to the iio python blocks being placed in the gnuradio subfolder. This is required since the iio language binding for python would overwrite these blocks.

For 3.8, make sure the gr-iio swig interface is on your PYTHONPATH. Otherwise, you will get import errors in python. The common command would be (depending on OS and install location):

::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python{PYTHON VERSION}/{site or dist}-packages

The added path is the location of the newly installed **iio** folder.

For 3.8.2 no additional steps have to be taken

On the latest ADI image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GNU Radio and the gr-iio blocks are installed by default. If you want to install GNU Radio on your host consult the official `GNURadio Wiki <https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGRFromSource>`_.

Windows Support
===============

The current recommended way to use GNU Radio under Windows is with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). To install WLS follow the instructions from Microsoft here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 . Please install Ubuntu when selecting an operating system. Note that GR 3.7 has only been tested on WSL.

Once Ubuntu is up and running go to :doc:`GNU Radio install </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/gnuradio>` section above and proceed with "the preferred way" install, which will be much faster than pybombs.

Once all the blocks are installed an X11 server will need to be install on Windows itself so we can use GNU Radio's GUI tools. Download and install `Xming <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/>`_ in Windows.

Next back in Ubuntu, add the following to your .bashrc file:

::

   DISPLAY=:0.0
   export DISPLAY

Then in Ubuntu source the file with command ``source ~/.bashrc``

Next, launch Xming in Windows which should only add an icon to your taskbar tray.

Finally, launch GNU Radio Companion from Ubuntu with command ``gnuradio-companion``\ This should launch the familar GUI for GNU Radio.

Native

A complete GNU Radio installer with gr-iio support is provided for :doc:`Windows 7/10 </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/gnuradio_windows>`. Please read the entire linked page before installing.

Blocks
======

Using the FMCOMMS-2/3/4 blocks
------------------------------

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/linux-software/fmcomms234.grc.png
   :align: center

.. note::

   Although the GNU Radio block is called "FMCOMMS-2", it will work with the any of the AD-FMCOMMS[234], ADRV9361, ADRV9364, ADRV9363 or ARRADIO boards. The FMCOMMS-2 IIO blocks can run over the IP network or USB. By setting the "IIO context URI" parameter to the IP address of the target board, you can stream samples from/to the remote board. It should be preferred when possible, as it is faster, knowing that the target board does not have the processing power of your PC.


Common
~~~~~~

-  **IIO context URI**: Set to "local:" if using GNU Radio locally on the target e.g. Zedboard. If using GNU Radio remote on a PC, set the target IP address using ip:XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (some boards like the PlutoSDR run a Zeroconf/Avahi deamon so the the URI may look like this: ip:pluto.local) or via USB using the URI usb:XX.XX.XX
-  **Buffer size**: Size of the internal buffer in samples. The IIO blocks will only input/output one buffer of samples at a time.
