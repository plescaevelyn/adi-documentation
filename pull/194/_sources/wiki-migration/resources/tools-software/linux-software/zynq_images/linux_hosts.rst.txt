Linux Download and setting up the image
=======================================

Download the file
-----------------

-  Download the relevant SD card image file from the :doc:`AD-FMC-SDCARD for Zynq & Altera SoC Quick Start Guide </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>` page. Please get the latest if you can. This can be done with wget as well::literal:`rgetz@brain:~/newest$ \**time wget https://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/kuiper/image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip*\*

   At least you can drive down to your favourite coffee store, and indulge
   yourself.

Verify the download
-------------------

-  Check the md5, to make sure you have the right file. ``rgetz@brain:~/newest$ **md5sum image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip**
   279097240dec7156ff5e15b7ce0b8a25 image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip``
-  A ``zip`` file is a compressed file, you need to uncompress it, and check the md5sum on resulted file:``rgetz@brain:~/newest$ **time unzip image_2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.zip**
   real    1m17.40s
   user    74.44s
   sys 2.11s``
-  Again, check the results: ``rgetz@brain:~/newest$ **md5sum 2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.img**
   b160453396e482234094a92134769ec6 2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.img``

Writing SD Card GUI
-------------------

.. warning::

   This will overwrite your entire SD card completely. Backup anything from the
   card you want to keep.

It is recommended to use `Etcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_ to write to your SD card but other options exist. Only the process for Etcher is covered here.

Insert your target SD card and launch Etcher. With Etcher:

-  Select write image from file
-  Select the .img file that you have already extracted
-  Select the SD card that you inserted
-  Click flash
-  Wait for the card to be flashed and verified

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/linux-software/zynq_images/etcher1.png

At this point the SD card is still not bootable. Go back to :doc:`Preparing the image </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`.

Writing SD Card Command Line
----------------------------

.. warning::

   This will overwrite your entire SD card completely. Backup anything from the
   card you want to keep.

Now that everything looks OK, write the file to your SD Card.

This will depend on your system, where your SD card installed itself. You also
need to do this as root, since normal users shouldn't be able to randomly write
files to block devices.

-  plug the SD Card into your SD-Writer. If this mounts the device (which many Linux distributions do), it is important that you unmount it.\ ``rgetz@brain:~/newest$  **sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1**``
-  Write the file (input file or ``if``) to the storage device (output file or ``of``):``rgetz@brain:~/newest$ **time sudo dd if=2021-07-28-ADI-Kuiper-full.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4194304**
   [sudo] password for rgetz:
   0+60640 records in
   0+60640 records out
   7948206080 bytes (7.9 GB) copied, 571.766 s, 13.9 MB/s

   real    7m54.11s
   user    0.29s
   sys 8.94s``\ Now, you have have that slice of pizza that you got too... :)
-  ensure the output buffers are flushed:``rgetz@brain:~/newest$ sync``
-  unplug the SD card from your PC.

Verify
~~~~~~

Since it's possible that the write process of a disk image can have some issues (if the target had a sector marked as bad, dd will not notice, and write on top of it), the safest thing to do is to run a `file system consistency check <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fsck>`_ on things. If you are unsure of how to use this tool, check the `man page <http://linux.die.net/man/8/fsck>`_.

.. important::

   Most Linux kernels will need to have a physical eject between the steps
   above, and the steps below.

-  unmount the file systems (fsck will not work on a mounted file system)\ ``rgetz@brain:~/images$ **sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1**
   rgetz@brain:~/images$ **sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p2**``. If this errors, with a ``umount: /dev/mmcblk0p2: not mounted``, that's OK. If it errors with ``umount: /dev/mmcblk0p2: not found``, that means you have no disk inserted, or did a typo in the path.
-  perform the file system consistency check:``rgetz@brain:~/images$ **sudo fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p1**
   fsck from util-linux 2.20.1
   dosfsck 3.0.13, 30 Jun 2012, FAT32, LFN
   /dev/mmcblk0p1: 158 files, 76420/130812 clusters
   rgetz@brain:~/images$ **sudo fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p2**
   fsck from util-linux 2.20.1
   e2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)
   /dev/mmcblk0p2: clean, 157918/452480 files, 717760/1808128 blocks``

At this point the SD card is still not bootable. Go back to :doc:`Preparing the image </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`.
