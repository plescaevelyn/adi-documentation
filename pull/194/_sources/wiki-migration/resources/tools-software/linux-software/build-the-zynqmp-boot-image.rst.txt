How to build the ZynqMP boot image BOOT.BIN
===========================================

.. warning::

   We are in the process of migrating our documentation to GitHubIO. This page is outdated and the new one can be found at https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/user_guide/build_boot_bin.html\


The boot image BOOT.BIN is build using the bootgen tool which requires several input files.

Instructions on how to build the Xilinx Shell Archive (XSA) handover file can be found here:

-  `Building HDL <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/user_guide/build_hdl.html>`_ projects

All further steps are lengthy explained on the `Xilinx Wiki Page <http://www.wiki.xilinx.com>`_

-  `Build u-boot <http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Build+U-Boot>`_

   -  Make sure you checkout the proper git tag matching your Vivado Version (xilinx-v2022.2, xilinx-v2021.2, ...)

-  `Build FSBL <http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Build+FSBL>`_
-  `Build PMU Firmware <http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Build+PMU+Firmware>`_
-  `Build Arm Trusted Firmware (ATF) <http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Build+Arm+Trusted+Firmware+%28ATF%29>`_
-  `Build BOOT image <http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Prepare+Boot+Image>`_

Use script to build BOOT.BIN
----------------------------

For ease of use we provide a bash shell script which allows building BOOT.BIN from system_top.xsa, u-boot.elf and either bl31.elf or a path to the Arm Trusted Firmware repository

Download
~~~~~~~~

The script can be downloaded from here:

-  `build_zynqmp_boot_bin.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogdevicesinc/wiki-scripts/master/zynqmp_boot_bin/build_zynqmp_boot_bin.sh>`_

.. tip::

   \ **NOTE: After downloading the script you need to make it executable**

   
   ::
   
      $ chmod +x build_zynqmp_boot_bin.sh
   


Usage
~~~~~

::

   usage: build_zynqmp_boot_bin.sh system_top.xsa u-boot.elf (download | bl31.elf | <path-to-arm-trusted-firmware-source>) [output-archive]

-  Make sure that Vivado and Vitis is included in the path and a cross compiler for arm64 exists before running the script. For more information about cross compilers, see :doc:`Building the ZynqMP / MPSoC Linux kernel and devicetrees from source </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-build/generic/zynqmp>`.
-  Path to ``system_top.xsa`` and ``u-boot.elf`` are required parameters.

   -  To find ``system_top.xsa``, see `Building HDL <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/user_guide/build_hdl.html>`_. After building a project in the HDL repository, it can be found inside a **<project>\_<board>.sdk** folder.
   -  See the note at the bottom of the page regarding ``u-boot.elf``.

-  The 3rd argument must either be ``download`` (which will git clone the ATF repository), ``bl31.elf`` or the file system ``path`` to the Arm Trusted Firmware source code repository

   -  See the note at the bottom of the page regarding ``bl31.elf``.

-  An optionally 4th ``name`` parameter can be given to tar.gz the output directory. (``name``.tar.gz)
-  **BOOT.BIN** and other build output files are located at the newly created local directory named: output_boot_bin.
-  This script requires Xilinx Vitis and bootgen in the PATH.

   -  A simple way is to source Vivado settings[32|64].sh for Linux:

::

   $ source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/202x.x/settings64.sh

-  When using **cygwin**, you can add the following in the ~/.bashrc configuration file:

::

   export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/Xilinx/Vivado/202x.x/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/Xilinx/Vitis/202x.x/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/Xilinx/Vitis/202x.x/gnu/microblaze/nt/bin

.. tip::

   \ **NOTE: u-boot.elf and bl31.elf** For those who don't want to build u-boot or bl31 themselves. Both **u-boot.elf** and **bl31.elf** can be extracted from the project folder on the :doc:`SD Card image </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`, **bootgen_sysfiles.tgz**.

   
   **u-boot.elf** may have a different name, rename that .elf file to u-boot.elf before using.
