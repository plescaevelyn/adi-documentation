Building libiio in Visual Studio
================================

.. note::

   Unless you really, really want to - don't do this. There are pre-compiled `binaries <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases/latest>`_ available for end users to use in their projects. If you are struggling with the binaries - :ez:`ask/complain <linux-software-drivers>`. It's the only way we understand what users are looking for.

   
   You shouldn't really need to follow any of these instructions - the instructions are mainly there for libiio developers wanting to keeps some notes, so they remember how to do things.


Build from the GUI
------------------

-  Libiio can be built using the `CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`_ build system.
   Download CMake: http://www.cmake.org/download/

-  To build libiio under Windows, you will need the `libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org>`_ DLL as well.
   Optionally, for USB support, you will need the `libusb <http://libusb.info>`_ DLL; and for UART support, you will need the `libserialport <http://sigrok.org/wiki/Libserialport>`_ DLL.
   For convenience, a ZIP containing precompiled DLLs of those libraries can be downloaded here: http://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/build/libiio-win-deps.zip

-  Launch CMake, and specify the location of the source code, and the directory where the build will occur.
   Enable the **Grouped** and **Advanced** options (optional).

-  Then click on **Configure**.
   CMake will ask you what generator to use for the project. Select **Use default native compilers** and the generator that matches your version of Visual Studio.

-  CMake will most likely throw an error, as the `libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org>`_ library is not in the compiler's default search paths:

-  Set the correct paths to **LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR**, **LIBXML2_LIBRARIES** and **LIBXML2_XMLLINT_EXECUTABLE** as shown below. Then, click again on **Configure**; the errors should disappear.

-  Click on **Generate**.
   Now, CMake generated a Visual Studio solution file in the build directory, named "iio.sln". You can open this file with Visual Studio to build the project.

Build from the command line

To test something in a loop (over and over again)
