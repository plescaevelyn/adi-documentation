HDL and Linux projects are build whenever there are new commits in :git-hdl:`HDL <tree/master>` or :git-linux:`Linux <linux>` repositories. Output boot files are structured in folders as they would be on SD card, and archived.

Master Boot partition files
===========================

.. container:: center round box

   
   .. admonition:: Download
      :class: download

         
         -  `Master boot files <https://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/boot_partition_files/master/latest_boot_partition.tar.gz>`_
         
         -  MD5 checksum can be verified `here <https://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/boot_partition_files/master/latest_boot.txt>`_
         

   
   .. important::

         
         -  It is recommended to use **master boot files** only if you really need them (for example features that are not part of any release yet) since the files may not be always in a good state. Check :doc:`Latest release </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/adi-kuiper_images/release_notes>` for most recent tested boot files.
         

   
   .. tip::

         
         -  Inside downloaded archive is a **ReadMe.txt** file describing what files you need to copy on boot partition root depending on your hardware setup, and **VERSION.txt** file containing build dates and git commits.
