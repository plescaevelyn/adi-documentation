GNU Radio with IIO for Windows
==============================



.. warning::

   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be Recommended for New Designs or in
   Production. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.



Analog Devices provides a Windows binary installer for GNU Radio with support for IIO based devices like ADALM-Pluto, FMComms2/3/4/5, and other devices. Windows is not a primary platform for GNU Radio and is not thoroughly tested, and support through the GNU Radio community is limited. For users looking to build custom out-of-tree modules, it is recommended to do so with GNU Radio on a Linux based system.

.. important::

   This old binary was removed, since we don't want people to go down a path that no one will get any support on. If you need it, build it from source.
