Vector Generation
=================

ACE includes a vector generation tool accessible from the left side menu.

This wiki page aims to show how to use it to create vectors. Refer to your
device plug-in manual on how to download them to the device under test.

Available vector types
----------------------

By default, ACE enables users to generate:

-  DC Vectors : output a constant value

   :align: center
   :width: 400

ACE also enables users to load custom vectors through different format of files:

-  Text Files : One numerical sample value per line. Values are parsed as double precision floating point values (integer values are parsed correctly). Complex (In-phase/Quadrature) vectors can be contained in one file with I/Q values interleaved or into two separate files one for I values and one for Q values.
-  Hex Files : One hexadecimal sample value per line. Values are parsed as short integer or unsigned short integer values. Complex (In-phase/Quadrature) vectors can be contained in one file with I/Q values interleaved or into two separate files one for I values and one for Q values.
-  ACE Files : Device data captures that have been saved with ACE.

Generating a vector
-------------------

The vector generator tool is composed of three panes:

-  ADD : Navigate through and select the types of vectors to generate. Add as many vectors of the same type or different types as you want.
-  GENERATE : Name and configure the vectors to generate.
-  PREVIEW : Get a time and frequency domain preview of the generated vector

ADD
~~~

Vector types are organized into groups. The two default groups are:

-  Common : containing the different waveforms listed above.
-  File : containing the different file formats listed above.

Groups can be expanded/collapsed using the arrow on the right of the group name.

Each vector type and file format available is on single line in their group. The
(i) icon, when hovered over, provides information about the vector type or file
format. The (+) icon, when clicked, adds the vector type or file format to the
list of vectors to generate.

Users can search for vector types or file formats using the search box at the
top of the groups.

The ADD pane can be expanded/collapse using the arrow at the right of the "ADD"
title.

GENERATE
~~~~~~~~

After clicking the (+) icon on a vector type or file format, a vector's
configuration group will be added to the GENERATE pane.

Here is an example for a single tone vector added:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/ace/vector-generator-generate-pane.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

All vectors have common features:

-  Name : rename the vector to be easily identifiable when used in device plug-ins. By default, the name is Vector#x where x is the current number of vectors generated.
-  Trash can icon : when clicked, the vector will be deleted from the generated vectors list and won't be usable in device plug-ins.
-  Preview button : when clicked, the vector data will be drawn in the PREVIEW pane.
-  Copy button : when clicked, an exact copy of the vector will be created.
-  Export button : when clicked, the vector data can be saved as a txt file with
   one sample value per line. Complex vectors' sample values are interleaved.

Vectors' configuration groups can be expanded/collapsed using the arrow at the
right of the vectors' names.

The GENERATE pane can be expanded/collapsed by clicking the arrow at the right
of the "GENERATE" title.

All the generated vectors can be deleted at once by clicking the "Clear All
Vectors" button at the bottom right of the GENERATE pane.

PREVIEW
~~~~~~~

The PREVIEW pane display a single vector's data in time and frequency domains.

After clicking the preview button on a generated vector, the title of each graph
will change to indicate which vector is currently previewed:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/ace/vector-generator-preview-pane.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

In the time domain, the vector data will be zoomed by default to try to match
one period of data if possible, otherwise the whole data is displayed by
default.

In the frequency domain, the FFT of the vector data will be zoomed by default
from 0Hz to half the sampling frequency value.

Both graph has a set of control buttons:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/ace/vector-generator-preview-control-buttons.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

From left to right:

-  Allow zooming on graph by clicking and dragging the mouse over the zone of interest.
-  Allow moving the graph zone of interest (panning) along one or both axes within the current zoom - i.e. time/frequency span and amplitude span are not changed
-  Restrict the direction/axis along which the graph moves when using previous control.
-  Fit the entire data into the graph.
-  Reset graph to the default zoom.
-  Allow users to provide coordinates of the zone of interest to zoom on.
-  Auto zoom based on data content.

Vector configuration
--------------------

All the vectors can be renamed to easily identify them. By default, the name is
set to Vector#x where x is the current number of vectors generated.

file with I/Q values interleaved or into two separate files one for I values and
one for Q values.

The ACE file format is the one used when device data captures are saved with
ACE. For example, you could capture data from an ADC device and then re-play
this captured data on a DAC device.

Saving the vector generator state
---------------------------------

Everything done in the vector generator can be saved as part of an ACE session
file. The session will contain all the configuration elements and ACE will
regenerate all the vectors based on this configuration when the session file is
loaded.
