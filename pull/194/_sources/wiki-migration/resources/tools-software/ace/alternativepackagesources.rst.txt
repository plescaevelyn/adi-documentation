About
=====

The ACE Plug-in Manager uses an external package source in order to retrieve the
latest available ACE plug-ins, allowing users to install plug-ins to evaluate
new products, or get the latest updates available for a plug-in which is already
installed.

Ideally, the user never needs to interact with this, but unfortunately there is
always the possibility of downtime, and since we are using a 3rd party hosting
provider, we have limited control over the timing and length of outages when
they occur.

In order to ensure availability of new plug-ins and updates for users in the
event of an outage, we have mirrored our package feed to other externally-hosted
sources, which are available below. The following steps describe how users can
add these sources in ACE to access plug-in feeds in case of an outage on the
main feed.
