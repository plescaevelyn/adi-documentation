High Speed ADC Trigger Capture
==============================

ADS7V2 Instructions
-------------------

The following instructions were created using the AD9208 evaluation board. For
other high speed ADC evaluation boards that leverage the ADS7V2, the following
instructions apply, but some of the GUI features/buttons may be different.

.. important::

   There is a caveat with using a trigger to capture in that the program is not
   set up for subclass 1 operation, so latency is not deterministic. There may
   be variations in where the capture actually starts.

1. Configure the plug-in/hardware for normal data capture. Please consult the
   evaluation board user guide for this step.

2. Apply a 1.8V input to SMA J5 on the ADS7V2 board. The input should be at the
   high voltage (1.8V) at this point in time.

3. Enable external trigger mode by writing a 1 to bit[1] of FPGA register
   0x0106. To do this with ACE you can use one of the two methodologies outlined
   here:

Option A: If the plug-in has a button to allow navigation to the FPGA memory map, then click it and modify register 0x0106 bit 1 in the GUI, as shown in the following two screenshots. Then, click **Apply Changes** to write the register in the FPGA.

Option B: If the plug-in does not have this button, you'll need to execute a macro. You can copy the following text into a new text file, and save it with the "acemacro" file extension. Then load this macro file into the **Macro Tools** in ACE and run. Note that if you're using a different plug-in than AD9208, you'll need to swap out the chip name with what you're using in ACE.

   -- Analog Devices, Inc. evaluation macro file
   @Subsystem_1.ADS7-V2.AD9208 FPGA: Evaluation.Control.SetRegisterBit(0x106, 1, True, -1);
   @Subsystem_1.ADS7-V2.AD9208 FPGA: @ApplySettings();

Be sure to click the **Play** button in the **Macro Tools** to execute the macro.

4. Go to the Analysis view in ACE and click **Run Once**.

5. Wait for falling edge (1.8V) output on SMA J6 (or wait long enough to ensure system is ready). At this time, ACE should be waiting for the FPGA to fill. You should see a **Cancel** button and the plot should not be refreshing.

6. Pulse trigger input or turn off input to 0V. Minimum pulse width of trigger
   is 640 divided by the serial line rate.

Once the trigger has been applied, ACE should capture and refresh the data
onscreen.
