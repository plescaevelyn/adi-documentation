Exporting Interaction With Hardware
===================================

When transitioning from an evaluation platform to custom designed hardware it is
often necessary to understand the state of the hardware settings or interactions
occurring during an evaluation session. ACE provides two options to export this
information.

Register Dump
-------------

The easiest way to export the values of all the registers is to save your
session by clicking on "Save Session" under the "File" menu. This will create an
XML file that includes the register settings for all of the chips in the
session. Each chip will be represented by a "Chip" element, with the name and id
stored in attributes. Each chip that contains registers will contain one or more
"RegisterMap" element with "Register" elements inside. The Register elements
provide the address and value in attributes. Other information is also available
in the session file.

Recording Macros
----------------

The actions the user takes using ACE can be recorded as Macros. These actions
will include GUI navigation as well as reads and writes to the parameters,
consisting of groups of bits, or registers belonging to devices that ACE can
control.

First, open the macro recorder from the "View" menu:

Next, you can record a macro by pressing the record icon in the "Macro Tools"
tool view. After completing some interactions with the GUI, press the stop icon
and a macro editor appears on the left. The macro can be edited by choosing
steps to skip or adding comments. Finally, the macro can be exported to be used
as a reference for the interactions that happened in the session, or to replay
in a different session.
