Sometimes we change things or you change something and ACE isn't quite right
afterwards. To get back to a fresh, cleanly installed state there's a few things
you have to do. Soon we'll introduce a feature to do this automatically. For
now, to fix up plug-ins not loading, failed updates or ACE failing to load, try
the steps below to scrub things clean and get back to a blank slate.

.. important::

   WARNING: You will lose your session files, preferences, exported data and
   plug-ins etc.

Steps
=====

.. note::

   From ACE v1.14+ you can perform a scrub uninstall using uninstall.exe

Step 1. Open the install directory for ACE and run the uninstall.exe

Step 2. Ensure you check the ScrubUninstall check box in the Components window
as shown below:

If you have any issues with this method, you can still perform a manual scrub
using the steps outlined below.
