Evaluation boards must be attached to a controller board. The controller board
is used to store and transmit the data to the DACs under test. The supported
controller boards are:

-  :adi:`DPG3 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-DPG3.html>` (Obsolete)
-  :adi:`SDP-H1 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-SDP-H1.html>`
-  :adi:`ADS7 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-ADS7-V2.html>`
-  :adi:`ADS8 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADS8-V1EBZ.html>`
-  :adi:`ADS9 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADS9-V2EBZ.html>`

Refer to the DAC evaluation board user guide to choose the correct controller
board to associate with the evaluation board.

Installation
------------

DPG Lite is installed as an option along ACE:

|image1|

.. note::

   ACE download page: :adi:`Analysis \| Control \| Evaluation (ACE) Software <ace>`\

Running DPG Lite
----------------

A shortcut will be installed to your start menu named "DPGDownloaderLite" in the
Analog Devices shortcut folder.

The Main Screen
---------------

The Main Screen is divided into two sections. The top section allows you to add
data vectors to DPG Lite. The bottom section displays a panel for the attached
controller and evaluation boards.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/ace/dpg-lite-main-screen.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

To begin, add data vectors to the application. Once the vectors have been setup,
the boards can be configured, the vectors can be downloaded into the controller
board's memory and played to the DACs under test.

Refer to the evaluation board user guide to learn more about how to configure it
in DPG Lite.

The rest of this guide will go over how to generate data vectors.

Data Vectors
------------

Adding Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_addingvectors.png
   :align: center

Data vectors are added to the main screen before they can be used with a board.
This allows the same data to be used for multiple channels and multiple boards
without duplicating the memory requirements on the PC. Data vectors can be
loaded in from an existing file, or they can be generated by the DPG Lite
directly.

Selecting Vectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To remove a vector, or to graph a vector, it must be selected. To select a
vector, click on its vector number on the left side of each vector. This will
cause a colored border to be drawn around the vector, indicating it is selected.
To select multiple vectors at once, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the
individual vectors.

Loading Data Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_loadingdatafiles.png
   :align: center

To add a data file, click on Add Data File. You will then be prompted to select
which file to load. After selecting a valid file, an entry will be added to the
Files List area. The item will initially be listed as "Processing". During this
time, DPG Lite is reading the contents of the data file, and determining certain
statistics about the file. Once the file has been read in, the Processing text
will disappear.

For each file listed, a Vector Number is displayed on the left. This number is
only used to assist you when selecting the files to load into the board. The
number will change depending on the order in which files are loaded in. The file
name of the original data file path, the file format, and number of records
(length) in the file are also listed.

For certain file types, a Resolution entry will also be displayed, to the right
of the Scaling box. This is used to properly scale an unsigned vector around
mid-scale, and when graphing the vector, to properly calculate dB full-scale.
Set this to the equivalent resolution of the file. For example, if the file
contains values between 0 and 16383, then the file would be 14-bit resolution.

To remove a data file, click on the entry once to highlight it. Once
highlighted, click on Remove Selected. To remove all the listed data files,
click Remove All.

Generating Data Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several different vector generators are available from within DPG Lite. They are
all available from the Add Generated Waveform drop-down list, which is located
to the right of the Add Data File button.

Single Tone
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_singletone.png
   :align: center

The Single Tone generator creates a simple sine wave vector. Enter the clock
frequency of the data going into the DAC, the resolution (number of bits) of the
DAC, as well as the desired frequency, amplitude, and relative phase of the sine
wave. The generator will always generate vectors which can be looped repeatedly.
To ensure contiguous waveforms over multiple loop iterations, the generator will
calculate an achievable frequency that is as close to the desired frequency as
possible. This frequency will be displayed in the Calculated Frequency box, as
well as the number of complete cycles that will be generated in the vector. It
may be possible to achieve a calculated frequency exactly equal to the desired
frequency. Often, changing the record length is required for this to occur.

If either the Clock Frequency or Desired Frequency is invalid, the box will turn
red. A vector will not be available until any red boxes have been corrected.

The “Unsigned Data” option should match the settings in the DAC. Most DAC's can
be setup to accept unsigned (straight binary) or signed (2's complement) data.

The Single Tone generator can generate a quadrature (complex) tone in addition
to the primary (in-phase) tone, by checking the "Generate Complex Data" option.
This second (Q) tone is equal in frequency and amplitude to the primary (I)
tone, but is 90° out of phase. By default, the Q tone is -90° relative to the I
tone. Entering a negative frequency in the Desired Frequency box will cause the
Q tone to be +90°.

The "Allow Even Cycle Count" check box allows the user to override the default
settings of the tone generator and allow an even number of cycles per vector.
This may lead to the appearance of degraded DAC performance, as only a subset of
the DAC's full code range will be exercised. This has the effect of distributing
the quantization noise over only those codes, resulting in degraded performance.
It is highly recommended that this feature not be enabled.

Multi-Tone
^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_multitone.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

The Multi-Tone generator creates vectors that are composed of multiple sine wave
vectors. Each tone can have its own frequency, amplitude, and phase. As with the
Single Tone generator, the Multi-Tone generator always generates individual
tones which will loop properly. In the tone list, the desired frequency and
amplitude are listed first. In dark gray, the calculated frequency and number of
cycles are displayed. If the tone cannot be generated (for example, the Sample
Rate is too low), the tone will appear red in the tone list, and the dark gray
text will change to an explanation of why the tone cannot be generated.

+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image15| | **Add Tone:** Click this button to add a new tone to the tone list.                |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image16| | **Edit Selected Tone:** Click this button to edit the selected (highlighted) tone. |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image17| | **Remove Selected Tone:** Removes the selected tone from the tone list.            |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When multiple sine vectors are summed together, the possibility for clipping
(data out of range) occurs. When clipping is detected, a warning is displayed:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_multitone_clipping.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

To correct this error, lower the amplitude of the overall vector, or lower the
amplitude of the individual tones until the warning message disappears.

The Multi-Tone generator can generate a quadrature (complex) tone in addition to
the primary (in-phase) tone, by checking the "Generate Complex Data" option.
This second (Q) tone is equal in frequency and amplitude to the primary (I) tone
for each individual tone, but is 90° out of phase. By default, the Q tone is
-90° relative to the I tone. Entering a negative frequency in the Desired
Frequency box will cause the Q tone to be +90°.

The "Allow Even Cycle Count" check box allows the user to override the default
settings of the tone generator and allow an even number of cycles per tone per
vector. This may lead to the appearance of degraded DAC performance, as only a
subset of the DAC's full code range might be exercised. This has the effect of
distributing the quantization noise over only those codes, resulting in degraded
performance. It is highly recommended that this feature not be enabled.

DC
^^

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_dc.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

The DC generator generates a vector in which every element is the value
specified in the Value box. The Value can be entered in Decimal or Hex
(hexadecimal).

Noise Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_noise.png
   :align: center
   :width: 850

The Noise Generator generates a vector with pseudo-random noise, by a variety of
techniques. Gaussian, Uniform, and White Noise types are available.

Advanced Vector Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphing Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_graphingvectors.png
   :align: center

The graph display shows the selected vector(s) in both the time domain and
frequency domain.

Time Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^

The time domain graph (upper) shows the digital code amplitude. The x-axes is
either time, if the vector is a generated vector, or sample number, if the
vector is from a data file. When graphing both a generated vector and a data
file in the same window, two X axes will be displayed:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader_graphxscale.png
   :align: center

Note that even though the two vectors are drawn on top of each other, they
correspond to different X axes, and thus cannot be compared directly.

The minimum and maximum value of the time domain waveform is displayed along the
bottom of the graph. These values are useful in ensuring the waveform does not
clip.

Frequency Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The frequency domain graph (lower), displays the amplitude versus frequency
graph of the data. The x-axes displays the absolute frequency for generated
vectors, or the relative frequency for data file vectors. The y-axes displays
results in dB of Full Scale for generated vectors, and raw code values for data
files.

The coupling mode can be selected by the control on the bottom of the graph. For
most operations, AC is the preferred choice. For unsigned vectors, this will
make no difference. For signed vectors, selecting AC will subtract the vector's
average value from each individual point.

Graphing Controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image21| | **Pan:** Click and Drag to move the graph window                      |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image22| | **Zoom:** Drag a box to select the region to zoom in to               |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |image23| | **Reset:** Reverts the pan and zoom settings to their original values |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The range of the axes can also be changed by clicking on the first or last value
in the range.
