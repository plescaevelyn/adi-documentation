HowTo: observe the FM band with an AD9361-equipped board
========================================================

About FM radio
--------------

**FM band:**

-  In Europe and Africa: 87.5 MHz to 107.9 MHz
-  In America: 87.9 MHz to 107.9 MHz
-  In Japan: 76.0 MHz to 90 MHz

**FM channels:**

-  either 200 kHz wide, with a frequency deviation limited to 150 kHz total,
-  or 100 kHz wide, with a frequency deviation limited to 75 KHz total.

The sysfs interface
-------------------

It is possible to configure the AD9361 chip directly from sysfs. The interesting files are located in **/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX** where X is the number of the device whose name is **ad9361-phy**:

::

   root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1/name
   ad9361-phy

This directory contains several files, some of which can be used to read raw
values from the hardware, while others are used to configure the ad9361 chip.

The program we will use, :doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`, use the sysfs interface to configure the ad9361, and use the special character device /dev/iio:device1 to read the raw values.

Equipment used
--------------

This test has been realized with a `Zed board <http://zedboard.org/content/overview>`_, coupled with a :adi:`ad-fmcomms3-ebz` module.

Monitoring the FM band
----------------------

We will monitor the most used FM band, from 87.5 MHz to 107.9 MHz. The :doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>` can be configured like this:

   :width: 300

-  **RX LO Frequency**: the base frequency at which the hardware will be tuned. Set to 87.4 MHz (and not 87.5, since 87.5 is the middle of a 200 KHz channel);
-  **RF Baudwidth**: the size of the band you want to capture. Here, we want at least a band of 107.9 - 87.5 = 20.4 MHz
-  **Sampling rate**: the number of samples you want to capture (in millions per second). Here we set this to 22, so that we get a resolution of approximatively one hertz.

Lanch a capture, and you will be able to see peaks in the frequency domain:

In this screenshot, it is clearly possible to identify several channels: at 95.5
MHz, 96.3 MHz, 97.5 MHz, 98.4 MHz among other frequencies.

Playback
--------

To verify if those frequencies actually correspond to something, we can use the **iio_fm_radio** tool. But first, it is necessary to change the gain control:

::

   echo fast_attack > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1/in_voltage1_gain_control_mode

Then, the **iio_fm_radio_play** tool will playback the desired channel on the speaker of the HDMI monitor:

::

   iio_fm_radio_play 95.5

To directly get access to the audio waveform data the **iio_fm_radio** tool can be used. This tool outputs the audio data (in 16-bit mono at 48kHz) on standard output from where it can be taken and further processed. E.g. the following command plays back the stream on the headphone jack of the ZED board.

::

   iio_fm_radio 95.5 | aplay -D default:CARD=ADAU1761 -r 48000 -f S16
