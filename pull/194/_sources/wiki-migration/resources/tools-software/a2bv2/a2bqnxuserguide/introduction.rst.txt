Introduction
============

The demo A2B Application on QNX is built by re-implementing A2B Stack’s Platform
Abstraction Layer (PAL) for QNX operating system. The architecture of A2B Stack
Software PAL and demo application on QNX is as shown in below Figure. The PAL
layer on QNX resides in user space. It utilizes the standard device drivers to
interact with the hardware. Hence the PAL layer on QNX and demo application can
be configured to be run on any platform supporting a port of QNX.
