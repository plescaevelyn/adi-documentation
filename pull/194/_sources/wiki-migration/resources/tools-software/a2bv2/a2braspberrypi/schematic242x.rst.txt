SigmaStudioPlus Example Schematic for 242x
==========================================

A2B transceivers can be configured using the SigmaStudio+ tool, which offers a
graphical interface for programming, development, and tuning of ADI DSP audio
processors. With SigmaStudio+, the configuration of the A2B Master node and
Subnode can be performed, as illustrated in the attached image.

Stream Configuration
--------------------

A2B transceivers can be configured with multiple streams, as shown below. The
figure illustrates the stream configuration for the 242x Transceiver.

Further tuning can be performed for the Main Transceiver node property settings,
as shown below.

Bus Configuration Export
------------------------

To work with the transceiver nodes, a Bus Configuration File (BCF, .bcf) is
required, which can be generated as shown below. This .bcf file is necessary
when building the A2B Stack application for the Raspberry Pi board.

Running Example with 242x Transceiver
-------------------------------------

After migrating to the latest A2B stack, export the adi_a2b_busconfig.c file from the respective SigmaStudio+ version (compiled with the A2B stack) and paste it into the appropriate location in the Raspberry Pi application. Then, clean and build the application, and run it as explained in :doc:`Build kernel and Run application </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/a2bv2/a2braspberrypi/buildingkernel>`.
