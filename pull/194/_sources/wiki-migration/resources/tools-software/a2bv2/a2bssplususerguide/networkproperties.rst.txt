Network Properties
==================

The Network Properties tab, as shown in figure below, offers configurable
options for the target processor software. With these settings one can select
the node discovery and initialization method to be used and the clock source for
the A2B network.

The four possible discovery methods are

**Simple:** All sub nodes are discovered sequentially from sub 0 to the last available sub node in the system. Once all the sub nodes are discovered, they are initialized for synchronous data exchange.

**Modified:** All sub nodes are discovered and immediately initialized (for synchronous data exchange) sequentially from sub 0 to the last available sub node in the system.(Not supported for AD2437)

**Optimized:** Even before a node is initialized the host tries to discover the next node. The time for the next node to be discovered is used to initialize the current node. Synchronous data can start only after all nodes are discovered and initialized. (Not supported for AD2437)

**Advanced:** Even before a node is initialized the host tries to discover the next node. The time for the next node to be discovered is used to initialize the current node. Synchronous data exchange can start as soon as a main and sub node 0 is initialized (Not supported for AD243x main).

**Discovery Start Delay (ms):** Delay (in milliseconds) to wait after a software reset and before discovery start.

**Rediscovery wait time (ms):** Delay(in milliseconds) to wait between discovery for systems containing Medium and High-Power Slaves.

The Line Fault settings allow user to enable fault diagnostic feature of the
software. With this any line fault encountered in the system is handled and
reported to the user.

**Override Bus Self Discovery:** If checked, Bus self-discovery status is ignored, discovery process starts with the soft-reset of A2B network. If unchecked, software looks for a self-discovered network, configures the network as per the schematic.

**Enable Line Fault Diagnostics:** Enables line fault diagnostic feature of software. When set, SigmaStudio+ will continuously monitor the network for faults at 1 second interval. Detected faults will be handled and notified.

**Rediscovery upon faults:** If checked, automatic network rediscovery or partial discovery will be performed upon detecting post-discovery faults. **Partial discovery:**\ If checked, automatic partial re-discovery of dropped nodes are attempted instead of a bus discovery of all nodes.

-  **No. of Attempts:** Specifies the number of partial re-discovery attempts to be tried if the fault persists(-1 for infinite retry).
-  **Discovery Interval(ms):** Delay between each re-discovery attempt in milliseconds.

**Stack Debug Settings:** This feature allows the user to analyze/ understand the system by using the information logged during stack execution. Information can be either through TRACE or sequence chart or both.

-  **Tracing:** Logs key information and network events during the stack execution to a text file. User can configure the required ‘Level’ and ‘Domain’ for tracing.
-  **Sequence Chart:** Sequence Chart captures network transactions in the form of a rich graphical sequence diagram. The sequence chart enables easy understanding of the discovery flow, fault analysis and various other interactions within the system thus enabling quick debugging.

The Refresh |image2| button checks and updates the discovery status of connected A2B Nodes upon a click.

.. note::

   The Network Properties can also be updated using Thrift. For more information you can refer to :doc:`Thrift Document </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/a2bv2/quickstartguide/thriftuserguide/networkproperties>`.

Debug
=====

Trace
-----

The Trace option in the Network properties window show in :doc:`Figure </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/a2bv2/a2bssplususerguide/networkproperties>` enables user to log various transactions and network events into a .txt file. Upon enabling this feature the A2B stack running inside SigmaStudio+ captures all transactions as per the ‘Level’ and ‘Domain’ set. :doc:`Figure </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/a2bv2/a2bssplususerguide/networkproperties>` shows a sample Trace file generated for selected Level (Debug, Info, Trace3) and Domain (Plugin, Message, I2C). The Trace file gets saved inside the ‘Settings’ folder corresponding to the A2B schematic project file location.

Sequence Chart
--------------

The Sequence Chart option in the Network properties window show in :doc:`Figure </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/a2bv2/a2bssplususerguide/networkproperties>` enables user to view various transactions and network events as a rich graphical sequence diagram (.png).

The sequence diagram shows interactions between different stack modules arranged
in time sequence and the messages exchanged between the stack modules to
discover, configure and handle various network events.

The Sequence Chart file gets saved inside the ‘Settings’ folder corresponding to
the A2B schematic project file location.

Following prerequisites shall be ensured to generate the sequence chart upon
discovery completion.

**Prerequisites:**

-  Ensure ‘postProcessUML.exe’ and ‘plantuml.jar’ from A2B release package (<<A2B plugin for SigmaStudio+ installation path>>\\\\\\Target\\\\tools) are copied to C:\\ProgramData\\Analog Devices\\A2B-AddOns
-  Set the PATH environment variable for running ‘java.exe’ (Most of the times
   they are set by default)

   -  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre<<xx>>\\bin

If the prerequisites are met and sequence chart option is enabled in the Network
properties tab, then upon successful discovery of A2B network, the Sequence
chart will be generated which can be viewed by clicking on the View button. A
Sequence chart generated for a 3 node sample demo schematic is shown in Figure

Network Analysis and Debug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SigmaStudio+ allows user to estimate important network parameters like Bandwidth
and power consumption. It also allows user to monitor real-time bit errors in
the system using pseudo or actual bit stream. This option can be accessed using
the Right-Click menu of the Main Transceiver node as shown in below figure. Note
that calculate… option is accessible only if the A2B schematic is ‘Link’ed after
the last schematic modification. Save schematic and click on the ‘Link’ icon if
the option is disabled.
