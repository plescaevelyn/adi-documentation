U-Boot Falcon Mode
==================

This page provides instructions for using U-Boot Falcon Mode on ADSP-SC59X
boards.

.. note::

   The Falcon Mode feature is supported on versions :doc:`Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors 3.0.0 </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/releaselandingpages/3.0.0>` and later and on SC59x.

What is Falcon Mode?
--------------------

It is described in the upstream repo of U-Boot: `U-Boot Falcon Mode <https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/doc/README.falcon>`_. In short, it's a way to shorten the boot time by allowing the SPL (Secondary Program Loader) to boot the kernel directly, without loading the full bootloader.

Requirements
------------

You must use :doc:`Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors 3.0.0 </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/releaselandingpages/3.0.0>` or later on an SC59x board.

Build U-Boot with Falcon Mode support
-------------------------------------

When following the Quickstart guides and specifically right after sourcing the
setup script, i.e.

.. code:: bash

   $ source setup-environment -m adsp-sc598-som-ezkit

a build folder along with a local build configuration file is created, under ``$PROJECT_DIR/build/conf/local.conf``. Edit this file with your favourite text editor, and append the following two lines to it:

.. code:: bash

   MACHINE_FEATURES:remove = " spl"
   MACHINE_FEATURES:append = " falcon"

and proceed to building and flashing the image, as usual and as seen on the
Quickstart guides.

Booting with Falcon Mode
------------------------

When U-Boot with Falcon Mode support has been built and flashed onto the board,
the default behaviour will be booting the default mode (SPI boot, if unchanged)
straight from the SPL, e.g.:

.. code:: bash

You can still fall back to U-Boot Proper by holding down the push button ``PB1`` on the target (carrier) board during reset/booting:

You will then be able to use the full U-Boot:

.. code:: bash

   U-Boot SPL 2020.10 (Apr 12 2023 - 18:48:14 +0000)
