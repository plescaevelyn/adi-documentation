   The following instructions are correct for developers using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Installing Required Packages
============================

In order to build and deploy Linux to your ADSP-SC5xx development board you will
need to install several additional packages on to your host PC. This can be
performed using the following command and respond yes(y) to any prompts:

::

   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm u-boot-tools openssl curl tftpd-hpa python

If you are running on a 64-bit host, then you also need to install the following
packages:

::

   $ sudo apt-get install zlib1g:i386 libncurses5:i386

Installing CrossCore Embedded Studio
====================================

Browse to :adi:`en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/linuxaddin.html#software-overview` and download the 2.8.3 release of CrossCore Embedded Studio. Install the .deb package.

::

   $ sudo dpkg -i adi-CrossCoreEmbeddedStudio-linux-x86-2.8.3.deb

Add the **/opt/analog/cces/2.8.3/ARM/arm-none-eabi/bin** directory to your path.

Setting Up TFTP
===============

We use the TFTP server on the host to transfer images to the EZ-KIT. This needs
to be configured for use:

::

   $ sudo vi /etc/default/tftpd-hpa

   #add following commands
   TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
   TFTP_DIRECTORY="/tftpboot"
   TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
   TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"

   $ sudo mkdir /tftpboot
   $ sudo chmod 777 /tftpboot
   $ sudo service tftpd-hpa restart

Setting Up NFS Server
=====================

We can use the NFS server on the host to transfer images to the EZ-KIT. If you
wish to use the NFS boot method you can install the NFS server on your host PC.
This needs to be configured for use:

::

   $ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
   $ sudo vi /etc/exports

   #Add following commands
   /romfs *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

   $ sudo mkdir /romfs/
   $ sudo chmod 777 /romfs/
   $ sudo service nfs-kernel-server start

Configuring Minicom
===================

In order to communicate with the U-Boot bootloader, a UART connection must be made between the host PC and the development board. It is recommended that you use **minicom** to do this. Minicom must be configured to connect to U-Boot correctly.

On the host PC open a terminal and execute the following commands:

::

   $ sudo apt-get install minicom
   $ sudo minicom -s
