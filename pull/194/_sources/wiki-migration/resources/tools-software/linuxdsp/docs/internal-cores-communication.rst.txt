Internal Cores Communication
============================

The Yocto Linux Product provides user space APIs that allow applications to
easily communicate between individual cores of the ADSP-SC5xx processor.

Communication is performed using the Remote Processor Messaging Protocol (RPMsg)
which defines an API and a semantics for communication and synchronization
between processing cores in embedded systems. RPMsg is supported on ARM as part
of Linux and as RPMsg-Lite on SHARC and ARM cores of the ADSP-SC5xx processors
in both bare-metal and RTOS using CrossCore Embedded Studio.

ADSP-SC5xx is a series of products with multiple processor cores (two SHARC+
cores and an ARM® Cortex-A5 processor), this page provides some approaches to
support the multi-core communication/control termed as the Internal Cores
Communications (ICC) which contains the sections:
