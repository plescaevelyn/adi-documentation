Yocto Linux 3.0.0 Quickstart Guide for ADSP-SC598
=================================================

.. important::

   The following instructions are for the ADSP-SC598-EZKIT development board (the EV-SC598-SOM System-on-Module (SOM) board attached to the EV-SOMCRR-EZKIT carrier board). For instructions for other processors and development boards please refer to :doc:`Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors 3.0.0 </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/releaselandingpages/3.0.0>`\


Setting Up Your Host PC
-----------------------

The build system is currently supported on host PCs running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 64-bit.

Installing Required Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to build and deploy Linux to your ADSP-SC598-EZKIT development board you will need to install the following packages on your host PC.

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install -y gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm u-boot-tools openssl curl tftpd-hpa python zstd liblz4-tool

Configuring TFTP Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TFTP server on the host is used to transfer images to the development board. Install and configure.

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo vi /etc/default/tftpd-hpa

   #Replace the existing file with the following
   TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
   TFTP_DIRECTORY="/tftpboot"
   TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
   TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"
   #End of File

   $ sudo mkdir /tftpboot
   $ sudo chmod 777 /tftpboot
   $ sudo service tftpd-hpa restart

Configure Minicom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to communicate with the U-Boot bootloader, a UART connection must be made between the host PC and the development board. It is recommended that you use minicom to do this. Minicom must be configured to connect to U-Boot correctly.

On the host PC open a terminal and execute the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install -y minicom
   $ sudo minicom -s

               +-----[configuration]------+


               | Filenames and paths      |

               | File transfer protocols  |
               | Serial port setup        |
               | Modem and dialing        |
               | Screen and keyboard      |
               | Save setup as dfl        |
               | Save setup as..          |
               | Exit                     |
               | Exit from Minicom        |
               +--------------------------+


   # Select Serial port setup
        Set Serial Device to /dev/ttyUSB0
        Set Bps/Par/Bits to 115200 8N1
        Set Hardware Flow Control to No

        Close the Serial port setup option by press Esc
    Select Save setup as dfl
    Select Exit

.. note::

   \ ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` might not correspond to the serial port of the board on every system. You can determine which ``/dev`` entry your board uses by running ``ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*`` twice, once when the serial port of the board is plugged in, and once when it isn't.


Installing the Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example is fully contained in the Analog Devices Yocto Linux github repositories.

To install the sources:

.. code:: bash

   $ mkdir ~/gxp2
   $ cd ~/gxp2
   $ mkdir bin
   $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ./bin/repo
   $ chmod a+x ./bin/repo
   $ ./bin/repo init \
      -u :git-lnxdsp-repo-manifest:`lnxdsp-repo-manifest` \
      -b release/yocto-3.0.0 \
      -m release-yocto-3.0.0.xml
   $ ./bin/repo sync

Building the Image
------------------

Preparing the buildtool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yocto requires the environment to be configured before building is possible.  A setup-environment script in the gxp2 folder contains all the required environment settings for your build target. Source the setup script for your board:

.. code:: bash

   $ source setup-environment -m adsp-sc598-som-ezkit

Sourcing the script will configure your build environment and create a build folder along with a local build configuration file.  See the Yocto Manual for further details.

.. important::

   Note that the build environment needs to be sourced once only before building.  If later working in a different terminal the setup-environment script should be sourced again.  If sourcing the setup-environment script is done without specifying the machine Yocto will reuse the previous configuration settings and retain any changes made to the files in the conf folder.


Building the example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can build two different versions of the root file system; minimal and full. To build the example images invoke bitbake from within the build directory created previously.

.. code:: bash

   $ bitbake adsp-sc5xx-minimal
   $ bitbake adsp-sc5xx-full

When the build completes you will see a warning that the ELF binary has relocations in .text. It is OK to ignore this warning

.. note::

   Building a Linux distribution with Yocto is a significantly demanding process, both in CPU and network usage. A full build from scratch is estimated to take around 170 minutes for an 11th Gen Intel Core i5-11500T with 16 GB of RAM and a stable, fast Internet connection. This estimate can go up significantly for a poorer Internet connection or CPU resources, so set aside plenty of time for a clean build.


Building the SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK will provide you with the cross toolchain needed to develop application for the target board, alongside various miscellaneous tools. Notably, it will provide you with OpenOCD and GDB, which you can use to run and flash U-Boot on the board.

The SDK can be built for the ``adsp-sc5xx-minimal`` image or the ``adsp-sc5xx-full image``. To build the SDK for the adsp-sc5xx-minimal image invoke bitbake from within the build directory created previously.

.. code:: bash

   $ bitbake adsp-sc5xx-minimal -c populate_sdk

or for the adsp-sc5xx-full image

.. code:: bash

   $ bitbake adsp-sc5xx-full -c populate_sdk

When the build has completed you will find a set of files in the <BUILD_DIR>/tmp/deploy/sdk directory. For example, the minimal image on SC598:

.. code:: bash

   $ ls tmp/deploy/sdk
   adi-distro-glibc-glibc-x86_64-adsp-sc5xx-minimal-cortexa55-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit-toolchain-3.0.0.host.manifest
   adi-distro-glibc-glibc-x86_64-adsp-sc5xx-minimal-cortexa55-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit-toolchain-3.0.0.sh
   adi-distro-glibc-glibc-x86_64-adsp-sc5xx-minimal-cortexa55-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit-toolchain-3.0.0.target.manifest
   adi-distro-glibc-glibc-x86_64-adsp-sc5xx-minimal-cortexa55-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit-toolchain-3.0.0.testdata.json

The ``adi-distro-glibc-glibc-x86_64-adsp-sc5xx-minimal-cortexa55-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit-toolchain-3.0.0.sh`` is a self-extracting archive containing the SDK.

Installing the SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Invoke the self-extracting archive. It will default to installing to ``/opt/adi-distro-glibc/3.0.0`` but gives you the option to select your own install folder during the installation. For the minimal image on SC598

.. code:: bash

   $ ./adi-distro-glibc-glibc-x86_64-adsp-sc5xx-minimal-cortexa55-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit-toolchain-3.0.0.sh
   **Analog Devices Inc Reference Distro (glibc) SDK installer version 3.0.0**

   Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/adi-distro-glibc/3.0.0):
   You are about to install the SDK to "/opt/adi-distro-glibc/3.0.0". Proceed [Y/n]?
   Extracting SDK....................................................................................................................done
   Setting it up...done
   SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.
   Each time you wish to use the SDK in a new shell session, you need to source the environment setup script e.g.
    $ . /opt/adi-distro-glibc/3.0.0/environment-setup-cortexa55-adi_glibc-linux

Your SDK is now installed.

Running U-Boot on the Board for the first time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   It's always good practice to erase the contents of ``/tftpboot/`` before running and/or flashing a new build of U-Boot or Linux. You can do so by executing ``rm /tftpboot/*`` before proceeding


Copy the U-Boot binary & loader files to the tftp directory:

.. code:: bash

   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/u-boot-proper-sc598-som-ezkit.elf /tftpboot/
   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/u-boot-spl-sc598-som-ezkit.elf /tftpboot/
   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/stage1-boot.ldr /tftpboot/
   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/stage2-boot.ldr /tftpboot/

Before installing the software on to the development board, ensure that the following cables are connected:

-  Board connected to network via ethernet cable using J13 connector.
-  Board connected to host PC using USB micro cable, connected to USB/UART port on the development board
-  Board connected to the ICE 1000 or ICE 2000 via the DEBUG port on the board
-  ICE is also connected to host PC via USB mini cable

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/docs/quickstartguide/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit_overview-4.png
   :width: 400px

-  On the carrier board is a set of micro switches labelled SW1. These should all be set to the OFF position before continuing.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/docs/quickstartguide/adsp-sc594-som-ezkit-switches.jpg
   :width: 400px

-  The Power jumper JP1 on the EV-SC598-SOM board should be fitted so that it shorts the two pins closest to the edge. This will enable the routing of power from the SOMCRR-EZKIT.

-  The BOOT MODE selector on the EV-SC598-SOM board should be turned to "0".

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/docs/quickstartguide/sc598-closeup-1.jpg
   :width: 400px

The console output from U-Boot and later on Linux will appear on the USB serial port configured in minicom earlier so open up minicom.

::

   ;''**Terminal1: minicom**''
   :<code bash>$ sudo minicom </code>

In a separate console launch OpenOCD and connect to the development board.

::

   ;''**Terminal2: OpenOCD**''
   :<code bash>

$ sdk_usr=/opt/adi-distro-glibc/3.0.0/sysroots/x86_64-adi_glibc_sdk-linux/usr/ $ $sdk_usr/bin/openocd -f $sdk_usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/<ICE>.cfg -f $sdk_usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/adspsc59x_a55.cfg </code> Where ``<ICE>`` should be replaced with ``ice1000`` or ``ice2000`` depending on your hardware. When successful you should see a message similar to the console output below

.. code:: bash

Flash U-Boot to SPI Flash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the U-Boot console, set the IP address of the Linux PC that hosts the U-Boot loader files (``stage1-boot.ldr`` & ``stage2-boot.ldr``) on TFTP.

::

   ;''**Terminal1: minicom**''
   :

.. code:: bash

   => setenv serverip <SERVERIP>
   => setenv tftpserverip <SERVERIP>

.. note::

   To find the IP address of your host Linux PC you can issue the ``ip addr`` command from the shell or console.


If your network **supports** DHCP, run:

.. code:: bash

   => dhcp

If your network **does NOT support** DHCP, run:

.. code:: bash

   => set ipaddr <ADDR>

Where ``<ADDR>`` is the IP address you want to assign.

.. note::

   If flashing a board that had been previously programmed, it's good to erase the whole flash before as sometimes previous U-Boot installations might leave remnants. You can do that by typing ``=> sf probe ${sfdev}; sf erase 0 0x4000000`` on the U-Boot prompt before proceeding to the following instructions


Next, run the U-Boot update command to copy the U-Boot loader files from the host PC to the target board, and write it into flash:

.. code:: bash

   => run update_spi_uboot_only

You will see an output similar to the one below:

.. code:: bash

   => run update_spi_uboot_only
   Speed: 1000, full duplex

   device 0 offset 0x20000, size 0x99b70
   SF: 629616 bytes @ 0x20000 Written: OK

In order to store the ``serverip`` and the DHCP or otherwise assigned IP address of the board and have them available on next boot, you can run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   => saveenv
   Saving Environment to SPIFlash... Erasing SPI flash...Writing to SPI flash...done
   OK

At this point the U-Boot binary is stored in flash. You can now disconnect the ICE-1000 or ICE-2000 from the development board and make sure to switch the BMODE to position 1. You will only need to reconnect this if your board fails to boot and you need to re-follow these instructions.

Booting Linux
-------------

Booting the minimal image from QSPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The U-Boot console is used to copy U-Boot (SPL and Proper), the minimal root filesystem image and the fitImage (which contains the kernel image and dtb file) into RAM and then write them to Flash. Copy the required files from <BUILD DIR>/tmp/deploy/images to your /tftpboot directory.

.. code:: bash

   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/stage1-boot.ldr /tftpboot/
   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/stage2-boot.ldr /tftpboot/
   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/fitImage /tftpboot/
   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/adsp-sc5xx-minimal-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit.jffs2 /tftpboot

If your network **supports** DHCP, run:

.. code:: bash

   => run update_spi

If your network **does NOT support** DHCP, in the U-Boot console configure the board IP address and remove the "run init_ethernet;" from the "start_update_spi" command.

.. code:: bash

   => setenv ipaddr <IPADDR>
   => edit start_update_spi
   => edit: <remove "run init_ethernet;" from here> sf probe ${sfdev}; sf erase 0 ${sfsize}; run update_spi_uboot; run update_spi_fit; run update_spi_rfs; sleep 3; saveenv
   => run update_spi

After removing "run init_ethernet;" from update_spi, issue the "run update_spi" command as above.

You should see output similar to the following.

.. code:: bash

   => run update_spi

Rebuild U-boot in Yocto

.. code:: bash

   $ devtool build u-boot-adi

Formatting the SD Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use an SD Card with Linux we need to prepare it by formatting it in the correct format. This section of instructions requires you to correctly identify the SD Card and format the card. If you select the wrong drive you may cause irreversible damage to you Host PC. To format the SD Card, follow the commands below. The example code in this section assumes that the SD Card device is reported to be /dev/sdb. Ensure that you change these commands to use your device.

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   /* Create primary partition 1, 256M size*/
   Command (m for help): n
   Select (default p): p
   Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
   First sector (2048-3887103, default 2048): PRESS ENTER
   Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-3887103, default 3887103): PRESS ENTER

   /* Save partition */
   Command (m for help): w

Format the SD card to EXT filesystem

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

Writing the kernel and file system to the SD Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, we need to copy the Linux file system and kernel image to the SD Card. We install this on to the SD Card by mounting the file system on to the local Host PC and copying the contents on to the SD Card. To allow the choice of booting using ramboot and sdcard boot we copy the ramboot image to the SD card as well as extract the minimal image to the SD card.

.. code:: bash

   $ mkdir ~/mnt
   $ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 ~/mnt
   $ sudo mkdir ~/mnt/boot
   $ sudo cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/adsp-sc5xx-ramdisk-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit.cpio.xz ~/mnt/boot/adsp-sc5xx-ramdisk-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit.cpio.xz.u-boot
   $ sudo cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/sc598-som-ezkit.dtb ~/mnt/boot/
   $ sudo cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/fitImage ~/mnt/boot/
   $ sudo tar -xf tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/adsp-sc5xx-minimal-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit.tar.xz -C ~/mnt
   $ sudo umount ~/mnt

The file system and kernel image are now installed on to the SD Card. The SD Card can now be safely removed from the Host PC.

Booting Linux from the SD card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set U-boot environment variables

.. code:: bash

   => setenv mmcargs 'setenv bootargs root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 rw rootfstype=ext4 rootwait earlycon=adi_uart,0x31003000 console=ttySC0,115200'
   => setenv mmcboot 'mmc rescan; run mmcload; run mmcargs; bootm ${loadaddr};'
   => setenv mmcload 'ext4load mmc 0:1 ${loadaddr} /boot/${imagefile};'
   => saveenv

Run Linux from SD card

.. code:: bash

   $ run mmcboot

The linux kernel will then boot up using the file system stored in SD card.

Booting rootfs from SD card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the steps to enable SD card boot. This step include enabling emmc peripheral in Linux Kernel.

.. code:: bash

   $ devtool modify linux-adi

Rebuild the Linux kernel

.. code:: bash

   $ devtool build linux-adi

Copy the new generated fitImage to boot folder on SD card.

Booting Linux from USB Mass Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Formatting USB stick
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First step is to format USB stick to U-Boot supported formats.

To format the USB stick, follow the commands below. The example code in this section assumes that the USB device is reported to be /dev/sdb. Ensure that you change these commands to use your device.

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   /* Create primary partition 1, 256M size*/
   Command (m for help): n
   Select (default p): p
   Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1

   Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-3887103, default 3887103): PRESS ENTER

   /* Save partition */
   Command (m for help): w

Format the USB stick to EXT4 filesystem

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

Writing kernel and rootfs image to USB Mass Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

   $ mkdir ~/mnt
   $ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 ~/mnt
   $ sudo mkdir ~/mnt/boot
   $ sudo tar -xf tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/adsp-sc5xx-minimal-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit.tar.xz -C ~/mnt
   $ sudo cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/fitImage ~/mnt/boot/
   $ sudo umount ~/mnt

Booting Linux from the USB Mass Storage device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To boot from ADSP-SC598-EZKIT run in u-boot

.. code:: bash

   => setenv usbload 'ext4load usb 0 ${initramaddr} /boot/${initramfile}; ext4load usb 0 ${loadaddr} /boot/${imagefile};'
   => setenv usbboot 'usb start; run usbload; run ramargs; bootm ${loadaddr} ${initramaddr};'
   => run usbboot

Booting rootfs from USB Mass Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the step how to setup USB stick in chapter above :doc:`Yocto Linux 3.0.0 Quickstart Guide for ADSP-SC598 </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/docs/quickstartguide/quickstart_sc598_3_0_0>`. Set environment variables in U-boot

.. code:: bash

   => setenv usbargs 'setenv bootargs root=/dev/sda1 rw rootfstype=ext4 rootwait earlycon=adi_uart,0x31003000 console=ttySC0,115200'
   => setenv usbload 'ext4load usb 0 ${loadaddr} /boot/${imagefile};'
   => setenv usbboot 'usb start; run usbload; run usbargs; bootm ${loadaddr};'

And type to boot

.. code:: bash

   => run usbboot

Now the rootfs is set to your USB stick and amount of space equals of size of partition on USB stick.

Booting Linux Using TFTP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to boot Linux, the TFTP server should be setup as :doc:`above </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linuxdsp/docs/quickstartguide/quickstart_sc598>` and a copy of the fitImage should be copied into the **/tftpboot** directory.

.. code:: bash

   $ cp tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/fitImage /tftpboot/

NFS Boot
^^^^^^^^

For NFS boot we use the Network File System which is stored in local Ubuntu Host. This is suggested when you do application development. To setup the NFS server:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
   $ sudo vi /etc/exports

   #Add following commands
   /romfs *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

   $ sudo mkdir /romfs/
   $ sudo chmod 777 /romfs/
   $ sudo service nfs-kernel-server start

We can verify that the NFS service is running by executing

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo service nfs-kernel-server status

The output will indicate that the server is active, i.e.

.. code:: bash

   ● nfs-server.service - NFS server and services
        Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nfs-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
       Drop-In: /run/systemd/generator/nfs-server.service.d
                └─order-with-mounts.conf
        Active: active (exited) since Tue 2022-09-06 14:38:31 BST; 3 months 14 days ago
      Main PID: 953 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
         Tasks: 0 (limit: 18797)
        Memory: 0B
        CGroup: /system.slice/nfs-server.service

   Sep 06 14:38:29 $YOUR_HOSTNAME systemd[1]: Starting NFS server and services...
   Sep 06 14:38:31 $YOUR_HOSTNAME systemd[1]: Finished NFS server and services.

If it's reported as inactive, wait a few moments and check the status again.

The root filesystem should then be copied to /romfs.

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo tar -xf tmp/deploy/images/adsp-sc598-som-ezkit/adsp-sc5xx-full-adsp-sc598-som-ezkit.tar.xz -C /romfs

Booting into Linux from TFTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, on the target, from u-boot, run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   => run nfsboot
   ......
   ......
