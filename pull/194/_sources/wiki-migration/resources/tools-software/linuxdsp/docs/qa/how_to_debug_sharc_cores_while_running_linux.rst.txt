How to Debug SHARC Applications While Running Linux on the ARM Core of the ADSP-SC5xx Processor
===============================================================================================

When attempting to debug SHARC applications using CrossCore Embedded Studio, it
is important to ensure that the debug session does not interfere with execution
of Linux running on the ARM core of the processor.

Since the ARM is the booting core for the SC5xx processors, Linux will be
running when you connect to the Cross Core Embedded Studio debugger.

You will need to make several changes when creating a debug session for the
SHARC cores to avoid interfering with Linux.

Ensure that the debug session does not load any preloads or applications to the ARM core
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default the debug session will attempt to load applications on to the ARM
core.

When creating the debug session you will need to remove any preload or initcode
binary and ensure that an application is not loaded. This will ensure that the
L2 and L3 memory reserved for the ARM core is not changed by the debug session
(Assuming that you have either used the default memory configuration or
correctly repartitioned the memory between the cores)

Ensure that the debug session does not reset the processor when loading the SHARC cores
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default the debug session will reset the processor when starting a debug
session. Since this cannot be performed on a core by core basis the whole system
is reset, wiping the running Linux from memory.

When creating the debug session you will need to uncheck the option to "reset on
reload" from the debug session settings.

Ensure that semihosting does not interfere with Linux running on the ARM core
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When creating a debug session for SC5xx processors by default CrossCore Embedded
Studio uses the ARM supervisor call (SVC) instruction to trigger a communication
to the host PC. Unfortunately this instruction is used by Linux for other
purposes. By leaving this feature active the execution of Linux will become
considerably slower and may result in crashes.

When creating the debug session you will need to uncheck the "Use semihosting"
checkbox from the debug session settings.

This will ensure that the emulator does not halt the board for each execution of
the SVC instruction.
