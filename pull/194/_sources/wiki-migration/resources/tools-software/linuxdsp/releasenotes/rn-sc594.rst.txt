Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors - Release for ADSP-SC594: Release Notes
=============================================================================

Introduction
------------

This release of Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors is a release specific to the ADSP-SC594 SOM board and ADSP-EZKIT Carrier board. This release **does not** support other ADSP-SC5xx processors that are supported by the 1.0 Release of Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors.

Future of this Release
----------------------

Once the other existing processors have been upgraded to the same versions of U-Boot, Linux and Yocto, this release will be merged and all processors will be supported under a single 2.0 release. At that point, support for this release will cease. All future maintenance for the ADSP-SC594 will then be incorporated into the main Yocto Linux Release.

Supported Linux Distributions
-----------------------------

The Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx processors product is formally supported on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 64-bit**. While the product will likely build on other modern Linux distributions, ADI support for build issues will only be provided when using the supported Linux distribution.

Supported Processors and EZ-KITs
--------------------------------

The following processors and silicon revisions are supported by the Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx product.

- ADSP-SC594 SOM-EZ in combination with the ADSP-EZKIT-CRR Carrier Board

System Requirements
-------------------

The following system requirements are recommended:

-  Modern multi-core CPU
-  8GB RAM
-  At least 60GB of disk space

For installation on the development board your host PC will require:

-  Two open USB ports

Note: The Yocto Linux product is built from source. For improved performance we recommend at least 4 cores and a SSD disk.
