Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors - Beta Release for ADSP-SC589: Release Notes
==================================================================================

Introduction
------------

This release of Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors is a release specific to the ADSP-SC589 EZ-Kit Development Board. This release **does not** support other ADSP-SC5xx processors that are supported by the 1.0 Release of Yocto Linux for ADSP-SC5xx Processors.

The release contains an upgrade of all the key components to a recent LTS release. Support for other processors will follow shortly.

Future of this Release
----------------------

Once the other existing processors have been upgraded to the same versions of U-Boot, Linux and Yocto, this release will be merged and all processors will be supported under a single 2.0 release. At that point, support for this release will cease. All future maintenance for the ADSP-SC589 will then be incorporated into the main Yocto Linux Release.
