=====================

Windows
-------

For example:

::

   Enter the system_top.hdf location
   "example => C:/workspace/my_proj1_hdf/system_top.hdf"
   system_top.hdf
   Enter the project build folder
   "example => C:/my_workspaces Note: use "/" instead of "\""
   fmcomms2_zc706

The parameters that were specified in the previous example, can be passed directly if the script is run from a command line.

For example:

::

   create_xilinx_sdk_project.bat D:/workspace/example_hdf/system_top.hdf D:/workspace/example_project/fmcadc2_zc706

.. tip::

   A default path of the Xilinx SDK installation folder is specified in the script. If you have installed the package in a different location, please modify the script accordingly


Makefile
~~~~~~~~

Using "Xilinx Software Command Line Tool", the projects can be created using the Makefiles.

If no parameters are specified, the default location of the .hdf file and of the folder where the project will be created is the current directory.

For example:

::

Open the created workspace with Xilinx SDK GUI on Windows and Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The workspaces created using the methods described previously, can be also opened using the Xilinx SDK GUI.

Open "Xilinx SDK" and browse for the location of the workspace.

.. tip::

   All the scripts described previously are dependent of the README.md file, from which the list and the path of the drivers used by each project is obtained. By moving the files to other locations will cause scripts malfunctions.
