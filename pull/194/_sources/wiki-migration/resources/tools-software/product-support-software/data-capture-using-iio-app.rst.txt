Precision ADC Data Capture Using IIO Firmware Applications
==========================================================

This page gives an overview of using the IIO based firmware applications for
Precision ADC data capturing. The firmware applications are developed on the ARM
32-bit microcontrollers and 'ARM Mbed' is the primary development platform used.
The visualization of ADC data is done using various IIO clients such as IIO
oscilloscope, ACE, Pyadi-iio drivers, Matlab Precision toolbox, which are
developed and supported by Analog Devices.

Data Capture With IIO Firmware Application
------------------------------------------

This page focuses on the firmware part of 'Data Capturing. The ":doc:`AD7606 IIO Application </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/product-support-software/ad7606_mbed_iio_application>`" is used as a reference for this discussion.

IIO Oscilloscope can be used to capture and visualize the continuous analog or
discrete signals from any ADC device using a IIO firmware application developed
for that particular device. This allows user to monitor a real-time data. Using
this firmware, a user can perform device calibration, change the gain, voltage
range, data rate, etc. (based on device used) and observe the effects that
different configurations have on the data displayed on IIO Oscilloscope. IIO
Oscilloscope also allows users to save the data, which can further be used to
process and analyze it.

The diagram below shows the continuous capture of signals on an AD7606 ADC,
which is an 8-channel DAS. A 1Khz signal is applied on inputs of all 8 analog
channels. The max data capturing rate in firmware is ~30 to 40 KSPS. The data is
transmitted from firmware application at 230400 baud rate using UART serial
link.

The channels for which data is to be captured can be selected from the GUI
window, along with the number of samples to display on screen in a single data
read query. As shown below, all 8 channels are selected for data capture and the
number of requested samples is set at 400 (default). This means, IIO
oscilloscope requests 400 samples per channel, so in this case total 3200
samples. The channels are stored as shown below:

Limitations of Data Capture Using IIO Application
-------------------------------------------------

IIO oscilloscope is intended as a debugging tool and can only be used for data
visualization/capture. It does not perform any sort of data processing. There
are multiple factors which can potentially impact the data capturing and
visualization.

-  Data Capturing/Sampling Rate
-  Data Transmission Rate (serial link)
-  Buffer size limitations in firmware

-

Data Capturing/Sampling Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data capturing or sampling rate defines the maximum rate/speed at which data
can be sampled and captured from the ADC using the IIO firmware application. For
ADC's, typical time to capture single ADC sample is defined as:

**Time to capture single sample: ADC acquisition time + ADC sampling time + ADC data read time over digital interface**

For AD7606, this time is typically 28usec for all 8-channels (obtained in IIO
firmware). AD7606 captures all 8-channels in single conversion cycle. When
calculating the sample rate per second, it is obtained as ~284 KSPS per 8
channels (28usec / 8 = 3.5usec. Sample rate/second = 1/3.5usec = 284 KSPS). This
gives sample rate per channel as ~35KSPS.

35Khz therefore can be considered as the sampling frequency. As per 'Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem', the sampling frequency should theoretically be greater than twice the analog input frequency for faithful reproduction of the signal after conversion. However, in practice sampling frequency should be high enough to capture multiple slices/samples in given period, so that the input signal is replicated smoothly.

Due to this limitations, IIO oscilloscope can capture frequencies which are very
less than max possible data rate. In case of AD7606, it is possible to capture
the signals with frequencies of 4Khz and less when no oversampling is present.
At OSR > 0, the data rate drops down and so higher frequency signals can't be
reproduced correctly. Below plot is captured with 17Khz analog input on channel
1 and it can be seen that the signal is not a pure sine wave.

Data Transmission Rate (serial link)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the rate or speed at which data cane be transmitted to IIO oscilloscope
over the serial link (e.g. UART). The data transmission rate and serial link
used to capture the data plays an important role while capturing data at higher
OSR's Or in scenarios where transmission rate is higher or lower than data
capturing/sampling rate. The IIO oscilloscope requests the data in aperiodic
manner, meaning that new data capture request is sent immediately when data from
previous request is received.

Capturing Rate < Transmission Rate:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If data capturing rate is lower than transmission rate, the firmware can wait
for certain period of time before sufficient samples are captured in the buffer.
If time to capture these samples is higher than IIO oscilloscope timeout period,
the firmware returns the empty/invalid data. Therefore the user must always
ensure that the data rate is always higher than the transmission rate at any
instance. If this is not the case, transmission rate can be reduced by lowering
the baud rate (for UART medium). Also, the requested number of samples must also
be modified according to a data rate of device to avoid IIO oscilloscope getting
timed-out or to have a huge discontinuity in the data visualization.

Another factor that determines the IIO oscilloscope timeout is
'sampling_frequency' attribute. If this attribute is not defined, the timeout
period for IIO oscilloscope during data capture is set to 2sec default, however,
if this attribute is defined, the time is calculated as: number of requested
samples \* (1 / sampling_frequency). For example, if sampling frequency is set
as 400SPS, the timeout period is:

timeout = 400 (requested samples) \* (1 / 10000 SPS) + 1sec = 1.4 sec

Capturing Rate > Transmission Rate:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If data capturing rate is too high compared to the transmission rate, the data
acquisition into a buffer happens faster. So data buffer might fill faster
compared to emptying operation. This might lead to a discontinuity on data
visualization on IIO oscilloscope side as data visualization is limited by data
transmission rate in this case (with slower serial communication link). If
communication link is faster and matches to capturing/sampling rate, the
visualization of data would be more continuous.

-

Buffer size limitations in firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requested number of samples set in IIO oscilloscope must always be less than
half the buffer size set in the IIO firmware. For the case of AD7606 devices,
the max samples to be requested in a single query should not be greater than
4096 for a buffer size of 8192 samples. This is explained below:

The buffer read and write happens in parallel through 2 different events. The
data from buffer is read when new request from IIO oscilloscope occurs while
write operation continues in the background typically through interrupt event
which monitors the end of conversion (new sample available to read). While
reading the data from buffer, at-least 128 samples offset must be present b/w
read and write index of a buffer (this is shown in below diagram). In other
words, the write index must always be greater than read index. The write index
always increments faster compared to read index for devices with fast data
capturing speed compared to transmit speed. For instance, AD7606 can capture 128
samples in 3.5msec, while time it takes to transmit 128 samples is 18msec @230.4
KBPS rate. So, buffer fills faster than emptying it. For slower capturing
devices, this situation is reversed. In those device it is always ensured in the
firmware that read index does not cross the write index at any instance.

So, considering this limitation, the firmware ensures that the buffer is always
read completely after it is full, and before it starts writing new data from
it's head (start index). If this is not done, there is always a possibility that
old data is overwritten when the buffer starts filling from the start or head.
The write index stops at the end of the buffer when it is full and once the
buffer is read completely it is moved to the start to begin filling data from
the head in a circular fashion.

The IIO data is always sent in chunks of 256 bytes. When converted into samples,
it becomes 128 (256 / 2) for the AD7606B device due to its 16-bit (2-byte)
resolution. If requested samples are 400, the number of loops becomes 400 / 128
= 3.21. So samples are transmitted as: 128, 128, 128, 84. This is done in single
loop, so firmware reads the buffer for 128 samples, transmit them over UART link
and then repeat the cycle until all 400 samples are sent. In the last loop, only
84 samples are read and sent to IIO oscilloscope.

   :align: center
   :width: 600

Now, consider the scenario where more than 4096 samples are requested. So assume
5000 samples are requested by IIO oscilloscope for 2 channels. The buffer will
start filling the data and will reach the end of the buffer, thus write index
pointing to 8192. The read is assumed to slower than write, so read index would
be less than write (say read index is pointing to 2000). At this instance, the
write buffer can't really start capturing new data because it can override old
data as a read is still in progress. Assume the read of 5000 samples is complete
in the first request and read index has reached 5000. In the next request a
further 5000 samples would be requested. But the problem now is that the buffer
size is only 8192 and there are no extra samples ((5000 + 5000) - 8192 = 1808)
available to transmit. If samples are not transmitted back to IIO oscilloscope
or dummy/old data is sent, the misalignment of channel data occurs (when more
than 1 channels are selected). This effects the data visualization on IIO
oscilloscope. To avoid this problem, the number of requested samples should
always be less than 4096 for buffer size of 8192 at any instance (or to be
precise, the total requested samples must always be less than half the size of
buffer). This however does not mean only 4096 sample size of buffer is utilized
as described below:

If requested samples are 1050, the max available size of buffer is: available
size = (8192 / 1050) \* 1050 = 7 \* 1050 = 7350. Thus buffer utilizes 7350
samples size from max 8192.

::

                 /* Size of the acquisition buffer (in terms of samples) */
                 #define DATA_BUFFER_SIZE        (8192)

.. important::

   The behavior of data capturing and displaying varies from device to device.
   Two two major things must be considered while designing IIO firmware for any
   device is: 1) Device capture speed 2) Data Transmission speed

   
   If capturing is slower for any device (low data rate), the ODR (output data
   rate) of device must be adjusted accordingly (if applicable) so that time to
   obtain requested samples is always less than the IIO oscilloscope timeout
   period. If ODR is fixed in the device, the time to capture number of
   requested samples by user should always be less than timeout period of IIO
   oscilloscope, otherwise invalid data is returned back. Therefore the user
   must provide valid count for requested samples.

If requested samples is set higher than the available buffer size, a constant
value is transmitted to IIO oscilloscope to avoid IIO oscilloscope becoming
unresponsive. As shown below, requested samples are 1000 \* 8 = 8000, which is
greater than 4096 (available buffer size). Therefore oscilloscope displays a
constant value as an error indication.

Saving Captured Data
--------------------

The data on IIO oscilloscope can be saved for further processing and analysis.
The data is saved using a .csv format. The data can be captured for each
selected channel during save option and only requested number of samples can be
saved. So if 400 samples are requested, the data for only 400 samples would get
saved into .csv file. The data is raw adc data and no extra processing is
performed it while saving or capturing.
