Installing and Activating CrossCore Embedded Studio
===================================================

.. admonition:: Download
   :class: download

   
   **Download CrossCore Embedded Studio 2.8.0 or greater:**
   
   .. container:: indent

      :adi:`CrossCore Embedded Studio <cces>`

   


**Note:** It is recommended that you install into the default directories recommended by the CrossCore Embedded Studios installer. This way all the instructions and support provided will be easier.

To install CrossCore Embedded Studio, double-click the installer executable (e.g. ``ADI_CrossCoreEmbeddedStudio-Rel2.10.0.exe``). By default the installer places all necessary components in the ``C:\Analog Devices\CrossCore Embedded Studio 2.10.0`` directory.

The first time you launch CrossCore Embedded Studio, you will be prompted to input a serial number, name, and email address. The serial number for **ALL** SHARC Audio Module boards is:

.. important::

   
   | SHARC Audio Module CrossCore Serial Number
   | ``EZK-CCES-9FYX-DSAC-FPNV-4WVP-E5X4-VGKC-GI01``
   


The New License Wizard will guide you through the process.

-  Select Yes to install a license at this time.
-  Choose "I have a serial number that I would like to activate" and click Next.
-  Enter the serial number above and click Next.
-  Choose "Install and activate a license on-line all in one step" and click Next.
-  Complete your name and address and click Finish.
-  Once you see the "Your license has been successfully activated" message click OK.

Once the serial number has been activated, the CrossCore development tools will be enabled to allow you to connect to the ADSP-SC589 processor using an ICE-1000 emulator.

.. warning::

   This license will only allow the use of ICE-1000 emulator hardware with CCES. If you have an ICE-2000 you will need a full CCES license.


Installing the SHARC Audio Module Bare Metal SDK
================================================

Configuring The Hardware For Use With CCES
==========================================

.. important::

   When using CCES, the emulator can introduce some noise into the audio output stream when running. Disconnecting from CCES will produce an unaltered audio stream.


In order to use the ICE-1000 to connect to the SHARC Audio Module main board be sure to connect the adapter and cable to the ICE-1000 as shown below:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/sharc-audio-module/hardware/ice_connections.jpg
   :width: 600px

The SHARC Audio Module main board must be powered and the ICE-1000 emulator must be connected to P1(DEBUG) as shown below:

If already familiar with CCES, continue on to the **Next** page using the Navigation section at the bottom of the page.

If not familiar with CCES, please go through the :doc:`CCES Getting Started Guide </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/crosscore/cces/getting-started>` prior to beginning the :doc:`Bare Metal Framework </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sharc-audio-module/baremetal>` page.

After completing the :doc:`Bare Metal Framework </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sharc-audio-module/baremetal>` there are various tutorials to go through in order to get familiar with the bare metal framework. It is recommended that you run the :doc:`Bare Metal Project Wizard </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sharc-audio-module/baremetal/project-wizard>` to create a starting point for each tutorial. Once you have a starting point, you can update specific options as needed. The tutorials will walk through changes that can be made to the code in order to get familiar with the various features that the framework provides.

Linux Add-In for the SHARC Audio Module
