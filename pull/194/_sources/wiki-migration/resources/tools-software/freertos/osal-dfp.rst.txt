OSAL DFP for FreeRTOS
=====================

For the Cortex-M33 core in the ADSP-SC83x family, an additional DFP is required
to provide OSAL for FreeRTOS. OSAL is the O/S Abstraction Layer and is used in
ADI library and driver code to support different O/S options via a consistent
API to avoid having to rebuild libraries. Currently support is available for
bare metal ("No-OS") and FreeRTOS. No-OS is installed by default, and FreeRTOS
needs an additional pack file to be installed.

Open the **CMSIS Pack Manager** via **Window** > **Perspective** > **Open Perspective** > **Other**, then select **CMSIS Pack Manager** and then click **Open**.
