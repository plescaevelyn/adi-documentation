An alternative to the :doc:`General-Purpose </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/toolbox/filters/general2ndorder>` filter, the Text-In block lets you set parameters using text fields, without having to open another window. The algorithms are the same, giving access to the wide variety of 2nd-order-filter behaviors, although not all the algorithms are offered with Text-In.

See the :doc:`General 2nd Order Algorithms </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/toolbox/algorithminformation/general2ndorderfilters>` page for information about the algorithms driving these blocks. The available filters are:

-  Parametric Filter
-  Shelving EQ: Low-Shelf
-  Shelving EQ: High-Shelf
-  General: Lowpass Filter
-  General: Highpass Filter
-  Peaking EQ
-  Notch EQ
-  General: Bandpass Filter
-  General: Bandstop Filter
-  Allpass filter

To use this block:

-  Drag into the workspace, right-click the block and select **Add Algorithm > IC N**.
-  Select your desired algorithm:

   -  Double-Precision
   -  Single-Precision

-  Click the blue icon to choose your filter: Peak, Lowpass, Highpass, Low-Shelf, High-Shelf.
-  Enter values in the param tab for Boost (Peak and Shelf EQ), Freq, Q/Slope.
   Click the right arrow and the gain tab and enter the filter gain.

   -  Boost is the amount of boost / cut applied to the designated frequency range
   -  Freq is the center frequency
   -  Q/slope is the sharpness of the curve
   -  Gain is the overall gain of filter.

As with other blocks, there's the option :doc:`Grow </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/usingsigmastudio/buildingschematics/algorithms>` this algorithm. Observe that with this block, growing the algorithm adds another frequency band to the block, which is equivalent to having two filters in series.
