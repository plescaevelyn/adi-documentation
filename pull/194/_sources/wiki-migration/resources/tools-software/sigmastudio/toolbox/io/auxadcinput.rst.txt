The Auxiliary ADC Input algorithm takes the digital signal from the auxiliary
A/D (analog-to-digital converter) and makes it available in the design.

.. note::

   Note: This block is only available for use with DSPs that have auxiliary ADC
   (e.g. ADAU1701).

Use the block's drop-down list control to select from the available ADC inputs.

-  Every enabled input must be connected to an output, else there will be errors on compilation.
-  Observe that as you drag more ADC input blocks into the schematic, the number of auxiliary ADCs available in the drop-down decreases because they can only be represented by one block at a time.
-  To change the Sampling Rate for an Aux ADC Input, Right-click the block name
   and select Set Sampling Rate, which brings up the Sampling Rate window
   (default is 44.1 kHz):
