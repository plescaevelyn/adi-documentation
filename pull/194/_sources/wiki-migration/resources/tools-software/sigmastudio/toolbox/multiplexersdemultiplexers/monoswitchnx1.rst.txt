The Mono Switch block routes one of many possible input signals to the output,
the strip of radio buttons is used to select the input signal (each radio button
corresponds to a coefficient RAM parameter).

To begin, drag the block into the workspace, right-click it and select Add
Algorithm > IC # Mono/Slew or Mono. The blocks look the same, but the Mono/Slew
algorithm performs a rapid fade-out fade-in of the source signals to prevent
clicking noises when switching among the inputs. For the AD1940 it uses one
hardware volume in the target/slew RAM per input to perform the slew.

The default block is ready to use as a 2x1 connection, and like the others can
be grown by right-clicking to select your desired number of inputs. Shown above
is the default block grown by 3 (= 5 inputs total).

See the Multiplexer/Demultiplexer Example utilizing this block.
