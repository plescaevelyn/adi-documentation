Route a stereo input to one of several possible stereo outputs with this block,
using the strip of radio button pairs to select which output.

To begin, drag the block into the workspace, right-click it and select Add
Algorithm > IC N Stereo/Slew or Stereo. (The result appears the same; this
default is shown at top right.) The Stereo/Slew algorithm lets you rapidly ramp
the stereo source level up and down without any clicking noises when switching
among the stereo outputs. It uses N hardware volume controls in the target/slew
RAM to do the job.

The default block shown above right is ready to use as a 2x4 connection, and
like the others can be grown by right-clicking to select your desired number of
stereo outputs. Below the default at right is a block grown by 3 (3 pairs,
equaling 6, totaling 10).
