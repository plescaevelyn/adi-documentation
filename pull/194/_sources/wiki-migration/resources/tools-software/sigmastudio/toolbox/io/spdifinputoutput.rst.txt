The SPDIF Input and Output blocks route signals between the schematic design and
the hardwares's SPDIF pins.

Use the input block's check boxes to enable or disable an input. Use the output
block's drop-down list control to select from the available SPDIF outputs.

Every enabled input must be connected to an output, else there will be errors on
compilation.

To change the SPDIF Input block's Sampling Rate , Right-click the block name and
select Set Sampling Rate, which brings up the Sampling Rate window (default is
44.1 kHz).

.. note::

   Note: These blocks are only available for use with DSPs that have SPDIF I/O.
