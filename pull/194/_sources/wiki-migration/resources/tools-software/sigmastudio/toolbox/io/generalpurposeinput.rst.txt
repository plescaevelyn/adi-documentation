The General Purpose Input block allows signals from the hardware's GPIO input
pins to be used in a schematic design. The orange output pin should typically be
connected to a GPIO Conditioning block.

There are 12 selectable inputs to this GPIO block.

.. note::

   Note: The block is only available for DSPs that include GPIO. To configure
   the hardware's GPIO input and outputs settings, see the processors Register
   Control Window.

Select the channel desired for sending your signal using the General Purpose
Input drop-down control.

-  Every enabled input must be connected to an output, else there will be errors on compilation.
-  Observe that as you drag more output blocks to your schematic, your number of input channels available in the drop-down decreases.
-  To change the Sampling Rate for the Input, Right-click the block name and
   select Set Sampling Rate, which brings up the Sampling Rate window (default
   is 44.1 kHz):
