The Seven-Band Level Detector block calculates the input signal level, reading
directly from the hardware in real time, and displays the level graphically in
seven frequency band meter displays:

-  <100Hz
-  250Hz
-  500Hz
-  1kHz
-  2.5kHz
-  5kHz
-  >10kHz

The level detector performs analysis only and does not modify the input signal.
The signal at the output pin is identical to the input.

Use the On / Off button to enable or disable the display. The level detector
will not function until the schematic design has been compiled and downloaded to
the hardware and a USB communication channel is properly configured.

Note: The refresh rate of the display is approximately 10 Hz. The display's
performance is limited by your PC system and USB bandwidth. Using multiple level
detectors may degrade the responsiveness.
