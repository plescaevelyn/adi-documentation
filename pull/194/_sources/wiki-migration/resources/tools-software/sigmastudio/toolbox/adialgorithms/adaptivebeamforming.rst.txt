| The 2-channel SigmaDSP Beamformer uses a modified version of the so-called “Griffiths-Jim” Beamformer (1). This beamformer can track a single source of off-axis interference and place a null in the directional pattern, pointed at the source of the interference. The Block Diagram of this beamformer is shown below. | |image2| |

The left/right microphone inputs are first applied to a highpass filter to
remove DC components. The filter cutoff frequency is 15Hz for Fs = 24KHz.

The “steering direction” is set by the difference in delays between the two
inputs. The right channel contains a fixed input delay of 8 samples, and the
left channel has a variable delay from 0 to 16 samples, allowing the left
channel to either lead or lag the right channel by up to 8 samples. The
directional pattern has maximum sensitivity when the outputs of the two delay
blocks are the same. The corresponding source angle can be computed based on the
sample-rate and microphone spacing. The pin “intermic_delay” should be connected
to an external DC source, and is designed so that with 0 input the left-channel
delay is equal to the right-channel delay (8 samples). This pin has a
sensitivity of 1 LSB per sample delay. If this pin is connected to an external
DC source, the numeric format of the DC block can be set to “28.0” so that the
inter-mic delay can be entered directly in samples, with values between -8 and
+8.

The outputs of the delay blocks are summed in the upper path, and differenced in
the lower path. Before the difference operation, a microphone matching algorithm
is used that attempts to match the amplitudes of the two microphones. This will
result in reduced sensitivity to microphone gain tolerances, but it should be
noted that the microphones still need to be tightly matched in terms of phase
response.

The difference signal is then applied to an IIR lowpass filter which attempts to
pre-compensate the expected rising response of the microphone difference signal,
and then applied to an normalized adaptive filter which attempts to remove any
L-R components that are present in the L+R signal. In theory the L-R signal
should go to zero for signals in the “look” direction, but in practice this does
not occur due largely to room acoustics. This can potentially allow the adaptive
filter to also eliminate the desired signal. To prevent this, a limit is placed
on the maximum mean-square value of the filter coefficients. Since the value of
this parameter depends on room acoustics, it is made adjustable by the user. In
practice this parameter controls how close the adaptive null direction can be
relative to the “look direction”. Smaller values should be used in highly
reverberant environments to prevent accidental cancellation of the desired
signal. For off-axis interfering signals, the L-R signal is large enough due to
the left/right phase differences that the adaptive filter does not need to have
a large gain in order to cancel the L-R component, and therefore the mean-square
coefficient limit is never reached. A typical value for this parameter is around
0.02.

The normalized adaptive filter also exposes parameters for “alpha”, which
controls adaptation speed, “leak”, which controls the LMS coefficient leakage
factor, and the filter length which can be set to 32, 64, or 128. These
parameters are well-covered in the literature on adaptive filters. Note that the
default parameters are set with an assumed sample-rate of 24KHz, and for other
sample-rates the value for alpha should be adjusted inversely to the
sample-rate. If the “leak” factor is set to 1.0, then the null that forms in a
particular direction will persist even when the input signal goes away, whereas
if the leak factor is set to, for example, 0.99999, the filter will slowly decay
to zero after the signal has gone away. If the leak factor is set too low, the
depth of the directional null will be poor.

A pin is also provided to turn on and off the adaptive algorithm. Applying a 0
to this pin turns the adaptive filter off, and “1.0” enables the adaptive
filter.

To extend this algorithm to more than two microphones, you can cascade systems
as shown below. Note that one microphone (mic 2) has a fixed delay in both upper
and lower paths, and the other 2 mics are adjusted relative to mic2 in order to
steer the beam. Note that for a 4-microphone systems, up to 3 independent
off-axis interfering sources can be tracked and canceled.

The details of the mic matching algorithm are shown below. Note that the goal of
this algorithm is to minimize the correlation between L-R and L+R. For
closely-spaced mics this amounts to compensating for gain mismatch, but for
larger mic spacing (or for very high frequencies) where the phase difference
between the mics becomes large, it may not yield the same result as simple gain
mismatch reduction.
