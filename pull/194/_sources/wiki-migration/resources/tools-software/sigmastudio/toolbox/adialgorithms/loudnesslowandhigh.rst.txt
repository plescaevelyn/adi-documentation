Loudness (Low and High)
=======================

:doc:`Click here to return to the ADI Algorithms page </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/toolbox/adialgorithms>`

For low levels, the Loudness (Low and High) block raises bass <60 Hz and also
the treble >7kHz (but see below about the control knobs).

The boost values are derived from the well-known equal-loudness curves of
Fletcher and Munson and others. This research revealed that at low levels, lows
and highs need to be considerably louder in order for the tonal balance to sound
correctly proportioned and the overall sound to have the same apparent loudness
to the human ear.

Note that this algorithm is fixed, not dynamic: it assumes the input level is
constant.

This block's parameters include the level slider, LPF and HPF knobs, and Level.

1) The level slider controls the output volume of the entire signal, but, more
   important, it is also the control for the loudness algorithm. At low levels,
   the loudness algorithm boosts the low frequencies somewhat more than it does
   the high frequencies. At 0dB, no matter what the input level is, there is no
   boost, LF or HF.

2) The LP knob lets you change the cutoff of the lowpass filter. The default
   value approximates the Fletcher-Munson curve. Higher-frequency values provide
   greater bass-bandwidth gain.

3) The HF knob let you change the cutoff frequency of the highpass filter. The
   default value of 7kHz approximates the Fletcher-Munson curve.
