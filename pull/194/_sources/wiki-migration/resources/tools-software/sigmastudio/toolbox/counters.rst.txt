Counters, timers and stopwatches help achieve time based conditional event
triggering. In many applications it is important to be able to track time that
has passed in order to trigger events, or turn flags on and off, or find out how
long it takes to finish a task. It is also useful to trigger the start and stop
of counting based on external signals.

Some typical applications include counting time during which a product is
inactive in order to power-down the device after a certain time threshold of
inactivity is met. Other more generic examples include sequencing of events
depending on time that has passed. Thus counters can be used to pause the signal
flow; a certain amount of time can be specified to wait for, and then the output
will trigger the next event to occur.

In some applications is useful to enter an actual value that sets the counter,
whereas in other situations, the signal flow should determine when the counting
begins, ends and is reset. SigmaStudio offers a wide range of timing algorithms
that allow for flexible control of the counting method.
