The Mono Switch block routes an input signal to one of many possible outputs,
the strip of radio buttons is used to select an output (each radio button
corresponds to a coefficient RAM parameter).

To begin, drag the block into the workspace, right-click it and select Add
Algorithm > IC N Mono/Slew or Mono. (The result appears the same.) The Mono/Slew
algorithm lets you rapidly ramp the source level up and down without any
clicking noises when switching outputs. It uses N hardware volume controls in
the target/slew RAM to do its job.

See the Multiplexer/Demultiplexer Example utilizing this block.

The default block is ready to use as a 1x2 connection, and like the others can
be grown by right-clicking and selecting the desired number of outputs. The
example below has been grown by 3:
