Midnight Mode
=============

Our Midnight Mode block is a dynamic-processing algorithm designed primarily for
handling explosive movie soundtracks or similar material (video games, e.g.) to
make them less obtrusive. A typical example would be quiet night-time
environments where loud transients and similar sounds would disturb people (not
to mention sleeping children and babies) in a room adjacent to or near the home
theater or gaming area.

With Midnight Mode, high-level passages are attenuated and very quiet levels are
readily raised into audibility, while dialog remains unchanged and intelligible.
This permits higher overall levels with better clarity for the intended active
listeners, with much less chance of disturbing nearby non-listeners.

*Notes*

-  This compressor block defaults to a bypassed state. Click the toggle switch to enable Midnight Mode.
-  The Input slider works as a volume control, changing the level into the Midnight Mode algorithm. If the block is bypassed, the slider is throughput volume control.
-  The Output slider adjusts the output level post-compressor.

*How It Works*

Source material with a very wide dynamic range -- the "distance" from the very
quietest to the very loudest levels -- must have its dynamics reduced for
comfortable domestic playback, especially at night or similar times when high
movie (or music) levels are inappropriate and undesirable. If the source
material has a dynamic range of 60dB, say, the output dynamic range will be
compressed to more comfortable 40dB.

The processing is centered on a nominal source level. Signals louder than this normal-level transition point get reduced in level, or made quieter, and the signals below this point get boosted in level, made louder. Refer to the figure below, which shows, along the horizontal axis, the input range from -10 (20 above the nominal -30dB input) to 20 below it (= -50dB) — with the compressor action demonstrated by the vertical axis, which shows outputs at -28, -40, and -50dB levels.

*Gating*

Now, very quiet sound is treated differently; see the figure below. The block is
able to avoid such side effects as can occur with advanced compression, like
modulation of the noise floor by very loud signals. The oval portion shows a
noise gate (a downward expander), a function that sharply reduces low-level hum
and other noise.

*Gain structure*

The enabled input slider works as a volume control, changing the input gain to
the Midnight Mode processing, and moves the point where the nominal signal lands
on the curve, up or down. The output slider moves the entire curve up or down.

*Recommendation*

-  Input set to -6dB
-  Output set to +14dB

bypassed (top) and enabled (bottom). Notice not only the control of the FX scene
but the unchanged processing (volume) of the low-level voice signal.
