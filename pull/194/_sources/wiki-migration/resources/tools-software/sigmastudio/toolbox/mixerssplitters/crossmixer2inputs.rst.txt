The Cross-Mixer (2 inputs) allows two input signals to be mixed, with variable
gain, down to one output signal.

There are two control knobs for setting the gain, one knob for each input pin.
To set the gain, click the knob with the left mouse button and drag while
holding the button down. Each knob's range, value, and step size can be
customized by right-clicking on the knob control.

To add additional mixer outputs, you can perform Grow Algorithm on this block
(right-click and select Grow Algorithm from the menu), increasing the number of
output pins, as shown below. This example features growth by 4, resulting in
five total outputs. (The maximum is +9.) This allows you to create different
mixes from the same inputs.

You can also add additional mixer algorithms to the block by right-clicking and
selecting Add Algorithm from the menu. Adding an algorithm creates another set
of input/output pins and control knobs. Each block algorithm is independent. See
the Add Algorithm topic for more information.

This second mixer control is entirely separate even though it appears on the
same block. You can add additional algorithms; the input to output ratio will
always be 2:1.

It is also possible to perform Grow and Add Algorithm on the same block. In this
situation it is important to keep track of input and output pin relationships.
Below is a design with a mixer block containing two algorithms, the first grown
by 2, the second grown by 1. The colored boxes indicate the mixer configuration
and the corresponding input/output pins.
