Use the radio buttons in this multi-channel block to select among sets of 8
inputs and send one set to one of the (8-channel) outputs.

To begin, drag the block into the workspace, right-click it and select Add
Algorithm > IC # > 8 Channel/Slew or 8 Channel. (The result, shown at right top,
appears the same either way.)

The 8 Channel/Slew algorithm lets you rapidly ramp the source level up and down
without any clicking noises when switching among outputs. It uses N hardware
volume controls in the target/slew RAM to do the job.

The default block (above right) is ready to use as a 2x1 connection, and like
the others can be grown by right-clicking to select your desired number of input
sets. At lower right is the default grown by 5 (= 7 input sets total).
