ADI Surround uses matrix-surround decoding techniques: deriving five channels of
output from a two-channel input. This process entails using a sum channel (the
combination of the left and right channels, L+R), which contains frontal
information, and a difference channel (the difference between the left and right
channels, L-R / R-L), which contains ambiance information.

Depending on the blending and distribution of the difference channel with the
sum channel, we can derive the left, right, center, and side or rear surround
channels. The L and R front speakers carry music, frontal sound effects, and
directional dialog; the center speaker carries the rest (meaning most) of the
dialog, and the surround speakers (ideally placed to the side of and slightly
above the listeners) provide ambiance and surround effects.

ADI Surround has presets for the following modes:

-  Club
-  Music
-  Stadium
-  Cinema
-  Hall
-  Rock
-  Jazz
-  User1
-  User2
-  User3

It also features two room sizes:

-  Size1 = small
-  Size2 = large

The schematic shown below features an input block (two-channel), ADI Surround
(configuration = Club, size = small) and output blocks.
