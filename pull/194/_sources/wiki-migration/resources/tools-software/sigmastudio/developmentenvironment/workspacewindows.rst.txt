Workspace Windows
=================

:doc:`Click here to return to the Development Environment page </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/developmentenvironment>`

The Workspace windows display important project information including available
resources, compiler output, and hardware communication. To show or hide the
workspace windows select them in the application's main View menu or by clicking
the buttons on the Standard Toolbar.

-  DSP Resources
-  Output
-  Capture Window
-  Sequence Window

Each window is described below:

--------------

DSP Resources:
--------------

The DSP Resources window lets you view the resources available in your design,
depending on your project complexity. You are able to monitor program RAM,
parameter RAM, and other hardware-specific resources. By default this window is
docked on the right side of the program window.

--------------

Output:
-------

The Output window is a quick way to view the files generated upon linking,
compiling, and other actions in the Schematic workspace. By default this window
is docked on the right side of the program window. Note, you can also find this
information by locating the project's output folder and reading the compiler
output files. For more information about those files, see Compile/Downloading
Your Project.

.. tip::

   Note: The DSP Resources and Output windows are not fully functional for all
   SigmaDSP IC types.

--------------

Capture Window:
---------------

The capture window lets you see, in real time, the exact data that SigmaStudio
is sending to the hardware. This window is only active when a USB communication
channel is inserted in the project and the project has been compiled and
downloaded. This window is un-docked/floating by default.

The window is empty when it opens initially, but after you press
Link-Compile-Download you will see the data that is downloaded to the board:
coefficients, parameter addresses, and parameter data. Whenever you make
adjustments to sliders or control in a compiled and downloaded schematic, you
can see the data that is sent.

See Capture Output Data for a detailed explanation of the data displayed in the
Capture Window.

--------------

Sequence Window:
----------------

Use the sequence window to define a custom sequence of data read/write
operations between SigmaStudio and a target hardware device connected via USB.
Commands can be dragged from the capture window or created manually. Sequences
are independent of the SigmaStudio project file and can be saved and recalled to
files.

The sequence window is part of the Capture window, to view the sequence window
open the capture window and click the arrow button in the upper right corner.
