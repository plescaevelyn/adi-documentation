Step 1: Before You Install
--------------------------

-  Quit any applications you are running. This is not strictly required for SigmaStudio, but is generally good practice while installing new software.

Step 2: Application Setup
-------------------------

-  Run the setup application (named similarly to ``ADI_SigmaStudio-Rel4.5-x64.exe``). On managed corporate machines, it's recommended to run the installer elevated.
-  Review the contents of the license agreement.
-  The installer will proceed through the rest of the installation.

Step 3: Driver Installation
---------------------------

In most cases, driver installation is performed alongside SigmaStudio. If your machine is the rare exception, please follow these steps:

-  Connect the USB cable between your evaluation hardware and a PC USB port.
-  If this is your first time connecting the USB device, the Windows "Found New Hardware Wizard" will launch.
-  If prompted, choose “Install from a list or a specific location” and click "Next".
-  Select “Search for the best driver in these locations” and check the box for “Include this location in the search.”
-  Press the "Browse" button and locate the appropriate driver file in the SigmaStudio application folder (default folder is C:\\Program Files\\Analog Devices Inc\\Sigma Studio X.Y\\USB drivers, where X.Y represents the release version of the software)

   -  For **USB serial converter** and Eval-Boards (FDTIxx.inf) select **ftd2xx.inf** file.

      -  Any evaluation board sold after 2007 uses the USBi interface, but the FTDI drivers are included for backwards-compatibility.

   -  For the **USBi** interface select **CyUSB.inf file**.

-  Click "Continue Anyway" if you're prompted with "This software has not passed Windows Logo testing."

Step 4: Hardware Configuration
------------------------------

-  Setup the Evaluation hardware jumpers and I/O configurations, refer to Evaluation Board documentation available on the web at :adi:`SigmaDSP Evaluation Boards </en/content/sigmadsp_evaluation_boards/fca.html>`.
-  For additional help, see the Evaluation Board Setup Examples.
-  If you are using the USBi, there is a quick way to verify that the driver is installed properly. Make a new project and drag in a USBi object from the ToolBox. The "USBi" text is highlighted green when the USBi is detected, and red when disconnected.

It is rare for users to have issues during installation. If something does come up, please create a new question in the :ez:`SigmaDSP EngineerZone <dsp/sigmadsp>` forum and describe what is happening.
