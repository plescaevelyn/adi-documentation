Register Read/Write Window
==========================

:doc:`Click here to return to the Hardware Windows page. </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/developmentenvironment/hardware_windows>`

The Register Read/Write window allows you to read and write bytes of data from
and to a DSP IC, for some DSPs it also performs program file loading and data
capture.

To access the Register Control window:

-  Click the Hardware Configuration tab at the top of the workspace.
-  Right-click on the DSP processor block, (click outside of the part number field, e.g. AD1701) to display the context menu.
-  Select Read/Write Window from the menu.

Register Read/Write
-------------------

This window allows you to read and write bytes of data directly to Parameter
RAM, Program RAM, Target/Slew RAM, and available registers, which is useful for
sending specific parameters directly to the DSP and also checking parameter
values that have been sent.

-  For writing, set the address, number of bytes, the data to be written, and click Write.
-  For reading, set the address and number of bytes, and click Read. These
   values will be displayed.

.. tip::

   Note: Only 28 bits of the 32 available are used, so the 4 MSBs of the first
   hex value are zero-padded from the 4th bit. (This is different from the
   Capture Output Data window and params file, which are sign-extended from the
   fourth bit.) It also is important to keep in mind that Register Read is
   actually reading parameters back from the DSP, whereas Capture Output Data
   and params file are reading the parameters being sent.

Data Capture
------------

These functions allow any node in the signal-processing flow to be sent to
control-port-readable registers or to a digital output pin, provided it's
supported by your particular hardware settings. This can be used to monitor and
display information about internal signal levels or compressor / limiter
activity. The digital output registers are output on SDATA_OUT7 when the
data-capture serial-out enable bit (bit 14) is set in serial output control
register 2. (This is AD1940-specific). Clicking Enable DCS Out sets this bit for
you.

-  Read the generated trap.dat file by clicking Read Trap File, which will populate the lists with the available TRAP addresses.
-  Select one of the 6 independent control-port-readable data-capture registers (SPI 0-5) or one of two digital output capture registers (DCS 0/1).
-  Select the Net Name and its count that you wish to capture. The count corresponds to the program step number where the capture will occur.
-  Select the register for output. This register will be transferred to the
   data-capture register when the program counter equals the capture count.
   Options are:

   -  Mult_X_input - multiplier X input
   -  Mult_Y_input - multiplier Y input
   -  MAC_out - multiplier-accumulator output
   -  Accum_fback - accumulator feedback

-  Click Read to see the data. The captured data are in 5.19 twos-complement
   data format, the 4 LSBs truncated from the internal 5.23 dataword.

Load Files
----------

These functions allow loading a previously compiled program or parameter file to
the hardware, provided this feature is support by your particular DSP part. This
can be used to quickly compare project settings.

To load a file:

-  Click the "Click here to browse for program/parameter file" control.
-  Locate the \*.dat file you wish to load (e.g. hex_program_data.dat) and click open, he numerical control will display the size of the program bytes.
-  Press Load to send data to the hardware.

File load functionality for the AD1940/AD1940 is available through the `Imploader <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/developmentenvironment/hardware_windows/imploader>`_.
