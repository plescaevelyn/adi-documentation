Using SigmaStudio as a LabVIEW .NET Server
==========================================

To use SigmaStudio as a LabVIEW automation client, both applications must be
installed and running on the same machine. In this configuration, LabVIEW is a
.NET automation client and SigmaStudio (via SigmaStudioServer) becomes a .NET
automation server.

To create a virtual instrument to control SigmaStudio, follow the steps given
below:

1. Launch LabVIEW and SigmaStudio on the same machine, and then open a new VI
   file in LabVIEW

2. Open the .NET palette to access the .NET objects.

3. Insert a Constructor Node which will open the Select .NET Constructor dialog
   box.

5. Navigate to the SigmaStudio installation directory, select
   Analog.SigmaStudioServer.dll and press OK.

6. Next choose SigmaStudioServer from the object list, SigmaStudioServer()
   should be displayed in the constructors list.

7. Click OK to select the SigmaStudioServer constructor.

8. Insert an Invoke Node and connect the constructor Node to it.

9. Click on Method to display and select the accessible SigmaStudioServer
   commands.

11. Example VI for sequence of operations "open project" -> "Compile
    ->"Download"

Please download the following example LabView 2015 and edit paths as necessary `labvieweaxample.rar <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/usingsigmastudio/scripting/labvieweaxample.rar>`_

Refer to the LabVIEW online help and tutorials for more information; the “Using
.NET with LabVIEW” online help topic is a good place to start.

.. note::

   All APIs in SigmaStudioServer.dll might not be exposed to LabView interface.
   Still, these APIs can be accessed by calling the using the RUN_SCRIPT()
   method which accesses these APIs internally.
