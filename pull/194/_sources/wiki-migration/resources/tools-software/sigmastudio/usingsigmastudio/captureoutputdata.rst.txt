Capture Output Data
===================

:doc:`Click here to return to the Using Sigma Studio page </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/usingsigmastudio>`

The :doc:`Capture Window </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/developmentenvironment/workspacewindows>` shows, in real time, the data SigmaStudio is sending to the hardware. This includes data sent during compile/link/download, register read/write operations, and changes to schematic block controls. The following example provides an explanation of the data displayed in the capture window.

**Output Capture Example :**

This example uses the AD1940 DSP and the sample schematic shown below: utilizing a White-Noise Source, Medium Size EQ Filter (single precision), and Output block.

Display the Capture Window by selecting **View - Capture Window** in the application's main menu or by clicking the button on the :doc:`Standard Toolbar </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/sigmastudio/developmentenvironment/toolbars>`.

Select the Schematic tab and compile/link/download the project. The compiled program data is downloaded to the hardware and displayed in the Capture Window.

-  For the AD1940, the first data sent is to mute the board. You can see that the parameter address for muting is 2642 and the values are 0x00 0x00.

-  Next is the program code block, starting at address 1024, and utilizing 165 of the available 7680 byte program memory. Click the plus button in the left-hand column to expand this row and see all the data values.

-  The following row is the parameter data, address 0, which is updated in real time as you can see once you make changes to sliders, control knobs, etc. on a compiled schematic.

-  The next write message is across 5 registers, addresses 2642-2646 (8 total bytes), configuring the RAM, serial output, and Serial Inputs.

-  This block of code is to configure the AD1940's slew ram, at address 2560. Note that this is shown if green because it is a Safeload write.

-  The final row is the un-mute message. Observe that the address is again 2642, as with the mute command, but now the data values have changed to un-mute the hardware.

--------------

At this point you can click **Clear All Output Data** button to empty the capture window. Now try moving the EQ slider to see that as the values are changed they are sent to the DSP.

**Cell Name** - Same name as appears on the visual block in the SigmaStudio schematic tab.

**Parameter Name** - Describes the algorithm, IC type, number of inputs, and for this example the filter coefficient.

**Parameter Address** - The address where data are being sent.

**Parameter Value** - The decimal equivalent value for filter coefficient.

**Parameter Data** - 4-byte hex representation of the filter coefficient. The DSP takes data in 5.23 format, 5 bits to the left of the decimal point and 23 bits to the right. The hex values listed here are the 4 bytes necessary to store the 28 bits. Only 28 bits of the 32 available are used, so the 4 most significant bits of the first hex value are sign-extended from the 4th bit.
