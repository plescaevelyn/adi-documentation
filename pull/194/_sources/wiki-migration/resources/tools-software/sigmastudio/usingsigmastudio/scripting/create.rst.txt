Creating and Running SigmaStudio Scripts
========================================

SigmaStudio scripts allow project files to be created and manipulated using
textual commands. The scripting interface is defined in the C# language and
supports scripts written in either C# or Visual Basic languages. No previous
knowledge of C# is required to write simple SigmaStudio scripts.

SigmaStudio scripts can be created in any text editor or within SigmaStudio
using the “Script Editor” tool. The Script Editor provides IntelliPrompt display
of the script interfaces and syntax highlighting functionality. Script files can
be saved as text files (\*.txt) or SigmaStudio Script files (\*.sss). Scripts
are loaded and run, pause, and stop from the Script Editor window. Pause, Resume
and Stop supports by adding the "ALLOW_PAUSE_STOP() " API in Script.

Opening the Script Editor
-------------------------

In SigmaStudio, click on ToolsScript in main menu to start the Script Editor
shown in Figure 2.

To create a new script file, open the Script Editor window and click File  New (or CTRL + N). This creates a new script file and automatically inserts ``“// #LANGUAGE# C#”`` on the first line. This identifies the script language as C# (c-sharp) the default SigmaStudio scripting language. Visual Basic scripts are also supported. The language identifier is optional for C# scripts but is required for Visual Basic scripts.

C# (c-sharp) script language identifier — #LANGUAGE# C#

Visual Basic script language identifier — #LANGUAGE# VB

Writing a Script
----------------

To access the IScripted interface list, type “sigmastudio” (or optionally “ss”)
followed by a period in the Script Editor window. This will display the
IntelliPrompt window listing all available IScripted methods. (“sigmastudio” and
“ss” are public references to the SigmaStudio IScripted interface, see the
following usage example).

An example script is given below:

.. code:: csharp

   // #LANGUAGE# C#
   sigmastudio.ProjectNew();
   sigmastudio.ObjectInsert( "USBi" );
   sigmastudio.ObjectInsert( "ADSP-214xx" );
   sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "USB Interface", 0, "IC 1", 0 );
   sigmastudio.ObjectInsert( "Audio Input" );
   sigmastudio.ObjectInsert( "Output" );
   sigmastudio.ObjectInsert( "Output" );
   sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Audio Input1", 0, "Output1", 0 );
   sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Audio Input1", 1, "Output2", 0 );
   sigmastudio.ProjectLinkCompileDownload();
   sigmastudio.ProjectSaveAs( @"C:\SStudioProjects\SampleScript.dspproj" );
   sigmastudio.ProjectClose();

This example creates a new project, inserts an ADSP-214xx processor and a USB
communication channel, and connects them with a wire. Next, it inserts an input
object and 2 output objects, connecting the 2 input pins to the output object
pins. The project is then linked, compiled, downloaded, saved to disk and
closed.

Running a Script
----------------

To run a SigmaStudio Script, in the Script Editor Window, click on main menu Tools > RunScript or press “F5”, see Figure 3. |image1| Figure 3: Running Script

If there are any errors in the script code, a dialog detailing the errors is displayed and “Script Failure” is shown in the status bar. If the script successfully compiles and runs, “Success” is shown in the Script Editor status bar. |image2| Figure 4: Script Error

Pause and Resume a Script
-------------------------

To pause a SigmaStudio Script, in the Script Editor Window, click on main menu
Tools > Pause, see Figure 5.

|image3|

if the script successfully paused, "Paused" is shown in the Script Editor status
bar. Figure 5: Pause Script

To Resume a SigmaStudio Script, in the Script Editor Window, click on main menu Tools > Resume, see Figure 6. |image4| Figure 6: Resume Script

Stop a Script
-------------

To stop a SigmaStudio Script, in the Script Editor Window, click on main menu
Tools > Stop, see Figure 7.

|image5|

if the script successfully stops, a dialog detailing the script execution halted
is displayed and “Script Aborted” is shown in the status bar.

|image6|

Object Names
------------

To reference Schematic objects contained in hierarchy boards, the complete
object name must be used. The “complete name” consists of the object’s name
preceded by the names of all parent Hierarchy boards separated by periods (‘.’).

For example, in Figure 5 “Filter2” is contained in a Hierarchy board named
“Board1”. The complete name of this object is “Board1.Filter2”.

|image7| Figure 5: Script Object Name Usage

The following script would remove the Filter2 object:

.. code:: csharp

   sigmastudio.ObjectRemove( "Board1.Filter2" );

In the next example (Figure 6), Board2 is contained within Board1, so the full
name of object in Board2 includes both board names, “Board1.Board2.Gen 1st
Order1”.

Advanced Script Support
-----------------------

Scripts are not limited to the IScripted interface functions. Scripts can take
advantage of the C# language and some elements of the .NET framework. A sample
script to add object to a Schematic, modify its attributes and interconnect them
is given below.

.. code:: csharp

   // #LANGUAGE# C#
   ss.ProjectOpen( @"C:\SStudioProjects\SampleScript.dspproj");
   ss.ObjectDisconnect( "Audio Input1", 0, "Output1", 0 );
   ss.ObjectDisconnect( "Audio Input1", 1, "Output2", 0 );

   try
   {
       int nNumFilters = 4;
       for (int i = 0; i < nNumFilters; ++i)
       {
           object oFilter = ss.ObjectInsert( "General (2nd order)" );
           if (null != oFilter)
           {
               string strNewName = "Filter_" + (i + 1);
               ss.ObjectSetProperties( "setName", oFilter, strNewName );
               ss.ObjectSetProperties( "addAlgorithm", strNewName, "IC 1", "2 Channel - Single Precision" );
           }
           else
           {
               throw new Exception( "ln 11" );
           }
       }
       HResult hr = HResult.S_OK;
       for (int ixPin = 0; ixPin < 2; ++ixPin)
       {
           if (HResult.S_OK != sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Audio Input1",ixPin, "Filter_1", ixPin ))
               throw new Exception( "ln 28" );
           if (HResult.S_OK != sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Filter_1", ixPin, "Filter_2", ixPin ))
               throw new Exception( "ln 31" );
           if (HResult.S_OK != sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Filter_2", ixPin, "Filter_3", ixPin ))
               throw new Exception( "ln 34" );
           if (HResult.S_OK != sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Filter_3", ixPin, "Filter_4", ixPin ))
               throw new Exception( "ln 37" );
       }
       if (HResult.S_OK != sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Filter_4", 0, "Output1", 0 ))
           throw new Exception( "ln 42" );
       if (HResult.S_OK != sigmastudio.ObjectConnect( "Filter_4", 1, "Output2", 0 ))
           throw new Exception( "ln 45" );
   }
   catch(Exception e)
   {
       System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show( "FAILURE: " + e.ToString() );
   }
