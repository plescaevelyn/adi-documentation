Schematic version control allows the users to maintain version numbers for a
particular schematic. This feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled by
using write click context menu on the IC as shown below. This is currently
supported only for ADAU145X Sigma DSPs.

There are 2 version numbers, one is major and another minor. The minor can be
incremented manually. The major version is incremented whenever there is a
change in the schematic (code change) and the compilation is done. The major
version can also be overridden by the user.

There is an extra field for "Customer ID" which can be enabled optionally. This
is updated manually by the users. The Last three memory locations of DM1 memory
are used to maintain these version numbers.
