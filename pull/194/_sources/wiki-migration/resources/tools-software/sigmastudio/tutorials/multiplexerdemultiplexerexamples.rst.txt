Example 1: Crossfade (Data-Controlled)
--------------------------------------

This schematic shows a simple way of smoothly switching (crossfading) from one
signal to the other (here 500 Hz and 2kHz). It uses these blocks: DC Input
control entry, two Tone (Lookup/Sine), Crossfade (Data-Controlled), and Output.

Example 2: Index-Selectable Mux/DeMux
-------------------------------------

This schematic shows a simple way of multiplexing two sources and then
demultiplexing the signals to two outputs. Two Tone (Lookup/Sine) blocks feed an
Index-Selectable Multiplexer, with the switching between them controlled by a DC
Input. The output goes to an Index-Selectable Demultiplexer, whose behavior is
controlled by a second DC Input Entry to feed two Outputs.

Example 3: Mono Switch
----------------------

This schematic uses Mono Switch 1xN and Mono Switch Nx1 flanking a General
(2nd-Order) Filter grown by 2. The filter frequency response choice is highpass
and the highpassed signal is routed to the output. Tone (Lookup/Sine), Probe,
Stimuli and Output blocks complete the signal flow.

Below is the frequency response of the HP filter.

Example 4: Stereo Switch
------------------------

This schematic shows a simple way of multiplexing two sources using two
State-Variable filters, Stereo Switch Nx2, Input and Output blocks. The filters'
high-pass outputs are selected and routed to the output blocks.

Example 5: State Machine
------------------------

This schematic uses a Counter as the control, a Tone (Lookup/Sine) and a State
Machine block, in order to show how the tone passed through to the output is
blocked once the count goes beyond the specified range.
