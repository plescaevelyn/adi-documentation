ADSP-214xx Hardware Setup
=========================

Requirements
------------

The following are the list of hardware components required for setting up the
demo application.

-  ADSP-21489 EZ-KIT Lite.
-  PC/Laptop with a stereo audio out and USB port.
-  ADZS-ICE-2000/ICE-1000 emulator for downloading/debugging/flashing the framework to the Target.
-  EVAL-ADUSB2EBZ USB to SPI converter.
-  ADZS-USBI2EZB is an adapter board used to connect EVAL-ADUSB2EBZ socket to the EZ-KIT Lite.
-  Aardvark I2C/SPI Host Adapter
-  Audio cables and USB cables.

Setup
-----

The SigmaStudio+ demonstration setup for ADSP-214xx includes a Host PC running
SigmaStudio+ which is connected to the ADSP-21489 EZ-KIT Lite. The connection is
achieved using a USB-to-SPI converter. The EVAL-ADUSB2EBZ or Aardvark I2C/SPI
acts as the USB-to-SPI converter, which is connected to the PC through a USB
port and to the Target EZ-KIT Lite through SPI lines using ADZS-USBI2EZB. The
basic steps to set up the Target for SigmaStudio+ demonstration are given below.

Connections

Connect EZ-BOARD to PC using USBi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-ADUSB2EBZ (hereafter referred to as the ‘USBi’) has a 10 pin socket and
each EZ-KIT has a different header to which the SPI lines connect. Hence an
adapter board ADZS-USBI2EZB (hereafter referred to as the ‘adapter board’) is
used to connect the USBi socket to the EZ-KIT. The adapter board connects to the
primary SPI of the respective EZ-KIT. The USBi should be connected to P1 of the
adapter board. When connected, Pin 1 of the USBi socket should match pin 1 of
header P1 on the adapter board. LED1 on the adapter board is ON only if the
connection is correct.

Connect EZ-Board to PC using Aardvark I2C/SPI Host Adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect Aardvark I2C/SPI Host Adapter to the PC running SigmaStudio using a USB
cable. Aardvark I2C/SPI Host Adapter has a 10 pin socket and each EZ-KIT has a
different header to which the SPI lines connect. Hence an adapter board
ADZS-USBI2EZB (hereafter referred to as the ‘adapter board’) is used to connect
the Aardvark socket to the EZ-KIT. The adapter board connects to the primary SPI
of the respective EZ-KIT. The Aardvark should be connected to P1 of the adapter
board. When connected, Pin 1 of the Aardvark socket should match pin 1 of header
P1 on the adapter board. LED1 on the adapter board is ON only if the connection
is correct.

Connect Audio Input and Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect an analog audio source and headphones/speakers to the audio ports on the
EZ-KIT.

Connect Power to the EZ-KIT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect the power and reset the board by pressing the ‘RESET’ button on the
EZ-BOARD.
