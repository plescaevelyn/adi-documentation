Blind A/B Preset Testing
========================

**Blind A/B Preset Testing** is a feature used to compare two Tuning Presets (A/B/C/D Presets) to determine which one sounds better, without the user knowing which preset is being used. This helps eliminate bias and ensures that the results are more reliable.

This feature can be launched by selecting "**Blind A/B Preset Testing**" from the **Tools** menu. This feature will be active only if at least two of the A/B/C/D presets are available for comparison.
