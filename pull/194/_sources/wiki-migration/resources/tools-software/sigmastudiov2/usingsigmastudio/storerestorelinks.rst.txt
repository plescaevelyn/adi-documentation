Store/Restore Links
===================

In SigmaStudio+, it is possible to connect multiple modules to the output pin of
a given module. When such a module (with multiple connections) has to be
replaced with another module, all the connections from the module has to be
redrawn in addition to replacing the module. The 'Store-Restore Link' feature
can be used to simplify the process of re-establishing the connections. Using
this feature, a user could store the collection of links originating from
specified pin and restore the connections on to an output pint on any other
modules in the signal flow.

Right click on the module and choose one of the output pins from "Store output
links" option to temporarily store all the links originating from that pin.
Select the module on to which the links are to be restored and use the option
"Re-store output links" from the context menu to restore the links. Choose the
output pin and the saved collection from the context menu. Links will be
validated before restoring. Invalid links in the collection (e.g. the
destination pin is consumed) will be skipped.
