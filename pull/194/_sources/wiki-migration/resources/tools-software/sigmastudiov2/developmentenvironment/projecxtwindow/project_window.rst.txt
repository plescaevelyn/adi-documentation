This Window displays the tree structure of the project in a hierarchical manner.
As depicted in the figure, starting from the system, the canvas of the system
has SC589 platform and USBi for communication and hence the PC, platform and the
usbi communication device are depicted as children of the system. Further the
SC589 platform has an SC5xx processor which consists of two SHARC cores and each
SHARC core has a schematic. The settings tab related to a particular platform,
processor, core or schematic can be opened from the project window.

This window is useful if we have to navigate to a particular element in the
schematic. Option for renaming the nodes is also available in the project
window. By selecting a particular node entry and pressing the rename button on
top of the window, allows the user to rename the node to a user desired name.

In cases where multiple platforms or processors are present in the project, the
user also has an option to specify the order in which the compilation of the ICs
has to take place. By using the up and down arrow marks present at the top, it
is possible to reorder the ICs in the desired way. Individual download of
platforms or processors in cases of multiple platforms/processors being present
is also possible. This can be achieved by selecting a particular
processor/platform and pressing on the download button present on top of the
window.
