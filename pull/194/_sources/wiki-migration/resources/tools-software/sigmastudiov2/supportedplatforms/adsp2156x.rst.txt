Processor Settings
------------------

-  **Build Mode (Release/Debug)** - This field is an input to the CCES compiler, indicating whether the code should be compiled in Debug or Release mode.
-  **Enable IPA** - Inter-procedural optimization can be enabled to reduce the MIPS consumption for a schematic. This will affect the time taken to compile and link the schematic.
-  **Input Buffers** - This field indicates the number of input buffers each of size “BlockSize” which the SigmaStudio+ Target Framework will use for input data buffering. By default, the number of Input buffers is set to 3. If a user enters a value which is more than the default value in SigmaStudio+ GUI, then the Audio control framework needs to be rebuilt.
-  **Output Buffers** - This field indicates the number of output buffers each of size “BlockSize” which the SigmaStudio+ Target Framework will use for output data buffering. By default, the number of Output buffers is set to 3. If a user enters a value which is more than the default value in SigmaStudio+ GUI, then the Audio control framework needs to be rebuilt
-  **CCES Version** - All the supported tool-chains which are installed on the PC are listed in this drop-down box. The user can select a tool-chain from this drop-down box for every Schematic. The latest installed version of CrossCore Embedded Studio is the default selection. The selected tool-chain is used by SigmaStudio+ to compile the Schematics and process the Plug-Ins.

Core Settings
-------------

-  **Process Mode** - This field indicates as to how the signal block instances are connected and processed on the SHARC+ core. This field is not applicable in case of a dual-core schematic. The following Process Modes are supported:

   -  Single
   -  Serial
   -  Parallel

-  **Schematics** - Number of instances of schematic on the core
-  **Application DXE** - The Application DXE can be loaded to the core using this ‘Open’ button. SigmaStudio+ uses the Application DXE to read the Global Memory map (GMAP). GMAP contains information corresponding to available physical memory for the core (remaining unused memory on a per block basis after consumption by the application)
