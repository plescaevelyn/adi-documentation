Description

The structure ADI_SS_CONFIG is used by the Application to configure the SS+.

Fields

• nBlockSize Size of the input sample block passed to the SS+ for processing. This is equal to the Application Block Size and is expressed in samples per channel.

• nInChannels Indicates the number of input audio buffer passed to the SS+.

• nOutChannels Indicates the number of output audio data received from the SS+.

• bSkipProcessOnCRCError Indicates whether to skip further processing of audio upon encountering a CRC or packet error. 1 indicates skip and 0 indicates continue audio processing.

• bSkipInitialDownload Set this to 1 if the code and parameters are not downloaded from the SigmaStudio Host through the communication channel. If this field is not set to ‘1’, the SS+ instance internally skips the process stage until the code and parameter are received through the communication channel.

• hSSComm Handle to SigmaStudio communication instance.

• nInitNoWait Flag indicating whether the adi_ss_Init() API needs to wait for the SS+ code and parameters to be received or not.

• bClearUnusedOutput Boolean flag indicating whether the unused output channels need to be cleared or not.
