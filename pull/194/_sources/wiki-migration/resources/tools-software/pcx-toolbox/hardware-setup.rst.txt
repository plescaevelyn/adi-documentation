Hardware Setup for Analog Devices Precision Toolbox
===================================================

For each of the converters supported by the Precision Toolbox, the hardware setup steps are outlined below. The steps detail the hardware and the configurations needed to get the Precision Toolbox to communicate with the converter evaluation board. ‎ ‎

AD4630-24, AD4630-16, AD4030-24
-------------------------------

You will require: SD-Card, Digilent Zedboard with 12 V wall-adapter power supply, PC running Windows 10.

-  Insert the SD card provided with the evaluation board into J12 on the ZedBoard
-  Connect the Evaluation board to the FMC connector of the ZedBoard.
-  Connect the provided power supplies to J20 on the ZedBoard.
-  Connect the USB cable to the USB OTG (J13) on the ZedBoard and to the computer
-  Connect the desired input signal to the appropriate input on the evaluation board (J2-J5)
-  Move SW8 to the ON position to start the ZedBoard

‎Refer to the :doc:`AD4630/AD4030 Evaluation Board User Guide </wiki-migration/resources/eval/ad4630-24-eval-board>` for more information.
