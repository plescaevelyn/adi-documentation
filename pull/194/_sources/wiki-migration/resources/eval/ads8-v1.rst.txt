ADS8-V1EBZ HIGH SPEED EVALUATION BOARD
======================================

Preface
-------

The :adi:`ADS8-V1 <en/content/CU_High-Speed_ADC_FIFO_evaluation_tools/fca.html#ADS8-V1>` Evaluation Board was developed to support the evaluation of Analog Devices High Speed Data Converters with JESD204B bit rates up to 16Gbps. This Wiki site provides a high level overview of the platform. In addition, each use-case of the board has its own section (e.g. Using the ADS8-V1 for High Speed A/D Converter Evaluation). The ADS8-V1 is intended to be used only with specified Analog Devices Evaluation Boards. The ADS8-V1 is not intended to be used as a general purpose development platform, and no support is available for standalone operation. The ADS8-V1 may contain hardware features not fully productized or supported by our default customer evaluation configurations. Please refer to Xilinx and its approved distributors for general purpose FPGA Development Kits.

Using the ADS8-V1EBZ to evaluate High Speed A/D Converters
==========================================================

Overview
--------

When connected to a specified Analog Devices high speed adc evaluation board,
the ADS8-V1 works as a data acquistion board. Designed to support the highest
speed JESD204B A/D Converters, the FPGA on the ADS8-V1 acts as the data
receiver, while the ADC is the data transmitter. A typical test setup is shown
below.
