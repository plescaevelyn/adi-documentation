Introduction
------------

The *ez*LINX*i*Coupler Isolated Interface Development Environment provides users with a convenient, cost-effective method of evaluating various isolated communication standards. This significantly reduces design and evaluation time for designers who are using Analog Devices isolated transceivers in their design. The*ez*LINX hardware platform contains an Analog Devices ADSP-BF548 processor which runs the open source uCLinux kernel and*ez*LINX embedded sample application. A Sample PC Application is also provided, which integrates with the*ez*\ LINX hardware platform via isolated USB, allowing for a complete plug and play evaluation and development experience with 8 isolated communication interfaces:

-  Isolated USB
-  Isolated CAN
-  Isolated RS-485/RS-422
-  Isolated RS-232
-  Isolated I2C
-  Isolated SPI
-  Isolated LVDS

The embedded software application is written in C and the Sample PC Application
is written in Microsoft Visual C# and uses version 4 of the Microsoft .NET
Framework. The Sample PC Application and embedded software have many features
when used together, including the following:

-  Simultaneous data transmission/reception on multiple isolated interfaces
-  User friendly software which can instantly switch between running interfaces
-  View data traffic during current session
-  Interfaces are readily customizable to suit your application
-  Embedded firmware is easily updated through isolated USB
-  Quickly save and load your entire configuration for all communication standards
-  Supports hardware routing of signals between interfaces

The open source nature of both the PC Application and the embedded software allow the user to view and edit the source code of the application to obtain the best use of the ezLINX hardware system for their application. The source code and Sample PC Application can be downloaded :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/eval/ezlinx>`.

Main Window

Upon starting the ezLINX Sample PC Application the Main System window is
displayed:

|image1|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure1: Main Window*\

From this window we see a complete overview of the ezLINX hardware system and
how it integrates with the ADSP-BF548 processor. The Sample PC Application is
designed to easily allow for the simultaneous use and evaluation of multiple
communication standards. The application has two sidebars at the left and the
right of the main window with seven active buttons allowing access to the
different transceiver interfaces. These interfaces can be accessed from any
window in the application. The color of these buttons indicates the status of
the transceiver, so:

- The **Light Gray** color: the transceiver is deactivated and disconnected.

- The **Steel Blue** color: the transceiver is activated and disconnected.

- The **Royal Blue** color: the transceiver is activated and connected.

The STATUS bar along the bottom of the window shows whether the application is
connected to an ezLINX hardware platform, the IP address of that hardware
platform, and the transceivers on the hardware which are currently enabled.
Clicking on the word STATUS opens the Transceiver Status Window, where you can
view the amount of data sent and received by each interface in the current
session. The Main Window of the application also has 3 buttons located under the
system block diagram:
