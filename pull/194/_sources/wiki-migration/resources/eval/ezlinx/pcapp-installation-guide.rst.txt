   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be **Recommended for New Designs** or in
   **Production**. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.

**Step 2:** Right click on *ezLINXPCApp.zip* and extract it.

**Step 3 (Windows XP Only):** If you already have v4 or higher of the .NET Framework or Windows Imaging Component already installed on your machine, skip this step. Windows Imaging Component is required to install and use the Microsoft .NET Framework. This can be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=32 (Figure 2 below). For the English installer the file *wic_x86_enu.exe* should be downloaded and ran. This will install Windows Imaging Component on your machine.

If you do not have the necessary software you will be prompted to accept the license agreement for the .NET Framework v4 and/or Windows Installer 3.1 (See Figure 4. below).
