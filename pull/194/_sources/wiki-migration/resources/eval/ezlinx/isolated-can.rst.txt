ezLINX™ Isolated CAN Implementation
===================================

The Isolated CAN port on the *ez*LINX Development Environment is implemented using the :adi:`ADM3053` Signal and Power Isolated CAN transceiver. The :adi:`ADM3053` connects to CAN0 of the ADSP-BF548 and is capable of functioning at data rates of up to 1Mbit/s. Figure 1 below is a circuit diagram of the implementation of the :adi:`ADM3053` on the*ez*\ LINX hardware.

The CAN Node can be configured using jumpers JP17 and JP18. When both jumpers JP17 and JP18 are fitted, the CAN node is split terminated with 120Ω and a common mode capacitor of 47nF. If termination is not required, remove JP17 and JP18. A list of jumper configurations for all the interfaces on *ez*\ LINX can be found :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/eval/ezlinx/config>`.

The 5V supply is connected to VCC (pin 8) to power the *iso*Power isolated Power supply of the :adi:`ADM3053`. This generates an isolated 5V on the Visoout pin (pin 12) of the ADM3053 and needs to is connected to the Visoin pin(pin 19). The 3.3V supply is connected to the VIO pin (pin 6) to power the*i*\ Coupler signal isolation, which needs to be compatible with the 3.3V logic of the Blackfin ADSP-BF548. The RS pin (pin 18) is connected through a 0Ω resistor to CAN_ISO_GND in order to de-activate slew rate limiting.

A four pin screw terminal connector, J8, is used for easy access to the CANH (Pin 1), CANL (Pin 3) and CAN_ISO_GND(Pin 2 and 4) connections. Application note :adi:`AN-1123 <static/imported-files/application_notes/AN-1123.pdf>` provides more information on implementing CAN Nodes.
