ezLINX™ Isolated I2C Implementation
===================================

The Isolated I2C port is implemented using the :adi:`ADuM1250` I2C Isolator and :adi:`ADuM5000` *iso*Power Isolated DC to DC converter. The :adi:`ADuM1250` connects to TW1 of the ADSP-BF548 and is capable of functioning at a maximum frequency of 1MHz. Figure 1 below shows a circuit diagram of the implementation of the :adi:`ADuM1250` and :adi:`ADuM5000` on the*ez*\ LINX hardware.

VDD1 of the :adi:`ADuM1250` and VDD1 of the :adi:`ADuM5000` are both powered by 3.3V. The ADuM5000 will generate an isolated 3.3V which is used to supply power to VDD2 of the :adi:`ADuM1250`.

A three pin screw terminal connector, J22, is used for easy access to the SDA
(Pin 1), SCL (Pin 2) and I2C_ISO_GND (Pin 3) connections.
