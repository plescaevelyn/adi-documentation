Evaluation Board for the ADR1001 Ultra Stable Buried Zener Voltage Reference in LCC-20
======================================================================================

Features
--------

Easy to Carry and Power Up "Pocket Calibrator" Style Edge mounted SMA connector Simple connection to test equipment and other circuits RoHS compliant

**EVALUATION KIT CONTENTS** ADR1001E-EBZ

**EQUIPMENT NEEDED** USB-C Compatible charger / power supply, or Benchtop Lab Supply Several Digit DMM (such as HP3458 or Keithley 2001) Two banana plug cables, or One SMA to meter-compatible cable

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION** The ADR1001E-EBZ allows the evaluation of the ADR1001AHZ, ultra-stable 6.6V Shunt Voltage Reference with Resistor Divider in LCC-20 package.

Isolated power means that the Reference output is effectively floated, removing the likelihood of ground loops. The isolation is bridged only by a 1Meg resistor. Power may be supplied via the USB-C cable, or 5V may be applied to “VUSB”, or power may be back driven onto the regulator outputs at “VPRE” or V+”. The ultra-stable 6.5V is divided down to a precision trimmed 5V which is brought out to both banana jacks and to an edge mounted SMA connector. .

EVALUATION BOARD QUICK START PROCEDURES

The following sections outline the basic prepopulated configuration of the ADR1399H-EBZ required to test the basic functionality of the device.

POWER SUPPLY CONSIDERATION Use a USB-C charger or other USB-C source to power the board. You should see a Green LED. Alternately, 5V can be applied between VUSB and DGND from a bench supply. This will power the isolating LMT8048 module, providing isolated power downstream. Alternately, the downstream regulators can be back driven at VPRE/AGND (Max 20V) or at V+/AGND (Max 16V). AGND is the Reference ground, so this approach is not isolated.

INITIAL BOARD CONFIGURATION The ADR1001E-EBZ comes pre-configured. There are no jumpers or other settings. Just power the board using (only) one of the methods described above, and begin watching the 5V output at either the SMA output or the Banana jacks (or both). For the best investigation, you will need a 6-digit or higher meter, such as HP3458 or Keithley 2001/2 or equivalent.

When the board is powered, a green and a red LED should illuminate. When the chip reaches temperature, the red LED should turn off.

USING THE EVALUATION BOARD FOR TESTING The board was designed along the lines of a simple “pocket calibrator”, so alternate means of supplying the DUT were not thoroughly provided for. For example, the Heater- is directly grounded, so there is no means of providing a negative 15V supply to Heater- for an overall 30V heater supply.

The board is very easy to use. Just power the board using one of the methods discussed, and start measuring the output DC voltage. If you measure the supply current, you should see an initial fairly high current as the heater brings the ADR1001 to temperature (approx. 70C). The ADR1001 has an internal current limit of about 100mA, but the on board LT3045’s have been configured to limit available current to 75mA. After losses and transformer, this limits the 5V USB input current to about 250mA.

The TSET pin is brought out to resistors R14 and R15 to allow for adjustment of the chip temperature. The INV1 and INV2 pins are brought out to TP7 and TP8 allowing access to the on-chip matched resistor pair, but no simple means of using them in circuit has been provided, as we sought to optimize the 5V reference and not introduce more thermocouples.
