   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be **Recommended for New Designs** or in
   **Production**. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.



ezLINX™ iCoupler® Isolated Interface Development Environment
============================================================

The *ez*LINX*i*Coupler Isolated Interface Development environment provides developers with a cost-effective, plug and play solution for evaluating eight physical Layer, digitally-isolated communication standards(USB, RS-422, RS-485, RS-232, CAN, SPI, I2C and LVDS). The Blackfin ADSP-BF548 processor is used to run the uCLinux operating system and allows for easy customization through the open source hardware and software platform. Development time is significantly reduced for embedded designers and system architects who are designing and evaluating isolated communication standards.The Interfaces on*ez*LINX use ADI's isolated transceivers with integrated*i*Coupler and*iso*\ Power® digital isolator technology.

Kernel Update Guide
-------------------

| The ezLINX board allows for the embedded kernel of the Blackfin® Processor to be updated with the latest version of the kernel image file. This will improve the functionality and reliability of the board.
| For the step-by-step kernel update guide and the latest image file, follow the link below:
| :doc:`Kernel Update Guide </wiki-migration/resources/eval/ezlinx/kernel_update>`

Kernel Restore Guide
--------------------

| If the kernel image file becomes corrupted then the ezLINX board cannot be connected to the PC application. In this case the factory reset feature can't be used and in order to re-establish the connection the kernel must be restored from the back-up location in the ezLINX board's flash memory. This process can also be used to revert the embedded software on the ezLINX board back to its original version.
| For the step-by-step kernel restore guide, follow the link below:
