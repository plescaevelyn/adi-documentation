EVAL-ADVTS4152-EBZ Overview
===========================

The :adi:`EVAL-ADVTS4152` demonstration board is intended for systems that require a constant output voltage of 5V like in a Vehicle tracking system (VTS). It is run by a main battery source with a back-up battery in case of unwanted shortage of supply happens in the input. Demo board features the three main parts that function as one to achieve the highest performance and reliability of the board. These parts are:

:adi:`LT4356-1`: a surge stopper that protects high voltage transients such as load dumps to electronic automotive loads, with wide range input capability of 4V to 80V and clamps to a desirable voltage output that suites will suite your design need. It also provides protection against reverse input and cold crank.

:adi:`LT8609A <LT8609>`: a compact, high efficiency and high speed synchronous monolithic step-down switching regulator that outputs desired max current of 3A continuously.

And, :adi:`LTC4040`: supply rail and backup battery that contains high current step-up DC/DC regulator that backup the supply from a single cell Li-Ion or LiFePO4 and help power the system when the main supply cuts off. The demo board has an EMI filter installed for automotive standard requirement and optional ADT6401 circuit for over temp protection if the design needs to protect abnormal high DC Input.

EVAL-ADVTS4152-EBZ is a board that can easily be integrated and can speed up faster time to market.

:adi:`EVAL-ADVTS4152-EBZ <EVAL-ADVTS4152>` is consist of three major sections. These are the Fault Protection and Surge Stopper, Step-Down Regulator, Back-Up Supply. These three blocks work together to provide reliable and efficient power to the downstream electronics like VTS. It can operate across a wide range of input voltage of 80V DC and surge voltage of up to 210V.

Section 1: This section functions as a Fault Protection that is mainly driven by the LT4356-1 IC. This IC protects the board from surge and overvoltage, this keeps the system work in a desired operating voltage range. When a surge event occurs, the LT4356-1 clamps the voltage at 38V allowing the board to maintain its operation at a certain time standard for automotive while the surge.

Section 2: This section function as step-down regulator in the board and is mainly catered by the LT8609A IC – a highly efficiency and high speed synchronous monolithic step-down switching regulator which keeps the output level at a constant voltage of 5V a max current of 3A.The LT8609A burst mode operation enables high efficiency down to very low output current while keeping the output ripple below 10mVpeak-peak.

LT8609A has a SYNC pin that allows synchronization to an external clock or spread spectrum modulation for low EMI operation.

Section 3: This section function as a back-up supply or battery back-up power manager in the board. Mainly catered by the LTC4040 IC – a high-current step-up DC-to-DC regulator to back up the supply from a single-cell Lithium Ion or Lithium-Iron-Phosphate battery.

When the main input supply is available, the LTC4040 chip step-up regulator operates in reverse as a step-down battery charger to the Li-Ion or LiFePO4. The charging voltage can be configured via selectable pin S3, S2 and S1. Check the performance summary table for reference.

==============================================

ADVTS-4152 Combo Power Supply Typical Operation Set-up

The ADVTS-4152 board is typically installed between car battery supply and downstream load. The back-up battery is then attached to the VBACKUP pin to complete the system. The board when applied with 12V or 24 V DC supply coming from car battery then outputs a constant of 5V DC with 3A max current. Once the ADVTS-4152 Combo Power supply board is connected, it is now a good to go in your system.
