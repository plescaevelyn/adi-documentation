General Description
===================

The :adi:`AD9578` evaluation board is a compact, easy-to-use platform for evaluating all features of the :adi:`AD9578`. The :adi:`AD9578` is a programmable synthesizer intended for jitter attenuation and asynchronous clocking applications in high performance telecommunications, networking, data storage, serializer/deserializer (SERDES) and physical layer (PHY) applications. The evaluation board consists of one prepopulated 49.152MHz crystal and optional single ended SMA inputs to drive the XO2 and XO4 pins. Each output is accessed through edge launch ac-coupled SMA connectors. The on board power supply allows users to simply operate the :adi:`AD9578` with 2.5V or 3.3V voltages by altering a few jumper settings. Use this user guide in conjunction with the :adi:`AD9578` data sheet and the evaluation software available at :adi:`EVAL-AD9578.html#eb-overview <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9578.html#eb-overview>`.

Evaluation Board Hardware
=========================


The following instructions are for setting up the physical connections to the AD9578/PCBZ evaluation board.

Power Connections
-----------------

The AD9578/PCBZ is setup by default to power the AD9578 and remaining circuitry with 3.3V using the provided 6V wall power supply. The evaluation board can be configured to operate at 2.5V when using the 6V wall supply by removing jumpers P507 and P509. Make sure the jumper P508 is between pins 1 and 2.

Connecting External Supplies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An external power source may be connected to both the AD9578 and digital circuitry by using header P506. The AD9578 and digital circuitry must operate at the same voltage level for proper functionality. To connect an external supply:

-  Remove jumpers P502 and P510 and disconnect the 6V wall supply.
-  Connect either 2.5V or 3.3V to pins 1,2,5,6 of the P506 header. Pins 3 and 4 are a shared universal ground for both power planes.

PC Connections
--------------

The following instructions assume the evaluation board is set up with the default power configuration as described in the **Power Connections** section.

-  Download the latest :adi:`AD9578 evaluation software <EVAL-AD9578>` from AD9578/PCBZ website.
-  Install the :adi:`AD9578 evaluation software <EVAL-AD9578>`; uninstall prior versions of the software before installation updates. Administrative privileges are needed to install the software.
-  Connect the 6V wall power supply to the main power connector labeled P500.
-  Connect the USB cables to the evaluation board and the computer. The red LED labeled CR300 on the evaluation board should illuminate.
-  If the **Found New Hardware Wizard** window automatically appears when the evaluation board is connected, select **Install the software automatically** and click **Next**.

   -  The **Found New Hardware Wizard** window may appear twice, and a system restart may be required.

Refer to the Evaluation Board Software section for details on running the AD9578 evaluation board software.

Signal Connections
------------------

XO Inputs
~~~~~~~~~

The AD9578 evaluation board comes prepopulated with a 49.152MHz crystal (Y101) across the XO1 and XO2 pins. Crystal Y102 connects to the XO3 and XO4 pins and is not prepopulated. Any crystal between 22MHz and 54MHz in a 3.2mm x 2.5mm package is suitable but care must be taken to select the proper load capacitance to ensure oscillation.

Outputs
~~~~~~~

The REFOUT output (J217 and J218) can be configured to be a copy of either XO input or a divided version of the applied REFCLK input (includes divide by 1). The frequency source of OUT1 and OUT2 is PLL1 and the source of OUT3 and OUT4 is PLL2. The logic level of each output is selectable between CMOS, HCSL, LVDS and LVPECL. All outputs are terminated as 3.3V LVPECL by default and ac coupled to their respective SMA connectors. Using any logic type other than LVPECL will require modifications to the terminations. Refer to the AD9578 datasheet for the recommended termination for each logic type.

SPI Bus
~~~~~~~

The AD9574/PCBZ default configuration allows a PC running the AD9578 evaluation software to read and write the various registers of the AD9578 via a USB connection. The user may interface with the SPI bus from an external SPI controller by removing jumpers P107-P110 and driving the appropriate signals to the SDO, SCK, CSB, and SDI nodes at the pin 2 of the P107-P110. As GND, use TP102 point.

Default Evaluation Boards Setup Summary
---------------------------------------

-  Jumper P508 set to SW_OUT between pins 1 and 2 to provide the switcher output voltage to the on board LDO regulators.
-  Jumpers P507 and P509 are populated to set LDO regulator outputs to 3.3V.
-  Jumpers P502 and P510 are populated to connect LDO voltages to the AD9578 and the microcontroller.
-  49.152MHz crystal oscillator connected to the XO1 and XO2 inputs is populated.
-  OUT1 (J209 and J210), OUT2 (J211 and J212), OUT3 (J213 and J214), OUT4 (J215 and J216), and REFOUT (J217 and J218) are terminated for 3.3V LVPECL and ac coupled.

Evaluation Board Software
=========================


Use the following instructions to set up the :adi:`AD9578` evaluation board software.

Software Installation
---------------------

Connect the evaluation board to the PC until the software installation is complete.

~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9578 software allows the user to save a setup file containing all of the current register settings generated by the software, which can be later read, and re used.

To create a setup file:

-  Open the AD9578 software with or without an evaluation board present.
-  Adjust the AD9578 settings within the GUI.
-  Select **File/Save All Registers** and enter a file name and file path where the register settings to be saved.

To load a setup file:

-  Select **File/Load All Registers**. The setup file will automatically be loaded into the evaluation board active settings and displayed in the Main Window.

Quick Start Guide
=================


Once the evaluation software is loaded and the evaluation board is connected, use the following steps to lock both PLLs on the AD9578. These steps use the on board 49.152MHz crystal as a reference for both PLL1 and PLL2 and the default power configuration using the provided 6V wall supply as described in the **Evaluation Board Hardware** section. The quick start guide covers only simple PLL operation. See the AD9578 datasheet and **Evaluation Software Components** section for a detailed explanation of the various AD9578 features. The following case is an example of the AD9578 using the values in **Table 1**.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image6| *Figure 6. AD9578 Evaluation Software Main Window*


Active and Inactive Controls
----------------------------

Upon startup, many controls in the AD9578 main window are inactive and grayed out. To manipulate all controls within the main window check the **Advanced** box in the lower right corner of the main window.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image7| *Figure 7. Advanced Box*


Checking the **Advanced** box expands the main window to include a full register map and many other features, which are explained in the following sections of the user guide.

Invalid Value Indication
------------------------

Certain combinations of values can cause the AD9578 operating parameters to exceed the valid ranges specified in the datasheet. In these cases, the invalid entry will be highlighted in yellow and a message will appear in the **Comments** box explaining why the entry is invalid.

The following conditions are checked within the software:

-  Crystal 1, Crystal 2, and External Reference input frequency ranges
-  Output 1 through Output 4 and Reference Output frequency ranges.
-  All text box entries within the expanded Main Window when the **Advanced** box is checked.

Autocalculate, Configure, and Read Buttons
------------------------------------------

| The **Autocalculate** button takes the user defined reference input and output frequency parameters and automatically configures the proper PLL settings using the Frequency Wizard. Autocalculate is disabled in **Advanced Controls** mode. For more information on the **Frequency Wizard** and **Advanced Controls**, refer to the respective sections in this document.
| The **Configure** button loads all of the parameters from the GUI into the AD9578 on the evaluation board. **“Write All Successful”** will appear in the comments box upon the completion of a successful write operation.
| The **Read** button reads the current register values from inside the AD9578 and loads them into the Main Window. **“Read All Successful”** will appear in the comments box upon the completion of a successful read operation.

Input Frequency Section
-----------------------

The input frequency section of the Main Window is used to identify the reference input frequency of either crystal input. Each text box (**Crystal 1** and **Crystal 2**) is editable by the user and is used to calculate the output frequency of each output. If a differential input is used for an external reference, check the **Differential Input** check box.

PLL Input Reference Selection
-----------------------------

The reference input to each PLL is specified by using the various drop down menus shown in Figure 8.

.. container:: centeralign


   ..

|image8|

   *Figure 8. PLL Input Reference Selection Drop Downs*


Each PLL and REFOUT reference frequency can be supplied by Crystal 1, Crystal 2, or an external reference input Ref In. Crystal 2 and Ref In cannot be used simultaneously. The selection of Ref In or Crystal 2 is controlled by using the Ref In/Crystal 2 drop down.

PLL1 and PLL2 Default Controls
------------------------------

The AD9578 evaluation software automatically configures the settings for each PLL based on user inputs for both the reference frequency and output frequency by using an internal frequency wizard and the **Autocalculate** button. To enable an output text box, change the appropriate logic level in each outputs allocated drop down menu. Logic levels are selectable from LVDS, LVPECL, HCSL, and LVCMOS. Once a text box is enabled, the user may enter the desired output frequency. Pressing **Autocalculate** will then calculate the value closest to the user input. Figure 9 shows a standard configuration in the software’s default mode using Output 1 and Output 3.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image9| *Figure 9. PLL1 and PLL2 Default Controls*


The **OEx** and **override** check boxes allow the user to manipulate the various output enable bits from the register 0x02 of the AD9578. Default operation is for both boxes to be checked, allowing the software to have control over each output.

PLL1 and PLL2 Advanced Controls
-------------------------------

Clicking the Advanced check box, as shown in Figure 7, expands the Main Window to allow the user to interact with individual PLL settings and the entire register map as the part is currently configured.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image10| //Figure 10. PLL1 and PLL2 Advanced Controls *


In **Advanced Controls** mode, all PLL feedback dividers, output dividers, charge pump and VCO settings are editable by typing in the various text boxes. It is recommended to allow the software to auto select the VCO band being used when in **Advanced Controls** mode. In this mode, all of the output frequencies are calculated based off the user’s settings for the reference frequencies and feedback/output division settings. The **Autocalcuate** feature is thus disabled in **Advanced Controls** mode. Another feature in **Advanced Controls** mode is the **Reset Fuses Button**\ *. This button allows the user to reset the AD9578 to its default fuse blown settings without power cycling evaluation board. The default fuse blown settings are then displayed in the Main Window.

.. container:: centeralign

   *Figure 11. Reset Fuses Button*

Reference Output Section
------------------------

The Reference Output source is selected in the **Input Frequency Section**. The output frequency is displayed in the **Reference Output** section and the logic level is selectable from LVDS, LVPECL, HCSL, and LVCMOS.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image11| *Figure 12. Reference Output Section*


PLL Lock Indicators
-------------------

When either PLL1 or PLL2 are in lock, the appropriate PLL lock indicator will turn blue.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image12| *Figure 13. PLL Lock Indicators*


Comments Box

The Comments box displays notifications to the user upon successful read/write operations as well as warnings when maximum limits of the part have been exceeded. Pressing the **Clear Comments** button erases all previous comments.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image13| *Figure 14. Comments Box*


Frequency Wizard
----------------

The AD9578 **Frequency Wizard** is responsible for calculating the optimum PLL settings for the user’s desired input and output frequencies when the **Autocalculate** feature is used. For any given frequency plan there may be multiple configurations possible for each PLL. The Frequency Wizard will automatically pick the best option by default, but every configuration can be accessed by pressing the **Show Frequency Wizard** button after **Autocalculate** has been pressed. The **Frequency Wizard** is shown in Figure 15.

.. container:: centeralign
