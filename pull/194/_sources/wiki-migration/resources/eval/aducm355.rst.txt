ADuCM355 Reference Design User Guide.
=====================================

Introduction
============

The ADuCM355 reference design is a gas sensing platform which allows a user to
build a flexible gas sensing measurement and evaluation system showcasing the
ADuCM355. This as a reference design to showcase the ADuCM355 but is not aimed
to be an off-the-shelf product.

The reference design provides a modular plug in approach enabling gas
measurements from EC (Electrochemical) based sensors supplied by a 3rd party,
along with support for the most common PM sensors on the market. It is
compatible with most 4-series EC sensors on the market. The system allows for up
to four EC sensors to be connected at one time. This is to mimic a typical gas
sensing instrument, where CO, H2S, O2, LEL gases are monitored.It is also
applicable for Outdoor Air Quality measurement, by using a different suite (CO,
O3, SO2, NO2) of 4-series sensors. The measurements are sent to a PC GUI via USB
cable, where they are displayed on a GUI.

Hardware
========

The hardware is broken into modules. The motherboard consists of 4 connectors to
connect up to sensor daughterboards. It has the ADuCM3029 Cortex M3 acting as
the host MCU. It's function is to communicate with the sensors, and send the
collected data to a PC GUI.

There are two different daughterboard designs. Each plugs into the motherboard.
Up to 4 daughter boards can be connected at once. The Gas Sensor daughterboard
consists of an ADuCM355 and socket for almost any 2,3 or 4 lead 4-series
sensors. The Water Sensor daughterboard consists of an ADuCM355 and BNC socket
for off-the-shelf pH probes and sondes.

Outdoor Air Quality Reference Design
====================================

The system supports the four main EPA gases

Expansion and further evaluation
================================

The kit consists of the motherboard and one sensor daughterboard. More
daughterboards can be ordered separately.

An emulator board is available. It can be ordered separately. It allows the user
to re-program both the ADuCM355 daughter board and the ADuCM3029 host MCU on the
motherboard. This is recommended for deeper development activity, after initial
evaluation of the basic reference design system.

Water Quality Reference Design
==============================

The system can also be used to evaluate the ADuCM355 for Water Quality Analysis
applications. The same motherboard is used, but the daughterboard used is the
water quality daughterboard. This is optimized for use with standard water
quality probes such as pH probes, and includes a BNC connector for easy setup.
