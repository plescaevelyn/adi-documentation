6G FR3 Reference Design for Wireless Test
=========================================

The need for ubiquitous connectivity, high speed data, wide bandwidth streaming
is driving newer wireless technologies like 6G, Wi-Fi 7 & 8 and UWB. As these
newer standards emerge, the testing complexity is also increasing such as wider
bandwidths, higher frequencies, complex modulations, higher dynamic range.
Instrumentation customers are seeking solutions that tame their measurement
challenges, shorten their development times, and provide the highest
performance.

ADI’s 6G FR3 Radio Front End (RFFE) reference design aims to address these
challenges for Test and Measurement customers. It supports frequencies from
6-18GHz and instantaneous bandwidths up to 4GHz. The FR3 RFFE includes TX and RX
modes for signal generation and spectrum analysis applications respectively.
Each TX & RX path have a dedicated LO inputs to support TDD and FDD operation.

The FR3 reference design uses ADI’s latest RF signal conditioning solutions such
as the HMC8191 IQ Mixer, ADMV8818 Tunable Filter, wideband distributed driver
amplifiers along with RF switching and attenuation. The design also includes
other critical functions of clocking and power management to simply customer
implementation.

The RFFE is agnostic to the data converter used; however, it is recommended to
use ADI’s MxFE data converter solutions. The measurements shown in the ensuing
section uses the Apollo MxFE ADC and DAC.

6-18 GHz RF Front-End Design includes complete TX and RX signal chains with 4
GHz of iBW. The design supports both 5G/6G signal generation and spectrum
analyzer/demodulator. I/Q IF ports are provided for TX inputs and RX outputs,
there's a common RF input/output interface connector. both TX and RX each have
dedicated LO inputs to support FDD or TDD operation.
