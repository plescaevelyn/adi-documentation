AD-FMCOMMS8-EBZ
===============

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS8-EBZ <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ad-fmcomms8-ebz.html>` is an integrated RF design containing two Analog Devices :adi:`ADRV9009` wideband transceivers. By connecting to a compatible FPGA development board that supports FMC HPC mechanical connector and JESD204B bus interface it can be used for evaluation and prototyping with upto 4 Transmit and Receive channels that can be synchronised in phase and frequency. Additionally it can be used with the ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM system. This gives a path to evaluating and prototyping with upto 8 phase and frequency synchronised Transmit and Receive channels for complex multi-stream applications ensuring end-to-end deterministic latency.

The ADRV9009 Transceivers include integrated LO and phase synchronization. Overall system frequency & phase synchronization is maintained with a clock tree structure using ADI high performance low jitter :adi:`HMC7044` device, making it ideal for applications requiring RF phase alignment with a large number of channels.
