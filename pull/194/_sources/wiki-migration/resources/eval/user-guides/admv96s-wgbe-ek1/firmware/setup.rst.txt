ADMV96S-WGBE-EK1 Firmware User Guide
====================================

Evaluation
----------

The evaluation kit comes with the :adi:`MAX32650 <en/products/max32650.html>` preprogrammed with a firmware that is ready to use as-is. If you've gone through the :doc:`hardware setup </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/admv96s-wgbe-ek1/hardware>` and you've connected at least the power and the Ethernet cables to the two boards of the setup, the firmware takes care of establishing and maintaining a wireless link automatically on power on.

How to find the firmware version?
---------------------------------

Boot message
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a board is powered up or reset with the RESET button, the firmware starts executing and prints some messages over the serial port. You may access the serial port by connecting a MAXDAP to the JTAG SWD header and to the PC. To view the boot messages, open up a serial terminal application of your choice and configure it to listen to the serial port that appears in your system when you connect the MAXDAP to the PC (COMx on Windows, /dev/ttyACMx on Linux). The serial port settings must be 115200 baud, 8 databits, no parity bits, 1 stopbit, no flow control signals.

A typical boot message looks like this:

::

   tags/wethlink-v1.0.0-7c98c2261 for revision B
   Transceiver: admv9625
   EEPROM: loading non-volatile parameters...
   EEPROM: loaded non-volatile parameters.
   Running IIOD server...
   If successful, you may connect an IIO client application by:
   1. Disconnecting the serial terminal you use to view this message.
   2. Connecting the IIO client application using the serial backend configured as shown:
       Baudrate: 345600
       Data size: 8 bits
       Parity: none
       Stop bits: 1
       Flow control: none

The firmware version is thus ``v1.0.0``, built using git commit ``7c98c2261`` for ``revision B`` hardware.

Using libiio from command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``libiio (v0.25 or later)`` library setup also installs some useful command line tools such as ``iio_info`` which can connect to a remote ``iiod`` applciation and display information about it. In our case, the firmware is running an ``iiod`` application, as can be seen in the boot message, so we can query it over the serial port (replace /dev/ttyACM0 with COMn on Windows):

::

   $ iio_info -u serial:/dev/ttyACM0,345600,8n1n
   iio_info version: 0.25 (git tag:v0.25)
   Libiio version: 0.25 (git tag: v0.25) backends: local xml ip usb serial
   IIO context created with serial backend.
   Backend version: 1.1 (git tag: 0000000)
   Backend description string: no-OS/projects/wethlink tags/wethlink-v1.0.0-7c98c2261
   ...

We can conclude that the on-board firmware is ``v1.0.0`` built using git commit ``7c98c2261``.

Using Wethlink GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply connect to the serial port of the device with the Wethlink GUI app and observe the Context tab content.

How to update the firmware ?
----------------------------

Drag and drop a .hex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update to a newer firmware version (`such as the latest release <https://swdownloads.analog.com/update/wethlink/latest/revb-wethlink.hex>`_), download the .hex file onto the DAPLINK drive that is created when you plug in the programmer. While the file is being copied, you will see the MAXDAP device blinking. Once the programming is done, the device reconnects again to the PC as a DAPLINK drive. Check this newly attached DAPLINK drive for a FAIL.TXT file. If it doesn't exist, you have correctly programmed the board as in the following video:

`fw-update.webm <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/admv96s-wgbe-ek1/fw-update.webm>`_

If however, there is a FAIL.TXT file, if might be that the programmer isn't connected correctly or that the firmware of the programmer itself is not a firmware that can program a :adi:`MAX32650 <en/products/max32650.html>` target. Here's how a failed programming looks like:

`fw-update-bad.webm <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/admv96s-wgbe-ek1/fw-update-bad.webm>`_



.. collapsible:: Is the MAXDAP firmware correct?

   The MAXDAP itself needs to run a specific firmware version to be able to program the MAX32650 with Drag and Drop. The DETAILS.TXT file on the DAPLINK drive specifies the Git SHA of the running firmware:

   ::

      Git SHA: 649f2a1524190c5f0ea32c97bb8682ad6fd772a0

   If what you see on your device is not the one indicated above, please follow the :git-max32625pico-firmware-images:`instructions on this page <max32625pico-firmware-images>` to update the MAXDAP firmware first.



mcufla.sh
~~~~~~~~~

:git-no-OS:`no-OS` provides a standalone script that can be used to program .elf files to various targets, including the :adi:`MAX32650 <en/products/max32650.html>`. Typical usage and output is shown below:

::

make run
~~~~~~~~

This method involves installing the toolchain for building the ``projects/wethlink`` project and uploading the generated binary to the target with ``make run``.

Hardware revision must be specified when building the wethlink project, otherwise the build errors out. ``make HW_VERSION=0`` builds for rev A hardware, and ``make HW_VERSION=1`` builds for rev B hardware.


No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive :git-no-OS:`no-OS`

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects:

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

-  It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
-  You must have all updates installed in WSL.

::

        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

-  You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
-  You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers:

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

-  Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

-  To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

-  If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive :git-no-OS:`no-OS`

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects: 

.. collapsible:: Linux (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Make sure the GNU Make version you are using is >= 4.2.

      -  Install `stm32cubeide <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html>`_ (latest version) to default location ``/opt/stm32cubeide``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEIDE=/path/to/your/stm32cubeide`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install `stm32cubemx <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html>`_ version 6.5.0 to default location ``/opt/stm32cubemx``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEMX=/path/to/your/stm32cubemx`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install python (if not already present) and make sure python command executes Python3 (not Python2). This can be easily achieved by running the following command ``sudo apt install python-is-python3``.





   .. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

      -  Install the `Maxim Micros SDK <https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/software-description.html/swpart=SFW0018720A>`_.

         Make sure that the virtual environment is activated (environment name enclosed in parenthesis appears in the git terminal) and that the packages from prerequisites were installed.


      To build a project, type:

      ::

         make PLATFORM=mbed TARGET_BOARD=...

      The ``TARGET_BOARD`` specifies the board for which the project is built. If not specified, it defaults to ``SDP-K1``.

   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      Assuming you've installed STM32CubeMX at C:\\stm32cubemx and STM32CubeIDE to C:\\stm32cubeide, run these commands prior to building to let the build system know where they are installed:

      ::

         $ export STM32CUBEMX=/c/stm32cubemx
         $ export STM32CUBEIDE=/c/stm32cubeide

      Make sure you have the .ioc file in the project directory, then type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=stm32

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.



The build process creates a **build** directory in the project folder:

::

   build
   ├── app
   ├── bsp
   ├── obj
   ├── project_name.elf
   └── tmp

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

-  It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
-  You must have all updates installed in WSL.

::

        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

-  You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
-  You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers:

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

-  Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

-  To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

-  If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive :git-no-OS:`no-OS`

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects: 

.. collapsible:: Linux (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Make sure the GNU Make version you are using is >= 4.2.

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.



The build process creates a **build** directory in the project folder:

::

   build
   ├── app
   ├── bsp
   ├── obj
   ├── project_name.elf
   └── tmp

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

-  It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
-  You must have all updates installed in WSL.

::

        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

-  You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
-  You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers:

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

-  Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

-  To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

-  If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

++++ Debugging with Vitis 2025.1 (Unified IDE) \|

.. important::

   Starting with Vitis 2023.2, Xilinx transitioned from Eclipse to a Unified IDE architecture. **Vitis 2025.1 now features automatic debug configuration** - no manual setup required!


**Key Changes in Vitis 2025.1:**

-  Debug configuration **automatically generated** by build system
-  Bitstream and initialization files **auto-extracted** from XSA
-  Architecture-specific settings **auto-configured** (ZynqMP, Zynq, MicroBlaze, Versal)
-  Just click **FLOW → Debug** to start debugging!

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Vitis 2025.1 installed
-  Hardware design file (.xsa) in project directory
-  JTAG and UART cables connected to target board

WSL2 Users: One-Time xsdb Fix
-----------------------------

.. important::

   On WSL2, xsdb crashes with "Segmentation fault" due to rlwrap incompatibility. Apply this fix once per machine.


**If you've already applied this fix previously, skip this step.**

**Automated Installation (Recommended):**

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh

**Manual Installation:**

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS

   # Backup original
   sudo cp /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb.original

   # Install fixed version
   sudo cp tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/xsdb-nowrap /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb
   sudo chmod +x /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb

**Note:** This is a system-wide fix, only needs to be done once per machine.

Per-Project Setup (First Time Only)
-----------------------------------

Step 1: Build Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   For optimal debugging, always build with ``DEBUG=1``. This enables proper debug symbols and correct source path mapping.


::

   source /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/settings64.sh
   cd /path/to/no-OS/projects/your_project
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

**What happens:**

-  Build runs with debug optimization (``‑O0``, no optimization)
-  Full debug symbols added (``‑g3``)
-  Source path mapping configured (``‑fdebug‑prefix‑map``)
-  First build automatically runs ``make project`` (generates BSP and FSBL)
-  Creates ``build/your_project.elf`` with debug symbols

.. tip::

   **Without DEBUG=1**, you'll experience:

   
   -  Code stepping doesn't work properly (optimized code)
   -  Variables optimized out and not visible
   -  Breakpoints may not hit expected lines
   


Step 2: Open Vitis IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   make sdkopen

**First time only:** When Vitis opens, you'll see "Update Workspace" dialog:

-  Message: "Vitis IDE cannot recognize the workspace version. Click 'Update' to initialize the workspace metadata."
-  Click **"Update"** button
-  This initializes the workspace (one-time setup)

**What happens automatically:**

-  Vitis opens at project root
-  Workspace metadata initialized
-  ``_ide/`` directory created
-  **Bitstream extracted** from XSA to ``_ide/system_top/system_top.bit``
-  **Initialization script extracted** (``psu_init.tcl`` or ``ps_init.tcl``)
-  **Debug configuration generated** (``_ide/launch.json``) with:

   -  Correct architecture settings (ZynqMP/Zynq/MicroBlaze/Versal)
   -  Hardware platform path (XSA file)
   -  FSBL configuration (if applicable)
   -  Application ELF path
   -  Target processor

.. note::

   **No manual configuration needed!** The debug configuration is ready to use immediately.


Step 3: Verify Configuration (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to verify or customize the auto-generated configuration:

-  In Vitis Explorer, expand ``_ide`` folder
-  Open ``launch.json`` to view the configuration
-  Configuration named ``<project_name>_app_hw_1`` is ready to use

The configuration is automatically regenerated each time you run ``make sdkopen``.

Debugging Your Project
----------------------

Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect JTAG cable to your board
-  Connect UART cable (for console output)
-  Power on the board

Start Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In Vitis IDE:**

-  Make sure you've built with ``make DEBUG=1``
-  Click **FLOW** panel (left side) → Click **"Debug"**
-  Debug session starts immediately!

.. warning::

   The **Start Debugging (F5)** button in the Debug panel does not currently work for Vitis 2025.1. Always use **FLOW → Debug** button.


**What happens:**

-  Vitis connects to board via JTAG
-  Programs FPGA with bitstream
-  Runs FSBL to initialize processor (ZynqMP/Zynq only)
-  Loads your application ELF
-  Stops at entry point - ready to debug!

**Debug Features:**

-  Set breakpoints (click left margin in code)
-  Step through code (F5=Step Into, F6=Step Over, F7=Step Return, F8=Resume)
-  Inspect variables, registers, call stack
-  Watch expressions
-  View memory and disassembly

Daily Development Workflow
--------------------------

After initial setup:

::

   # 1. Edit code

   # 2. Build with debug symbols
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

   # 3. Open Vitis and debug
   make sdkopen
   # Click FLOW → Debug → Debugging starts immediately!

.. tip::

   For production builds (no debugging), use ``make`` without ``DEBUG=1`` to get optimized code.


Architecture-Specific Notes
---------------------------

The build system automatically detects your hardware architecture and configures debug settings appropriately.

**ZynqMP (Cortex-A53/R5):**

-  Processor: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` or ``psu_cortexr5_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-zu``
-  FSBL Required: Yes (auto-configured)
-  Init Script: ``psu_init.tcl``

**Zynq-7000 (Cortex-A9):**

-  Processor: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-zynq``
-  FSBL Required: Yes (auto-configured)
-  Init Script: ``ps_init.tcl``

**MicroBlaze:**

-  Processor: ``microblaze_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-mb``
-  FSBL Required: No (auto-configured)

**Versal (Cortex-A72):**

-  Processor: ``psv_cortexa72_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-versal``
-  Uses PLM (Platform Loader Manager) instead of FSBL (auto-configured)

Troubleshooting
---------------

**"Segmentation fault" when debugging:**

-  Solution: Install xsdb WSL2 fix (see above)

**Debug doesn't start / "undefined" connection errors:**

-  Make sure you clicked "Update" on first workspace open
-  Verify ``_ide/launch.json`` exists
-  Try ``make sdkopen`` again to regenerate configuration

**Stepping doesn't work / variables optimized out:**

++++ Debugging with Vitis 2023.2-2024.x (Classic Eclipse IDE) \|

.. important::

   The ``make sdkopen`` command automatically detects Vitis 2023.2-2024.x and launches the **Classic Eclipse IDE** (using the ``-classic`` flag) instead of the Unified IDE. This provides better stability and complete debug configuration support for makefile-based projects.


.. warning::

   **Manual debug configuration required** for Classic Eclipse mode. For automatic configuration, upgrade to Vitis 2025.1+.


**Why Classic Mode for Vitis 2023.2-2024.x?**

-  Vitis 2023.2 introduced the Unified IDE, but the User Managed Mode (required for makefile-based projects) has incomplete debug configuration support
-  The classic Eclipse mode provides a mature, fully-functional debugging experience

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Vitis 2023.2, 2023.2, 2024.1, or 2024.2 installed
-  Hardware design file (.xsa) in project directory
-  JTAG and UART cables connected to target board

WSL2 Users: One-Time xsdb Fix
-----------------------------

.. important::

   On WSL2, xsdb crashes with "Segmentation fault" due to rlwrap incompatibility. Apply this fix once per machine.


**If you've already applied this fix previously, skip this step.**

**Automated Installation (Recommended):**

For default Vitis installation (``/xilinx/<version>/Vitis``):

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh

For custom Vitis installation location:

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /custom/path/to/Vitis/bin

**Examples:**

::

   # Vitis 2024.2 at default location
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /xilinx/2024.2/Vitis/bin

   # Vitis 2023.2 at custom location
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2023.2/bin

   # Vitis on Windows drive (WSL)
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /mnt/c/Xilinx/Vitis/2024.1/bin

**Note:** This is a system-wide fix, only needs to be done once per machine.

Per-Project Setup (First Time Only)
-----------------------------------

Step 1: Build Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   For optimal debugging, always build with ``DEBUG=1``. This enables proper debug symbols and correct source path mapping.


::

   source /path/to/xilinx/Vitis/2023.2/settings64.sh
   cd /path/to/no-OS/projects/your_project
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

**What happens:**

-  Build runs with debug optimization (``‑O0``, no optimization)
-  Full debug symbols added (``‑g3``)
-  Source path mapping configured
-  First build automatically runs ``make project`` (generates BSP and FSBL)
-  Creates ``build/your_project.elf`` with debug symbols

Step 2: Open Vitis Classic Eclipse IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   make sdkopen

**What happens:**

-  The command automatically detects Vitis 2023.2-2024.x
-  Launches the **Classic Eclipse IDE** (not the Unified IDE)
-  Workspace opens at ``build/`` directory
-  Standard Eclipse workspace with ``.metadata/`` directory

Step 3: Create and Configure Debug (Manual)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Classic Eclipse requires manual debug configuration. This is a one-time setup per project.


**A. Open Debug Configurations Dialog:**

In the Vitis IDE menu bar:

-  Go to **Run** → **Debug Configurations...**
-  Or click the **Debug** toolbar button dropdown → **Debug Configurations...**

The "Debug Configurations" dialog will open.

**B. Create New Configuration:**

-  In the left panel, expand **"Single Application Debug"**
-  Click the **"New Configuration"** button (first icon in the toolbar - looks like a document with a star/plus)
-  A new configuration will be created (e.g., ``Debugger_-Default``)
-  You can rename it if desired (e.g., ``adrv904x-debug``)

**C. Configure Main Tab:**

The **"Main"** tab should be selected by default.

**Debug Type:**

-  Select **"Standalone Application Debug"** from the dropdown
-  (Not "Attach to running target" - we want to reset and program the system)

**Connection:**

-  Leave as **"Local"** (debugging via local JTAG connection)

**D. Configure Target Setup Tab:**

Click the **"Target Setup"** tab at the top.

**Hardware Platform:**

-  Should auto-populate with the path to your ``.xsa`` file
-  If empty, click **"Browse..."** and select ``system_top.xsa`` from your project root

**Bitstream File:**

-  Auto-populated from the XSA file
-  Path will be similar to: ``.../projects/your_project/system_top.bit``

**FSBL Configuration** (ZynqMP/Zynq-7000 only):

Check these boxes:

-  ☑ **Use FSBL flow for initialization**
-  ☑ **Reset entire system**
-  ☑ **Program FPGA**
-  ☑ **Initialize using FSBL**

**FSBL File:**

Browse to or enter the FSBL path:

::

   build/tmp/output/hw0/export/hw0/sw/hw0/boot/fsbl.elf

.. note::

   For MicroBlaze: Uncheck "Use FSBL flow for initialization" - MicroBlaze doesn't use FSBL


**Summary Panel:**

After configuration, the Summary panel on the right shows the debug sequence:

-  Reset system and clear FPGA
-  Program FPGA with bitstream
-  Initialize PS using FSBL
-  Load application and suspend processors

**E. Configure Application Tab:**

Click the **"Application"** tab at the top.

**Processor Selection:**

The IDE shows a table with available processors. Check the box next to your target processor:

-  **ZynqMP**: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` (or ``psu_cortexr5_0`` for R5)
-  **Zynq-7000**: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  **MicroBlaze**: ``microblaze_0``
-  **Versal**: ``psv_cortexa72_0``

**Project and Application:**

The IDE typically auto-populates these fields:

-  **Project**: Should show your project name (e.g., ``adrv904x``)
-  **Application**: Should point to your ELF file: ``build/your_project.elf``

.. tip::

   If the Application field is empty, click **"Search..."** and browse to ``build/your_project.elf``\


**Stop at 'main':**

-  Check this box to have the debugger stop at the ``main()`` function (recommended)

**F. Save and Apply:**

-  Click **"Apply"** to save the configuration
-  Click **"Debug"** to start debugging immediately, or **"Close"** to save for later

The configuration is now saved and ready to use!

Debugging Your Project
----------------------

Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect JTAG cable to your board
-  Connect UART cable (for console output)
-  Power on the board

Start Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In Vitis Classic Eclipse IDE:**

-  Make sure you've built with ``make DEBUG=1``
-  Go to **Run** → **Debug Configurations...**
-  Select your debug configuration (e.g., "adrv904x-debug")
-  Click **"Debug"** button
-  The Debug perspective will open automatically

**What happens:**

-  Vitis connects to board via JTAG
-  Programs FPGA with bitstream
-  Runs FSBL to initialize processor (ZynqMP/Zynq only)
-  Loads your application ELF
-  Stops at entry point (usually ``main()``) - ready to debug!

**Debug Features:**

-  Set breakpoints (click left margin in code)
-  Step through code (F5=Step Into, F6=Step Over, F7=Step Return, F8=Resume)
-  Inspect variables, registers, call stack
-  Watch expressions
-  View memory and disassembly

Daily Development Workflow
--------------------------

After initial setup:

::

   # 1. Edit code

   # 2. Build with debug symbols
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

   # 3. Debug
   make sdkopen
   # In Vitis Eclipse: Run → Debug Configurations → Select your config → Debug

Architecture-Specific Notes
---------------------------

**ZynqMP (Cortex-A53/R5):**

-  Processor: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` or ``psu_cortexr5_0``
-  FSBL Required: Yes
-  FSBL Path: ``build/tmp/output/hw0/export/hw0/sw/hw0/boot/fsbl.elf``

**Zynq-7000 (Cortex-A9):**

-  Processor: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  FSBL Required: Yes
-  FSBL Path: Same as ZynqMP

**MicroBlaze:**

-  Processor: ``microblaze_0``
-  FSBL Required: No (soft processor)
-  In debug config: Uncheck "Use FSBL flow for initialization"

**Versal (Cortex-A72):**

-  Processor: ``psv_cortexa72_0``
-  Uses PLM (Platform Loader Manager) instead of FSBL

Troubleshooting
---------------

**"Segmentation fault" when debugging:**

-  Solution: Install xsdb WSL2 fix (see above)

**Stepping doesn't work / variables optimized out:**

-  Solution: Rebuild with ``make clean && make DEBUG=1``

**IDE doesn't open or wrong IDE opens:**

-  Verify you're using Vitis 2023.2-2024.x
-  The Classic Eclipse IDE should open (not the Unified IDE)
-  If Unified IDE opens, the version detection may be incorrect

Theory of Operation
-------------------

The firmware uses many no-OS modules for accessing the various peripherals it needs for this project. The diagram below shows how these modules interact with the hardware and with each other. Of particular interest is the feedback loop from the embedded ADC that is periodically used to sample TX_DET and RX_DET at 1 Hz (provided by the embedded RTC) to the ``no_os_pid`` P.I.D. controller which computes a new set of gain values that are written back into the transceiver. This feedback loop is the core functionality of this system and it ensures that the wireless link operates with optimum gains at any distance that the ADMV9615 and ADMV9625 are set apart.


|image1|

A detailed view of this feedback loop is represented below, showing exactly what gains the feedback loop controls:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/admv96s-wgbe-ek1/algo.png
   :align: center
   :width: 800px

The firmware can also interact with a PC application over the serial line (UART). Upon boot, it prints boot messages at 115200 baudrate, then launches an ``iiod`` application that can be accessed from a PC using ``libiio`` over a serial backend at 345600 baudrate. The following existing PC applications may be used to interact with the firmware:

-  ``iio_info``, ``iio_attr`` (command-line tools from ```libiio`` <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio>`__)
-  :git-iio-oscilloscope:`iio-oscilloscope`
-  :doc:`Wethlink GUI </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/admv96s-wgbe-ek1/software>`

The fact that the firmware exposes the on-board devices as iio devices in a `standardized way <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/driver-api/iio/index.html>`_ means that it is easy to devise new applications that can interact with the firmware by simply using the ``libiio`` library.

The context contains information that is provisioned at manufacturing such as serial number, hardware revision etc. or information produced during the build process such as the firmware version. The ADMV9615 or ADMV9625 DIP switch state is also exposed as a context attribute and the firmware makes certain decisions based on it.

There are 6 exposed devices:

-  ``hmc6300`` - the transmitter or the ADMV96x5 module
-  ``hmc6301``- the receiver of the ADMV96x5 module
-  ``mwc`` - this device exposes attributes and channels that are specific to this project, such as the ``tx_det`` and ``rx_det`` ADC channels, attributes to enable/disable automatic gain control, attributes to write settings to non-volatile memory etc. (read "mwc" as "microwave connector")
-  ``adin1300`` - the Ethernet PHY
-  ``max24287`` - the RGMII to SGMII Serializer/Deserializer
-  ``adm1177`` - the input power monitor

LED
~~~

Each ADMV96S-WGBE-EK reference design board has a few LED's to convey information from the firmware to the user.

The blue LED is a *power good* LED and it only lights up if the input power is a clean 12V.

The 4 LED series at the top of the board convey the following information:

The following examples shows a board that has TX and RX VCO's locked, TX and RX autotuning on, TX_DET within tolerance of target but the firmware can't keep RX_DET within tolerance of target. To force this error, one of the boards facing each other was unplugged so the photographed board was trying to maximize the RX gains to receive something meaningful. But if there is no incoming signal, gain changes cannot possibly affect RX_DET so the firmware lights up the LED in red.

The RJ-45 connector also has embedded LED's. The top left one lights up green when the ADIN1300 has connected to another PHY over the Ethernet cable. This LED is briefly turned off when there is activity on the Ethernet cable essentially blinking it. So a blinking top left LED means both the Ethernet link is up and there is ongoing activity. The top right LED conveys link speed information and is turned off when link speed is 10 Mbps, lit green for 100 Mbps and lit amber when speed is 1000 Mbps.

EEPROM
~~~~~~

The 24LC32A EEPROM has 32Kb memory capacity (4 KB) and is connected to an I2C bus. The firmware uses the EEPROM to store non-volatile parameters to be loaded at boot.

In order not to waste space, and to make sure future iterations of the firmware may use areas of the EEPROM that are currently unused, a design decision had to be made from the start, as to what size a non-volatile parameter set should have. A reasonable size of 256 bytes was chosen, which makes it possible to fit 16 such parameter sets into the memory.

======= ================ ====
Address Name             Size
======= ================ ====
0x0     NVMP1            256
0x100   Reserved         3584
0xF00   Factory defaults 256
======= ================ ====

Two such areas are currently used by the firmware, one is the NVMP1 area which is the active configuration loaded at boot and the other one is the factory defaults configuration which can be copied into the active configuration with a certain procedure.

The 0x100 to 0x3FF memory area is not used.

Each NVMP area has 255 bytes of actual parameters and 1 last byte consisting of a CRC8 computed over the leading 255 bytes.

The CRC8 checksums are checked at boot and if they have been incorrectly written or tampered with, the parameters are not used. If no suitable parameters are found in NVMP1 or in the factory defaults area, a set of in-firmware hardcoded parameters are used for the boot.

Resetting to factory defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To explicitly reset to factory defaults, click the S3 button, keep it pressed and click the S2 button briefly. The four LED's will blink 10 times for about 3 seconds to confirm the reset to factory defaults has completed.

Production firmware and provisioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two versions of the firmware that are for *normal* and *production* use.

The *normal* firmware is the one that runs on the hardware, provided the hardware had gone through the production process fully. The production process has 3 main steps: actual hardware production, provisioning and testing.

The *production* firmware is a variant that has the following extra features:

-  It disregards whatever is in the EEPROM and loads up with hardcoded parameters.
-  It allows writing of the factory defaults area of the EEPROM by exposing the ``mwc.save_defaults`` attribute.
-  It allows provisioning by allowing the change of the serial number (``mwc.hw_serial``, ``mwc.carrier_serial``), revision (``mwc.hw_version``, ``mwc.carrier_version``) and model name (``mwc.carrier_model``) which all default to ``-`` when the device is not provisioned.

With a *normal* firmware, the device will not behave correctly if it was not provisioned. The firmware needs valid parameters to operate correctly so having ``-`` being displayed as carrier serial number is an indicator that the device hasn't somehow gone through the full production cycle that performs provisioning.

Autonegotiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-ADMV96S-WGBE-EK1 is a system composed of two independent boards that connect to the *outside* world through Ethernet. The network infrastructure at the other end of the Ethernet cable is not known yet the system can detect its capabilities in terms of data bandwidth and dulplex mode due to autonegotiation signaling at physical layer (OSI model).

The system may be connected at any time to devices on a network that have different capabilities. The device at one end could be able to talk 100 Mbps half-duplex, the one at the other end could be capable of 1 Gbps full-duplex. In this scenario, the system needs to adapt for the weakest link and configure the 100 Mbps half-duplex speed at all levels, it's the common denominator that allows the two devices to talk to each other.

Having two independent devices in a system, each running its own firmware, this could only be possible if there is some mechanism through which the devices could advertise speeds to one another. The wireless link carries SGMII interface and the SGMII itself has an autonegotiation mechanism through which a frame containing speed and duplex information can be passed on from one device to the other. The firmware uses this feature to propagate an Ethernet link speed change throughout the whole system.

   :align: center

Steps 1-4 are executed in an interrupt service routine from the PHY when link status changes.

Steps 5-6 are executed in an interrupt service routine from the SERDES when new autonegotiation page was received.

To resume this section:

-   there is speed and duplex mode autonegotiation at Ethernet level
-   there is speed and duplex mode autonegotiation at SGMII level
-   the lowest advertised speed of a device in the system is propagated and the system subsequently works at that speed

Temperature compensated gains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to reasons related to the transceiver hardware, the optimum gains at which it operates are temperature dependent. Affected gains are TX IF VGA, RX IF VGA and RX RF LNA. The optimum gains found through lab characterization are provided by Analog Devices.

The transceivers have a very coarse temperature sensor that is used by the firmware to look up gains in a lookup table. The default behavior of the firmware is to auto compensate gains for temperature using the factory default lookup tables.

You can disable auto compensation by unticking the checkbox, or you can keep it and adjust the tables to your liking.

15       40°C ... 75°C

P.I.D. controlled gains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TX_DET and RX_DET analog signals of the transceivers are sampled regularly by the embedded ADC of the microcontroller. They correspond to the TX and RX signal power and need to be kept in a certain sweetspot for proper operation of the wireless link.

The remaining gains, that aren't temperature controlled, are the TX RF VGA and the RX BB (COARSE1, COARSE2 and FINE). By controlling these gains up and down, one can see a change in the RX and RX power detectors.

So we have a feedback loop and we can apply control theory on it in the form of a P.I.D. algorithm to keep the TX_DET and RX_DET in the sweetspot by having the algorithm tweak the gains. The implementation actually only uses the proportional and integral coefficients, essentially making this a P.I. control.

Every second the algorithm is run for several iterations until it settles on a resulting gain. There are two challenges:

-  Make it settle fast! We don't care too much about overshoot, we care about settling fast because the algorithm is run on the main loop along with other things and we don't want to block for too long.
-  Make it settle with as little gain changes as possible! Any gain change will momentarily mess with the signals being sent in that instant across the wireless link, so by minimizing the gain changes, we minimize the bit error rate throughout the whole system.

To illustrate how the algorithm works, here's the result of a simulation with artificial perturbations at samples 100, 200, 300 and 400 in order to observe the characteristics of the control. The top part shows the output of the P.I. as an attenuation in steps between 0 and 31. The bottom part is a simulated RX_DET (mV) based on what attenuation the algorithm previously set.

   :align: center

With the factory default settings, the algorithm finds the target within 10 iterations or less and does it with few gain changes addressing both of the above points. As with any P.I.D. algorithm, it's possible that better behavior is achievable by experimentally fine tuning the coefficients but with the factory default coefficients and initial release implementation, the system achieves a bit error rate of less than 10E-10 for constant distance and across the whole -40°C to 80°C.
