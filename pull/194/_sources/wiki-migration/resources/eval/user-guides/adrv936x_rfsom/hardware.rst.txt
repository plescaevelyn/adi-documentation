ADRV936x RF SOM Hardware
========================

Whether you want to understand the changes between revisions, or just understand how to probe the PCB, this is where all the information should be.

ADRV936x - Mechanical
---------------------

The ADRV9361-Z7035 SDR 2X2 SOM uses a 20 layer PCB that measures 2.440” x 3.937” (62 mm x 100 mm). The 62mm x 100mm form factor is compatible with the DP10062 “Sick of Beige v1.0” specification from dangerousprototypes.com.

Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~

The MicroHeaders used on ADRV9361-Z7035 are FCI 0.8mm BergStak®100-position Dual Row, BTB Vertical Receptacles (61082-101400LF). These receptacles mate with any of the FCI 0.8mm BergStak® 100-position Dual Row BTB Vertical Plugs (61083-10x400LF) to provide variable stack heights of 5mm, 6mm, 7mm or 8mm. The SOM uses the FCI “receptacle” while carrier cards use the “plug”. Both receptacle and plug include a PCB locator peg that can be used to design precisely mated SOM and carrier layouts.

Dimensions
~~~~~~~~~~

The physical dimensions of the connectors, mounting holes and PCB is common between the ADRV9361-Z7035 and the ADRV9364-Z7020.

ADRV9361-Z7035 Hardware
-----------------------

Revision F
~~~~~~~~~~

This is the current shipping version.

.. admonition:: Download
   :class: download

   
   -  `Rev F Schematics <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv9361-z7035/02-038702-01-f2.pdf>`_
   -  `BOM (7 zipped) <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv9361-z7035/05-038702-01-f2.7z>`_
   


-  Changes from Rev E to Rev F:

   -  The schematic did not change. We only made an adjustment to the layout.
   -  The RF traces were modified to improve the insertion loss and the return loss as well as the EVM.

      -  This resulted in some layout changes for discrete capacitors

   -  On the SOM the revision is shown as "F2" on the PCB artwork
   -  The reset button moved position

Revision E
~~~~~~~~~~

   -  `Rev E BOM <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv936x_rfsom/05_038702-e.xlsx>`_
   


Revision C (First publicly available revision)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first publicly available revision.

Why do a Rev D?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Improved the power structure and increased the 0.95V current from 2A to 6A
-   Added a `1000BASE-KX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet#1000BASE-KX>`_ option for the Ethernet Phy (Ethernet Operation over Electrical Backplanes)
-  Improved the layout to accommodate the power changes.

ADRV9364-Z7020 Hardware

Revision D
~~~~~~~~~~

This is the current shipping version.

   -  `Rev D1 Schematics <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv936x_rfsom/adrv9364-z7020_revd-1.pdf>`_
   
      -  There was a small typo in the rev D0 of the schematics (below), the net named ``*_EN_AGC``, was tied to the ``ENABLE`` pin, and the net called ``*_ENABLE`` was tied to the ``EN_AGC`` pin. This is fixed/updated in this schematic. copper/layout does not change, only the designation on the wire (for clarity).
   
   -  `Rev D Schematics <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv936x_rfsom/adrv9364-z7020_revd.pdf>`_
   
      -  This has the notation error described above.

Why do a Rev D?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Improved the power structure and increased the 1V current from 2A to 4A

   -  Improved the layout to accommodate the power changes.

-  Added a `1000BASE-KX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet#1000BASE-KX>`_ option for the Ethernet Phy (Ethernet Operation over Electrical Backplanes)
-  Improved the RF traces to have better insertion loss and return loss.

Carrier Support
---------------

The ADRV9361-Z7035 supports all features on the :adi:`ADRV1CRR-FMC <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADRV1CRR-FMC.html>` carrier board. The ADRV9364-Z7020 supports a subset of features because the Zynq Z7020 has fewer available user I/Os. For the ADRV9364-Z7020 it is recommended to use the :adi:`ADRV1CRR-BOB <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADRV1CRR-BOB.html>` carrier.
