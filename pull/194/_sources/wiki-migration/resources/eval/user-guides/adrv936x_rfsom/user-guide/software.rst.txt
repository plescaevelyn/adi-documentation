ADRV9361-Z7035 User Guide - Software
====================================

The Zynq SoC onboard the ADRV9361-Z7035 SDR 2X2 contains Dual ARM® Cortex™-A9 MPCore™ processors capable of running a variety of operating systems and is supported by an ecosystem of development tools.

Getting Started
---------------

To quickly explore the reference design, here are some resources:

-  The :doc:`SD Card Image </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/zynq_images>` used to boot the reference design.
-  The Analog Devices :doc:`ADRV9361-Z7035 SDR Wiki </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv936x_rfsom>` provides details about reference designs
-  The :git-hdl>`__, `no-OS <https::`HDL </github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>` and `Linux <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/linux>`_ sources are hosted on GitHub

   -  For HDL, we highly recommend cloning from the latest official tag (released twice per year), not the development branch. :git-hdl:`releases`

      -  For example, choose branch hdl_2015_r2 to get the second release of 2015. Notice the support Xilinx Vivado tool version.

   -  The TCL scripts to build the Vivado project for this carrier are located in /projects/pzsdr/ccfmc
   -  The :doc:`ADI Reference Designs HDL User Guide </wiki-migration/resources/fpga/docs/hdl>` explains how to rebuild the FPGA project.

NOTE: The reference design is based on the HDL code maintained by Analog Devices. To manage dependencies in the build process for Vivado projects, Analog Devices provides Linux-based makefiles. We recommend that Windows users build Vivado projects using ‘make’ under CYGWIN. Instructions to install a minimal version of CYGWIN that will provide a Linux-like environment under Windows are available here.

Operating Systems
-----------------

The following operating Systems are supported on the Zynq ARM processors. The most up-to-date and comprehensive list can be found `here <https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/software-zone/embedded-computing.html#os>`_ on the Xilinx web site, however the following section will give you an idea of the popular options. Most software developers will start with the Linux reference design and drivers provided by Analog Devices at the GitHub page listed below. Analog Devices also have a wiki page that provides details of their Linux reference design for ADRV9361-Z7035 SDR :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv936x_rfsom>`.
