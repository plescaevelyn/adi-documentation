AD-FMCOMMS11-EBZ User Guide
===========================

The AD-FMComms11-EBZ board is a system platform board for communication infrastructure applications that demonstrates the Direct to RF (DRF) transmitter and observation receiver architecture. Using high sample rate RFDAC(s) and RFADC(s), a number of components in previous generation transmitters can be eliminated, such as mixers, modulators, IF amplifiers and filters. The objective being to bring the ADC or DAC as close to the antenna as possible, leading to possibly more cost effective and efficient communications solution. It is composed of multi-GSps RF ADC :adi:`AD9625` and DAC :adi:`AD9162`, Cheetah and Barium respectively. The transmit path contains a balun, low pass filter, gain block and variable attenuation to produce an output appropriate for a power amplifier module. Along the observation path, the PA output is coupled back into the board through a variable attenuator, a balun and finally the ADC. Clock management is taken care of on board; all the necessary clocks are generated from a reference. Power management is present as well. We will provide typical performance data for the entire range (70 MHz – 6 GHz) which is supported by the platform. This is primarily for system investigation and bring up of various waveforms from a software team before their custom hardware is complete, where they want to see waveforms, but are not concerned about the last 1dB or 1% EVM of performance.
