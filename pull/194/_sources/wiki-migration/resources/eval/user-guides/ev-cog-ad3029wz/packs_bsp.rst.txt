Software Packs & Board Support Package
======================================

<note > **There are no seperate toolchain,On-Board Peripheral Drivers & Software for EV-COG-AD3029WZ, the toolchain,On-Board Peripheral Drivers & Software for EV-COG-AD3029LZ works with EV-COG-AD3029WZ.The user needs to change only the pin muxing based on the application.For help regarding pinmapping refer to the Hardware Details section.** 

A modular software framework is provided for quick application prototyping.
Based on the application use case, developers need to download the respective
software packs.

.. important::

   Please make sure you install either of the below toolchain before installing
   any of the below packs

   
   -  IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM 8.20.1 or higher
