Product Details
---------------

The Triton Quad-Apollo System Development Platform contains four :adi:`AD9084` software defined, direct X-Band Quad-MxFE, as well as associated RF front-ends, clocking, and power circuitry. The target application is phased array radars, electronic warfare, and ground-based SATCOM, specifically a **16 transmit/16 receive channel** direct X-Band sampling phased array at L/S/C/X-Band (0.1 GHz to ~12GHz). The Rx & Tx RF front-end has drop-in configurations that allow for customized frequency ranges up to Ku-Band (12-18GHz), depending on the end user’s application.

The ADXBAND16EBZ System Development Platform highlights a complete system solution. It is intended as a testbed for demonstrating multi-chip synchronization as well as the implementation of system level calibrations, beamforming algorithms, and other signal processing algorithms. The system is designed to mate with a `VCU118 <https://www.xilinx.com/VCU118>`_ Evaluation Board from Xilinx®, which features the Virtex® UltraScale+™ XCVU9P FPGA, with provided reference software, HDL code, and MATLAB system-level interfacing.

In addition to the ADXBAND16EBZ Digitizing Card, the kit also contains a 16Tx/16Rx Calibration Board that is used to develop system-level calibration algorithms, or otherwise more easily demonstrate power-up phase determinism in situations pertinent to their own use case. The Calibration Board also allows the user to demonstrate combined-channel dynamic range, spurious, and phase noise improvements and can also be controlled via MATLAB add-on when connected to the PMOD interface of the `VCU118 <https://www.xilinx.com/VCU118>`_.

The system can be used to enable quick time-to-market development programs for applications like:

-  ADEF (Phased-Array, RADAR, EW, SATCOM)
-  Communications Infrastructure (Multiband 5G and mmWave 5G)
-  Electronic Test and Measurement

General Description
-------------------

This user guide serves as the main source of information for system engineers and software developers using the ADXBAND16EBZ System Evaluation Board, which contains four :adi:`AD9084` software defined, direct X-Band Sampling Phased Array Development Platform, as well as associated RF front-end, clocking, and power circuitry. The target application is phased array radars, electronic warfare, and ground-based SATCOM, specifically a 16 transmit/16 receive channel direct X-Band sampling phased array at L/S/C/X-Band (0.1 GHz to ~12GHz). The Rx RF front-end has by-pass configurations that allow for customized frequency ranges up to Ku-band, depending on the end user’s application.

The ADXBAND16EBZ System Evaluation Board highlights a complete system solution. It is intended as a testbed for demonstrating multi-chip synchronization as well as implementation of system level calibrations, beam forming algorithms, and other signal processing algorithms. The board is designed to mate with a `VCU118 <https://www.xilinx.com/VCU118>`_ Evaluation Board from Xilinx®, which features the Virtex® UltraScale+™ XCVU9P FPGA, with provided reference software and HDL code.
