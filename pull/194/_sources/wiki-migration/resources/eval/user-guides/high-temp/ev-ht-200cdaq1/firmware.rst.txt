EV-HT-200CDAQ1 Firmware Guide
=============================

Purpose
-------

This document is intended to provide firmware developers an introduction into the code structure and specifics on some of the time critical functions. It should be used in conjunction with the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 / HT-DAB-1 Keil MDK project that is available on the `ADI GitHub <http://www.github.com/analogdevicesinc/hightemp>`_

The project controls the activity of the EV-HT-200CDAQ1, which has three Analog
Devices ADCs, an analog multiplexer and conditioning circuitry. Users can send
commands to the board via a PC (COM port over USB). The board will respond by
either executing the command or issuing an error message. Responses to commands
are transmitted on the UART back to the PC.

Source and Header File Organization

UART input ("uart.c")
---------------------

A PC will be able to send information to the MCU via a USB to UART converter.
The PC can command various activities including: a conversion sequence to begin,
set a second counter value or request a temperature reading.

UART settings are:

-  Baud rate = 2 Mbits/sec, 8-bits data, 0 parity, 1 stop (8N1)
-  Hardware handshaking enabled. (CTS/RTS) {Note: RTS is not physically connected. Data coming from PC to MCU will be minimal and the MC’s UART will not overflow.}
-  No CRC on frame

UART receive software is implemented in an ISR when the FIFO buffer has information available. Inside the ISR, a character string is buffered in a 128-byte array, with start pointer = \*pui8RxHead.

Parsing (“parser.c”)
--------------------

As part of the main loop, the “ParseCommand” function is called. This will analyze the UART “RxBuffer”. When an end of string character (“\\r”) is received, the string is compared against valid commands. All command strings begin with “\ :math:`”. Invalid command strings will result in an “`\ ERROR:” response on the UART transmitter. Using the backspace character to correct typing errors is allowed. The use of the back and forward arrows to edit an input string is not supported.

Valid commands will prompt further actions. Status and Mode information is set
for a subset of the commands in global variables “m_iStatus” with “StatusEnum”
enumeration and “m_iRunMode” with “runModeEnum” enumeration. This information is
used inside the UART output and ADC convert engines.

ADC sampling (“sampling_engine.c”)
----------------------------------

When prompted via a valid UART command, an ADC sampling sequence (“experiment”)
is initiated. “m_iStatus” and “m_iRunMode” variables indicate a pending
experiment. There are four cases possible:

-  Iterative Burst mode (Iteration rate set by “$setexp” command)
-  Single shot burst mode
-  Continuous mode
-  External trigger burst mode.

For iterative burst and single shot burst, the second (1/60 of a minute) counter
ISR will check the status and mode information and commence the experiment. That
will force the first experiment in these two modes to align with the second
counter rollover event.

The MCU will use the SPI interface to clock data out of the ADC. The conversion
start signal is generated with a timer which allows precise sampling period
control and a precise pulse width needed for the CNV input signal to the ADC.
Before the next conversion starts, the data from the present conversion is
clocked out completely. This will eliminate any clock noise from corrupting the
analog input during the conversion time.

The ADC Data Out signal will go to a high impedance state when a conversion is
being made. To reduce current consumption and eliminate potential switching
noise, the MCU’s internal pull-up resistor (~33kΩ) is enabled on all MISO pins.

The ADC servicing is done in the timer interrupt service routine. The conversion
will begin on the rising edge of a timer output and the ISR is called on the
falling edge as shown in diagram below.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/high-temp/ev-ht-200cdaq1/firmware_adcreadseq.png
   :align: center

Data collected from the ADC is stored in a dedicated 16kbyte (16,384) buffer
that will later be sent out a UART port to a PC host. The buffer can be divided
into segments for different ADC channels as set by the incoming command. The
16kbyte buffer is storing 16-bit conversions, thus this is an 8Ksample buffer.

.. important::

   To achieve the fastest sampling rate, software was written in a
   non-conventional way and the compiler optimization must be set to level 3 for
   maximum performance. Some compilers automatically store all registers before
   starting an ISR. This is not allowed if 2.4ųs conversion rates are expected.

SPI Setup
~~~~~~~~~

The SPI clock is set to 25 MHz. This is half the MCU system clock and the
fastest achievable SPI master clock from the VA10800. Special settings are
required to make this operate correctly at this speed. The data in (MISO) of the
MCU must be setup to capture the ADC’s output on the falling edge of the SPI SCK
signal. The filtering for these pins must be disabled and the synchronous
setting disabled. FILTER = 0x1.

Aligning CNV signals for ADC0 & ADC1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the sampling timing requirements is that the CNV signals for ADC0 and
ADC1 being exactly aligned. This is accomplished by using the cascade function
of the Vorago timers. One timer, TIM_0, is used to trigger two other timers that
create the CNV signals using the PWM function.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/high-temp/ev-ht-200cdaq1/firmware_timer_cascade.png
   :align: right

External Trigger Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External trigger mode allows an external signal to dictate when a burst
experiment commences. To still allow simultaneous conversions on ADC0 and ADC1,
the same scheme as outlined in section 6.2 is used with the addition of TIM0
being triggered using its cascade 1 input from PORTB[14] pin interrupt. As a
rising edge is detected on PORTB[14], an interrupt request is generated which
will put TIM0 in active mode which will quickly count to zero and trigger TIM2
and TIM20. Note that the pin interrupt does not generate an interrupt to the CPU
since the IRQSEL peripheral is not configured to do this.

VCC and RTD Sampling with Burst
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The viewer program on the PC expects VCC and RTD information to go along with
every burst sequence. Four samples of channel 8 (VCC) and channel 9 (RTD) are
conducted at the end of each burst sequence. An average is calculated and
reported as the first line of each Burst experiment UART output sequence. The
sample rate for these conversions is set to 10ųs independent of what the $setacq
calls out. This was done to ensure the analog multiplexer and associated op-amp
have time to stabilize.

UART output (“output.c” & “uart.c”)
-----------------------------------

The UART is the primary communication channel from the MCU to a user. It is
routed through a UART to USB converter to a PC’s USB port. A virtual serial
communication port program such as PuTTY can be used to collect the data.
(TeraTerm did not support 2Mbit/sec rates and could not be used)

UART settings are:

-  Baud rate = 2 Mbits/sec, 8 bits data, 0 parity, 1 stop (8N1)
-  Flow control signals must be used. Windows OS only services the COM ports periodically and if there are several programs running or the display is being refreshed, the PC cannot keep up with 2Mbit/sec data flow. It was required to implement CTS on the MCU to gate the transmission of data.
-   No CRC on frame. (No acknowledgement on message being received)

Data buffered from the ADC is stored in 16-bit integer format. Data sent out the
UART will be a 5-byte stream in hexadecimal ASCII including a “comma” delimiter.
(i.e. ABCD,1234,)

Free RTOS Shell
---------------

The code is written in a FreeRTOS shell. This will allow users to create their
own code without interfering with the data acquisition and reporting processes.
A compiler directive in “ht_dab_user.h” can enable or disable the use of
FreeRTOS. By commenting out the line with “#define USE_RTOS 1”, the RTOS code is
removed from the project.

.. important::

   The downloaded version of FreeRTOS will completely stop all interrupts from
   occurring for a short period during the task change. For sampling rates of
   4us or less, this can result in corrupt ADC reads. Software has been added to
   check for the sampling rate and to temporarily disable the RTOS during an
   experiment.

The below diagram shows the priority hierarchy. The OS will jump between the
data acquisition task and the User task. Interrupts are implemented for the ADC
sampling, the tick timer and the UART receive process. Either the data
acquisition task or the user task can be interrupted when one of these events
occurs.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/high-temp/ev-ht-200cdaq1/firmware_taskdiagram.png
   :align: center

Due to some inherent interrupt blocking of FreeRTOS during task changes, a
conflict can arise when the ADCs are being converted very rapidly, under 4us.
During an acquisition experiment with sampling rate under 4us, the RTOS is
temporarily disabled.

Housekeeping
------------

Watchdog Timer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One timer is used to create a watchdog timer. If the timer is not serviced
within a countdown interval, the MCU will be RESET and the RESET source will be
WATCHDOG. The watchdog period is defined in ht_dab_user.h.

Unused Port Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All unused port pins are terminated using an internal pull-down resistor. This
reduces current draw from floating inputs.

Temperature and Vcc Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RTD data sheet contains a table with resistance values for every 1°C.
Firmware has created a linear interpolation conversion program for 5 different
regions in the -55°C to 200°C range.

Both the RTD and VCC calculations account for a voltage divider network.

.. important::

   RTD and VCC calculations were modified to account for two 100kΩ resistors
   used to bias the output of the Analog Multiplexor. See the schematic for
   details on this.

Performance
-----------

This section contains information on the MCU response time, maximum conversion
rates and approximate code size for various tasks.

ADC Sample Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As shown in the below diagram, the fastest ADC sample rate using interrupt is
413 kHz which corresponds to 2.4ųs.

UART RX Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCU must be able to receive a 64-character string from the host PC at a baud
rate of 2Mbps. This type of packet will not happen in rapid succession.

UART TX Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to bandwidth limitations of a PC’s USB port, flow control (CTS signal
enabled) must be implemented on the UART transmitter. The UART module will
automatically pause when the PC is not ready to accept more characters. The Tx
performance is 100% dependent on the PC capability. We have seen cases where
display refresh activity can slow the USB port down immensely.

If transmission of sample data does not complete before the next sampling
period, the next sampling period will be dropped entirely with no message.

CPU Processing Margin and Memory Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RTOS scheduler is allocating 50% of the CPU bandwidth for handling the
acquisition task. Some activities are interrupt driven and the actual CPU cycles
spent on these are dependent on sampling rate and amount of data being
transmitted to a PC. The following table can be used to estimate the available
CPU bandwidth.
