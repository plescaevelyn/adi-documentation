Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW` is a full-featured evaluation board for the :adi:`ADBMS6830B`, a 16-channel battery stack monitor for broad market applications. This board allows multiple boards to be linked through a single twisted pair wire interface (isoSPI) to monitor a long series of cells in a stack. It provides access to full channel monitoring to all cells going to battery pack either in the supply line or in the V+ to V- line. The evaluation board also features reversible isoSPi that can access either path to do measurement functions and serve as a redundant communication path. The PCB, components, and DuraClik connectors are optimized for low EMI susceptibility and emissions.

The :adi:`EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW` can communicate to a PC by connecting an :adi:`EVAL-ADBMS6822` dual master isoSPI together with a microcontroller board such as the :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CK1Z <SDP-K1>` (SDP-K1), the :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL`, or the MAX32670 base board.

The SDP-K1 and the other MCUs mentioned above provide a standard SPI interface, which can be translated to isoSPI port (J3 or J4 connector). A separate EVAL-ADBMS6822 companion board provides two SPI-to-isoSPI channels for reversible operation.

Components and Connections
--------------------------

Cell Voltage Connection (J1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Correct wiring must be followed to avoid the risk of damaging the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW evaluation board.


When connected to a battery stack, the cell group being monitored provides power for the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW.

-  To connect the cell group, separate the screw-terminal block section from the J1 connector.
-  Insert the cell voltage connections or resistors into the screw-terminal clamping contacts. These connections provide power and input stimuli for the battery stack monitor IC.

The cell voltages are wired to J1, starting from position 1 (the most negative potential of the group). See Table 1 for the correct J1 pinout.

<note 80% tip>Alternatively, resistors can be used to simulate battery cell voltages. 100 Ω ½ W or equivalent resistors are recommended because 100 Ω (or lower values) typically will not induce measurement errors, and the ½ W (or greater rating) will keep the resistor temperatures low, preventing power dissipation damage. 

Resistors Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Carefully connect 16 100 Ω resistors into the screw-terminal block between each CPIN input clamping contact from position 1 to position 17, EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW J1 pinout, and the resistor divider string.

   :width: 150px

-  Provide a stack equivalent power supply connection to position 17 (positive) and position 1 (negative).
-  Adjust power supply to provide the desired nominal cell voltage (for example, 52.8 V will be 3.3 V per cell).

Serial Interface Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

isoSPI is the only communication option for the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW. Due to the custom EMI-optimized isoSPI cable with DuraClik connectors, it is highly recommended to use the EVAL-ADBMS6822 dual master isoSPI demo board or equivalent for easy plug-and-play operation.

The EVAL-ADBMS6822 dual master isoSPI demo board can be connected as a typical single-ended isoSPI bus master or to both ends of a reversible configuration with two isoSPI bus masters.

Optional Connections

GPIO Optional Header (J5)

IREG Optional Header (J2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This pair of thru-holes can be used to measure IREG with an ammeter. The use of an ammeter bypasses the D2 LED (VREG active), which allows accurate measurement of IREG current.

Add an ammeter between J2 pins 1 and 2 to measure IREG.

SUPPLY Optional Header (J6)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This pair of thru-holes can be used to insert and measure the supplied voltage with a power supply or voltmeter, respectively.

To furnish power separately from the cell stack, remove R55 and the power board using J6.

General Setup
-------------

.. important::

   To prevent damage to the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW, see Table 1 in `#16_resistor_connection <https://wiki.analog.com/>`_ to confirm that the cell voltage connections to the screw-terminal block matches the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW J1 pinout.

   
   The 2-wire twisted pair cable with the DuraClik end plugs have 1 mm thick locking tabs on the wiring side that must be pressed down to release from the DuraClik receptacles. Failure to do so may damage the cable and prevent board-to-board isoSPI communication.


EVAL-ADBMS6822 to EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW Typical isoSPI Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   This setup uses the SDP-K1 as microcontroller, but users may also use the :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL` as MCU and follow the same connection procedure presented below.


A typical isoSPI connection begins with the isoSPI master connected to the first (or bottom) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW. Additional EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW boards can be daisy-chained onto the isoSPI bus. Communication begins with the first (or bottom) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW, then to the next upper EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW, and finally to the last (or top) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW.

EVAL-ADBMS6822 to EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW Reverse isoSPI Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   This setup uses the SDP-K1 as microcontroller, but users may also use the :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL` as MCU and follow the same connection procedure presented below.


A reverse isoSPI connection begins with the isoSPI master connected to the last (or top) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW. Additional EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW boards can be daisy-chained onto the isoSPI bus. Communication begins from the last (or top) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW, then to the next lower EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW, and finally to the first (or bottom) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW.

EVAL-ADBMS6822 to EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW Redundant isoSPI Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   This setup uses the SDP-K1 as microcontroller, but users may also use the :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL` as MCU and follow the same connection procedure presented below.


A redundant isoSPI connection begins with the primary (or main) isoSPI master connected to the first (or bottom) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW and has a backup auxiliary isoSPI master connected to the last (or top) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW. Additional EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW boards can be daisy-chained between the two isoSPI masters on the isoSPI bus. Primary (or main) communication begins with the first (or bottom) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW then to the upper EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW and finally, to the last (or top) EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW. The backup auxiliary communication begins in the reverse direction to provide coverage when a possible isoSPI daisy-chain break occurs.
