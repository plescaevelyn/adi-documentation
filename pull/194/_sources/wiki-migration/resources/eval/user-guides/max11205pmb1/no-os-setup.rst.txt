MAX11205PMB1 Overview
---------------------

The MAX11205PMB1 peripheral module provides the necessary hardware to interface the MAX11205 16-bit ADC to any system that utilizes Pmod™-compatible expansion ports configurable for GPIO interface. The IC is an ultra-low-power (< 300µA max active current), high-resolution, serial-output ADC. This device provides the highest resolution per unit power in the industry and is optimized for applications that require very high dynamic range with low power, such as sensors on a 4mA to 20mA industrial control loop. The voltage reference for the IC is supplied by a MAX6037 (2.5V) that is also on the module. The filtered power-supply voltage from the host can be optionally passed (jumper selectable) through a MAX8510 ultra-low-noise LDO, allowing empirical evaluation of performance with different power sources.

Hardware Specifications
-----------------------

Power Supply Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MAX11205PMB1 board has to be supplied with a voltage between 1.7V and +3.6V . If using directly with a PMOD connector, the host board should be capable of providing the 3.3V supply.

Digital Interface (PMOD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMOD interface is a series of standardized digital interfaces for various digital communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, and UART. These interface types were standardized by Digilent, which is now a division of National Instruments. Complete details on the PMOD specification can be found `here <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_.

The specific interface used for the MAX11205PMB1 boards is SPI.

ADI No-OS
---------

The goal of ADI Microcontroller No-OS is to be able to provide reference projects for lower end processors, which can't run Linux, or aren't running a specific operating system, to help those customers using microcontrollers with ADI parts. ADI No-OS offers **generic drivers** which can be used as a base for any microcontroller platform and also **example projects** which are using these drivers on various microcontroller platforms.

For more information about ADI No-OS and supported microcontroller platforms see: :doc:`no-OS </wiki-migration/resources/no-os>`

No-OS Build Setup
-----------------

No-OS Clone
~~~~~~~~~~~

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive `no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects:

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

Fore more details about the available make rules, :doc:`check out this page </wiki-migration/resources/no-os/make>`.

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

::

    * It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
    * You must have all updates installed in WSL.
        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

::

    * You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
    * You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers: 

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

::

    * Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

::

    * To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

::

    * If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive `no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects: 

.. collapsible:: Linux (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Make sure the GNU Make version you are using is >= 4.2.

   .. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

      To build a project, type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=...

      The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





   .. collapsible:: Mbed (Click to expand)

      .. important::

         Make sure that the virtual environment is activated (environment name enclosed in parenthesis appears in the git terminal) and that the packages from prerequisites were installed.


      To build a project, type:

      ::

         make PLATFORM=mbed TARGET_BOARD=...

      The ``TARGET_BOARD`` specifies the board for which the project is built. If not specified, it defaults to ``SDP-K1``.





   .. collapsible:: ADuCM3029 (Click to expand)

      ::

         $ export PLATFORM=aducm3029
         $ make





   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      Assuming you've installed STM32CubeMX at C:\\stm32cubemx and STM32CubeIDE to C:\\stm32cubeide, run these commands prior to building to let the build system know where they are installed:

      ::

         $ export STM32CUBEMX=/c/stm32cubemx
         $ export STM32CUBEIDE=/c/stm32cubeide

      Make sure you have the .ioc file in the project directory, then type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=stm32

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.



The build process creates a **build** directory in the project folder:

::

   build
   ├── app
   ├── bsp
   ├── obj
   ├── project_name.elf
   └── tmp

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

Fore more details about the available make rules, :doc:`check out this page </wiki-migration/resources/no-os/make>`.

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

::

    * It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
    * You must have all updates installed in WSL.
        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

::

    * You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
    * You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers:

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

::

    * Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

::

    * To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

::

    * If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive `no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects: 

.. collapsible:: Linux (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Make sure the GNU Make version you are using is >= 4.2.

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.



The build process creates a **build** directory in the project folder:

::

   build
   ├── app
   ├── bsp
   ├── obj
   ├── project_name.elf
   └── tmp

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

Fore more details about the available make rules, :doc:`check out this page </wiki-migration/resources/no-os/make>`.

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

::

    * It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
    * You must have all updates installed in WSL.
        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

::

    * You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
    * You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers:

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

::

    * Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

::

    * To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub

   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

::

    * If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

++++ Debugging with Vitis 2025.1 (Unified IDE) \|

.. important::

   Starting with Vitis 2023.2, Xilinx transitioned from Eclipse to a Unified IDE architecture. Vitis 2025.1 now features automatic debug configuration - no manual setup required!


**Key Changes in Vitis 2025.1:**

-  Debug configuration **automatically generated** by build system
-  Bitstream and initialization files **auto-extracted** from XSA
-  Architecture-specific settings **auto-configured** (ZynqMP, Zynq, MicroBlaze, Versal)
-  Just click **FLOW → Debug** to start debugging!

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Vitis 2025.1 installed
-  Hardware design file (.xsa) in project directory
-  JTAG and UART cables connected to target board

WSL2 Users: One-Time xsdb Fix
-----------------------------

.. important::

   On WSL2, xsdb crashes with "Segmentation fault" due to rlwrap incompatibility. Apply this fix once per machine.


**If you've already applied this fix previously, skip this step.**

**Automated Installation (Recommended):**

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh

**Manual Installation:**

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS

   # Backup original
   sudo cp /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb.original

   # Install fixed version
   sudo cp tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/xsdb-nowrap /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb
   sudo chmod +x /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb

**Note:** This is a system-wide fix, only needs to be done once per machine.

Per-Project Setup (First Time Only)
-----------------------------------

Step 1: Build Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   For optimal debugging, always build with ``DEBUG=1``. This enables proper debug symbols and correct source path mapping.


::

   source /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/settings64.sh
   cd /path/to/no-OS/projects/your_project
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

**What happens:**

-  Build runs with debug optimization (``‑O0``, no optimization)
-  Full debug symbols added (``‑g3``)
-  Source path mapping configured (``‑fdebug‑prefix‑map``)
-  First build automatically runs ``make project`` (generates BSP and FSBL)
-  Creates ``build/your_project.elf`` with debug symbols

.. tip::

   Without DEBUG=1, you'll experience:

   
   -  Code stepping doesn't work properly (optimized code)
   -  Variables optimized out and not visible
   -  Breakpoints may not hit expected lines
   


Step 2: Open Vitis IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   make sdkopen

**First time only:** When Vitis opens, you'll see "Update Workspace" dialog:

-  Message: "Vitis IDE cannot recognize the workspace version. Click 'Update' to initialize the workspace metadata."
-  Click **"Update"** button
-  This initializes the workspace (one-time setup)

**What happens automatically:**

-  Vitis opens at project root
-  Workspace metadata initialized
-  ``_ide/`` directory created
-  **Bitstream extracted** from XSA to ``_ide/system_top/system_top.bit``
-  **Initialization script extracted** (``psu_init.tcl`` or ``ps_init.tcl``)
-  **Debug configuration generated** (``_ide/launch.json``) with:

   -  Correct architecture settings (ZynqMP/Zynq/MicroBlaze/Versal)
   -  Hardware platform path (XSA file)
   -  FSBL configuration (if applicable)
   -  Application ELF path
   -  Target processor

.. note::

   No manual configuration needed! The debug configuration is ready to use immediately.


Step 3: Verify Configuration (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to verify or customize the auto-generated configuration:

#. In Vitis Explorer, expand ``_ide`` folder
#. Open ``launch.json`` to view the configuration
#. Configuration named ``<project_name>_app_hw_1`` is ready to use

The configuration is automatically regenerated each time you run ``make sdkopen``.

Debugging Your Project
----------------------

Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect JTAG cable to your board
-  Connect UART cable (for console output)
-  Power on the board

Start Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In Vitis IDE:**

#. Make sure you've built with ``make DEBUG=1``
#. Click **FLOW** panel (left side) → Click **"Debug"**
#. Debug session starts immediately!

.. warning::

   The Start Debugging (F5) button in the Debug panel does not currently work for Vitis 2025.1. Always use FLOW → Debug button.


**What happens:**

#. Vitis connects to board via JTAG
#. Programs FPGA with bitstream
#. Runs FSBL to initialize processor (ZynqMP/Zynq only)
#. Loads your application ELF
#. Stops at entry point - ready to debug!

**Debug Features:**

-  Set breakpoints (click left margin in code)
-  Step through code (F5=Step Into, F6=Step Over, F7=Step Return, F8=Resume)
-  Inspect variables, registers, call stack
-  Watch expressions
-  View memory and disassembly

Daily Development Workflow
--------------------------

After initial setup:

::

   # 1. Edit code

   # 2. Build with debug symbols
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

   # 3. Open Vitis and debug
   make sdkopen
   # Click FLOW → Debug → Debugging starts immediately!

.. tip::

   For production builds (no debugging), use ``make`` without ``DEBUG=1`` to get optimized code.


Architecture-Specific Notes
---------------------------

The build system automatically detects your hardware architecture and configures debug settings appropriately.

**ZynqMP (Cortex-A53/R5):**

-  Processor: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` or ``psu_cortexr5_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-zu``
-  FSBL Required: Yes (auto-configured)
-  Init Script: ``psu_init.tcl``

**Zynq-7000 (Cortex-A9):**

-  Processor: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-zynq``
-  FSBL Required: Yes (auto-configured)
-  Init Script: ``ps_init.tcl``

**MicroBlaze:**

-  Processor: ``microblaze_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-mb``
-  FSBL Required: No (auto-configured)

**Versal (Cortex-A72):**

-  Processor: ``psv_cortexa72_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-versal``
-  Uses PLM (Platform Loader Manager) instead of FSBL (auto-configured)

Troubleshooting
---------------

**"Segmentation fault" when debugging:**

-  Solution: Install xsdb WSL2 fix (see above)

**Debug doesn't start / "undefined" connection errors:**

-  Make sure you clicked "Update" on first workspace open
-  Verify ``_ide/launch.json`` exists
-  Try ``make sdkopen`` again to regenerate configuration

**Stepping doesn't work / variables optimized out:**

-  Solution: Rebuild with ``make clean && make DEBUG=1``

++++ Debugging with Vitis 2023.2-2024.x (Classic Eclipse IDE) \|

.. important::

   The ``make sdkopen`` command automatically detects Vitis 2023.2-2024.x and launches the Classic Eclipse IDE (using the ``-classic`` flag) instead of the Unified IDE. This provides better stability and complete debug configuration support for makefile-based projects.


.. warning::

   Manual debug configuration required for Classic Eclipse mode. For automatic configuration, upgrade to Vitis 2025.1+.


**Why Classic Mode for Vitis 2023.2-2024.x?**

-  Vitis 2023.2 introduced the Unified IDE, but the User Managed Mode (required for makefile-based projects) has incomplete debug configuration support
-  The classic Eclipse mode provides a mature, fully-functional debugging experience

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Vitis 2023.2, 2023.2, 2024.1, or 2024.2 installed
-  Hardware design file (.xsa) in project directory
-  JTAG and UART cables connected to target board

WSL2 Users: One-Time xsdb Fix
-----------------------------

.. important::

   On WSL2, xsdb crashes with "Segmentation fault" due to rlwrap incompatibility. Apply this fix once per machine.


**If you've already applied this fix previously, skip this step.**

**Automated Installation (Recommended):**

For default Vitis installation (``/xilinx/<version>/Vitis``):

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh

For custom Vitis installation location:

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /custom/path/to/Vitis/bin

**Examples:**

::

   # Vitis 2024.2 at default location
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /xilinx/2024.2/Vitis/bin

   # Vitis 2023.2 at custom location
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2023.2/bin

   # Vitis on Windows drive (WSL)
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /mnt/c/Xilinx/Vitis/2024.1/bin

**Note:** This is a system-wide fix, only needs to be done once per machine.

Per-Project Setup (First Time Only)
-----------------------------------

Step 1: Build Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   For optimal debugging, always build with ``DEBUG=1``. This enables proper debug symbols and correct source path mapping.


::

   source /path/to/xilinx/Vitis/2023.2/settings64.sh
   cd /path/to/no-OS/projects/your_project
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

**What happens:**

-  Build runs with debug optimization (``‑O0``, no optimization)
-  Full debug symbols added (``‑g3``)
-  Source path mapping configured
-  First build automatically runs ``make project`` (generates BSP and FSBL)
-  Creates ``build/your_project.elf`` with debug symbols

Step 2: Open Vitis Classic Eclipse IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   make sdkopen

**What happens:**

-  The command automatically detects Vitis 2023.2-2024.x
-  Launches the **Classic Eclipse IDE** (not the Unified IDE)
-  Workspace opens at ``build/`` directory
-  Standard Eclipse workspace with ``.metadata/`` directory

Step 3: Create and Configure Debug (Manual)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Classic Eclipse requires manual debug configuration. This is a one-time setup per project.


**A. Open Debug Configurations Dialog:**

In the Vitis IDE menu bar:

-  Go to **Run** → **Debug Configurations...**
-  Or click the **Debug** toolbar button dropdown → **Debug Configurations...**

The "Debug Configurations" dialog will open.

**B. Create New Configuration:**

#. In the left panel, expand **"Single Application Debug"**
#. Click the **"New Configuration"** button (first icon in the toolbar - looks like a document with a star/plus)
#. A new configuration will be created (e.g., ``Debugger_-Default``)
#. You can rename it if desired (e.g., ``adrv904x-debug``)

**C. Configure Main Tab:**

The **"Main"** tab should be selected by default.

**Debug Type:**

-  Select **"Standalone Application Debug"** from the dropdown
-  (Not "Attach to running target" - we want to reset and program the system)

**Connection:**

-  Leave as **"Local"** (debugging via local JTAG connection)

**D. Configure Target Setup Tab:**

Click the **"Target Setup"** tab at the top.

**Hardware Platform:**

-  Should auto-populate with the path to your ``.xsa`` file
-  If empty, click **"Browse..."** and select ``system_top.xsa`` from your project root

**Bitstream File:**

-  Auto-populated from the XSA file
-  Path will be similar to: ``.../projects/your_project/system_top.bit``

**FSBL Configuration** (ZynqMP/Zynq-7000 only):

Check these boxes:

-  ☑ **Use FSBL flow for initialization**
-  ☑ **Reset entire system**
-  ☑ **Program FPGA**
-  ☑ **Initialize using FSBL**

**FSBL File:**

Browse to or enter the FSBL path:

::

   build/tmp/output/hw0/export/hw0/sw/hw0/boot/fsbl.elf

.. note::

   For MicroBlaze: Uncheck "Use FSBL flow for initialization" - MicroBlaze doesn't use FSBL


**Summary Panel:**

After configuration, the Summary panel on the right shows the debug sequence:

#. Reset system and clear FPGA
#. Program FPGA with bitstream
#. Initialize PS using FSBL
#. Load application and suspend processors

**E. Configure Application Tab:**

Click the **"Application"** tab at the top.

**Processor Selection:**

The IDE shows a table with available processors. Check the box next to your target processor:

-  **ZynqMP**: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` (or ``psu_cortexr5_0`` for R5)
-  **Zynq-7000**: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  **MicroBlaze**: ``microblaze_0``
-  **Versal**: ``psv_cortexa72_0``

**Project and Application:**

The IDE typically auto-populates these fields:

-  **Project**: Should show your project name (e.g., ``adrv904x``)
-  **Application**: Should point to your ELF file: ``build/your_project.elf``

.. tip::

   If the Application field is empty, click "Search..." and browse to ``build/your_project.elf``\


**Stop at 'main':**

-  Check this box to have the debugger stop at the ``main()`` function (recommended)

**F. Save and Apply:**

#. Click **"Apply"** to save the configuration
#. Click **"Debug"** to start debugging immediately, or **"Close"** to save for later

The configuration is now saved and ready to use!

Debugging Your Project
----------------------

Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect JTAG cable to your board
-  Connect UART cable (for console output)
-  Power on the board

Start Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In Vitis Classic Eclipse IDE:**

#. Make sure you've built with ``make DEBUG=1``
#. Go to **Run** → **Debug Configurations...**
#. Select your debug configuration (e.g., "adrv904x-debug")
#. Click **"Debug"** button
#. The Debug perspective will open automatically

**What happens:**

#. Vitis connects to board via JTAG
#. Programs FPGA with bitstream
#. Runs FSBL to initialize processor (ZynqMP/Zynq only)
#. Loads your application ELF
#. Stops at entry point (usually ``main()``) - ready to debug!

**Debug Features:**

-  Set breakpoints (click left margin in code)
-  Step through code (F5=Step Into, F6=Step Over, F7=Step Return, F8=Resume)
-  Inspect variables, registers, call stack
-  Watch expressions
-  View memory and disassembly

Daily Development Workflow
--------------------------

After initial setup:

::

   # 1. Edit code

   # 2. Build with debug symbols
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

   # 3. Debug
   make sdkopen
   # In Vitis Eclipse: Run → Debug Configurations → Select your config → Debug

Architecture-Specific Notes
---------------------------

**ZynqMP (Cortex-A53/R5):**

-  Processor: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` or ``psu_cortexr5_0``
-  FSBL Required: Yes
-  FSBL Path: ``build/tmp/output/hw0/export/hw0/sw/hw0/boot/fsbl.elf``

**Zynq-7000 (Cortex-A9):**

-  Processor: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  FSBL Required: Yes
-  FSBL Path: Same as ZynqMP

**MicroBlaze:**

-  Processor: ``microblaze_0``
-  FSBL Required: No (soft processor)
-  In debug config: Uncheck "Use FSBL flow for initialization"

**Versal (Cortex-A72):**

-  Processor: ``psv_cortexa72_0``
-  Uses PLM (Platform Loader Manager) instead of FSBL

Troubleshooting
---------------

**"Segmentation fault" when debugging:**

-  Solution: Install xsdb WSL2 fix (see above)

**Stepping doesn't work / variables optimized out:**

-  Solution: Rebuild with ``make clean && make DEBUG=1``

**IDE doesn't open or wrong IDE opens:**

-  Verify you're using Vitis 2023.2-2024.x
-  The Classic Eclipse IDE should open (not the Unified IDE)
-  If Unified IDE opens, the version detection may be incorrect

      Assuming you've installed STM32CubeMX at C:\\stm32cubemx and STM32CubeIDE to C:\\stm32cubeide, run these commands prior to building to let the build system know where they are installed:

      ::

         $ export STM32CUBEMX=/c/stm32cubemx
         $ export STM32CUBEIDE=/c/stm32cubeide

      Make sure you have the .ioc file in the project directory, then type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=stm32

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.



The build process creates a **build** directory in the project folder:

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive `no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects:

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

Fore more details about the available make rules, :doc:`check out this page </wiki-migration/resources/no-os/make>`.

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

::

    * It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
    * You must have all updates installed in WSL.
        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

::

    * You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
    * You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers: 

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

::

    * Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

::

    * If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive `no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects: 

.. collapsible:: Linux (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Make sure the GNU Make version you are using is >= 4.2.


   

.. collapsible:: Intel (Click to expand)

   Assuming the SDK is installed at this path:

      ::

         /path/to/intel
         └── intelFPGA
             └── 18.1

      Run:

      ::

         $ source no-OS/tools/scripts/platform/intel/environment.sh /path/to/intel/intelFPGA 18.1





   .. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

      Assuming the Vitis 2022.2 is installed at this path:

      ::

         $ source /path/to/xilinx/Vitis/2022.2/settings64.sh





   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      -  Install `stm32cubeide <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html>`_ (latest version) to default location ``/opt/stm32cubeide``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEIDE=/path/to/your/stm32cubeide`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install `stm32cubemx <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html>`_ version 6.5.0 to default location ``/opt/stm32cubemx``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEMX=/path/to/your/stm32cubemx`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install python (if not already present) and make sure python command executes Python3 (not Python2). This can be easily achieved by running the following command ``sudo apt install python-is-python3``.





   .. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

      -  Install the `Maxim Micros SDK <https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/software-description.html/swpart=SFW0018720A>`_.
      -  Set the MAXIM_LIBRARIES environment variable to the MaximSDK/Libraries path (the default should be ~/MaximSDK/Libraries).

      Assuming you've installed STM32CubeMX at C:\\stm32cubemx and STM32CubeIDE to C:\\stm32cubeide, run these commands prior to building to let the build system know where they are installed:

      ::

         $ export STM32CUBEMX=/c/stm32cubemx
         $ export STM32CUBEIDE=/c/stm32cubeide

      Make sure you have the .ioc file in the project directory, then type:

   ├── project_name.elf
   └── tmp

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

Fore more details about the available make rules, :doc:`check out this page </wiki-migration/resources/no-os/make>`.

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

::

    * It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
    * You must have all updates installed in WSL.
        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

::

    * You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
    * You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers:

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

::

    * Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

::

    * To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

::

    * If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

No-OS Build Guide
=================

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive `no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler, linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS projects: 

.. collapsible:: Linux (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Make sure the GNU Make version you are using is >= 4.2.


   

.. collapsible:: Intel (Click to expand)

   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      -  Install `stm32cubeide <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html>`_ (latest version) to default location ``/opt/stm32cubeide``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEIDE=/path/to/your/stm32cubeide`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install `stm32cubemx <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html>`_ version 6.5.0 to default location ``/opt/stm32cubemx``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEMX=/path/to/your/stm32cubemx`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install python (if not already present) and make sure python command executes Python3 (not Python2). This can be easily achieved by running the following command ``sudo apt install python-is-python3``.





   .. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

      -  Install the `Maxim Micros SDK <https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/software-description.html/swpart=SFW0018720A>`_.
      -  Set the MAXIM_LIBRARIES environment variable to the MaximSDK/Libraries path (the default should be ~/MaximSDK/Libraries).

      .. important::

         Make sure that the virtual environment is activated (environment name enclosed in parenthesis appears in the git terminal) and that the packages from prerequisites were installed.


      To build a project, type:

      ::

         make PLATFORM=mbed TARGET_BOARD=...

      The ``TARGET_BOARD`` specifies the board for which the project is built. If not specified, it defaults to ``SDP-K1``.

      ::

         $ export PLATFORM=aducm3029
         $ make





   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      Assuming you've installed STM32CubeMX at C:\\stm32cubemx and STM32CubeIDE to C:\\stm32cubeide, run these commands prior to building to let the build system know where they are installed:

      ::

         $ export STM32CUBEMX=/c/stm32cubemx
         $ export STM32CUBEIDE=/c/stm32cubeide

      Make sure you have the .ioc file in the project directory, then type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=stm32

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.



The build process creates a **build** directory in the project folder:

::

   build
   ├── app
   ├── bsp
   ├── obj
   ├── project_name.elf
   └── tmp

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen



.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.





.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start \`hw_server\`. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the \`hw_server\` port should be 3121.



Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

Fore more details about the available make rules, :doc:`check out this page </wiki-migration/resources/no-os/make>`.

++++ Running/Debugging in WSL \|

If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

.. important::

   no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*\ :math:`::jtagtarget*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with \"`\ params(filter)\\". available targets:$target_list""...


If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps must be followed:

::

    * It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
    * You must have all updates installed in WSL.
        To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

::

   :~$ uname -a
   Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

::

    * You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
    * You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers:

::

   :~$ sudo apt upgrade
   :~$ sudo apt update
   :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

If the last command does not work, try:

::

   :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip


   | tail -n1` 20

If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial Converter.

To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the following:

::

    * Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

::

   C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list
   BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not attached to a WSL instance.

In WSL enter the following command:

::

   :~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we will only see roots hubs.

::

    * To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in WSL.

::

   > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached in WSL.

In WSL if you run: **lsusb** we have:

::

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
   Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\

If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer appear in the list of devices.

::

    * If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

::

   > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

++++ Debugging with Vitis 2025.1 (Unified IDE) \|

.. important::

   Starting with Vitis 2023.2, Xilinx transitioned from Eclipse to a Unified IDE architecture. Vitis 2025.1 now features automatic debug configuration - no manual setup required!


**Key Changes in Vitis 2025.1:**

-  Debug configuration **automatically generated** by build system
-  Bitstream and initialization files **auto-extracted** from XSA
-  Architecture-specific settings **auto-configured** (ZynqMP, Zynq, MicroBlaze, Versal)
-  Just click **FLOW → Debug** to start debugging!

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Vitis 2025.1 installed
-  Hardware design file (.xsa) in project directory
-  JTAG and UART cables connected to target board

WSL2 Users: One-Time xsdb Fix
-----------------------------

.. important::

   On WSL2, xsdb crashes with "Segmentation fault" due to rlwrap incompatibility. Apply this fix once per machine.


**If you've already applied this fix previously, skip this step.**

**Automated Installation (Recommended):**

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh

**Manual Installation:**

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS

   # Backup original
   sudo cp /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb.original

   # Install fixed version
   sudo cp tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/xsdb-nowrap /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb
   sudo chmod +x /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/bin/xsdb

**Note:** This is a system-wide fix, only needs to be done once per machine.

Per-Project Setup (First Time Only)
-----------------------------------

Step 1: Build Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   For optimal debugging, always build with ``DEBUG=1``. This enables proper debug symbols and correct source path mapping.


::

   source /xilinx/2025.1/Vitis/settings64.sh
   cd /path/to/no-OS/projects/your_project
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

**What happens:**

-  Build runs with debug optimization (``‑O0``, no optimization)
-  Full debug symbols added (``‑g3``)
-  Source path mapping configured (``‑fdebug‑prefix‑map``)
-  First build automatically runs ``make project`` (generates BSP and FSBL)
-  Creates ``build/your_project.elf`` with debug symbols

.. tip::

   Without DEBUG=1, you'll experience:

   
   -  Code stepping doesn't work properly (optimized code)
   -  Variables optimized out and not visible
   -  Breakpoints may not hit expected lines
   


Step 2: Open Vitis IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   make sdkopen

**First time only:** When Vitis opens, you'll see "Update Workspace" dialog:

-  Message: "Vitis IDE cannot recognize the workspace version. Click 'Update' to initialize the workspace metadata."
-  Click **"Update"** button
-  This initializes the workspace (one-time setup)

**What happens automatically:**

-  Vitis opens at project root
-  Workspace metadata initialized
-  ``_ide/`` directory created
-  **Bitstream extracted** from XSA to ``_ide/system_top/system_top.bit``
-  **Initialization script extracted** (``psu_init.tcl`` or ``ps_init.tcl``)
-  **Debug configuration generated** (``_ide/launch.json``) with:

   -  Correct architecture settings (ZynqMP/Zynq/MicroBlaze/Versal)
   -  Hardware platform path (XSA file)
   -  FSBL configuration (if applicable)
   -  Application ELF path
   -  Target processor

.. note::

   No manual configuration needed! The debug configuration is ready to use immediately.


Step 3: Verify Configuration (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to verify or customize the auto-generated configuration:

#. In Vitis Explorer, expand ``_ide`` folder
#. Open ``launch.json`` to view the configuration
#. Configuration named ``<project_name>_app_hw_1`` is ready to use

The configuration is automatically regenerated each time you run ``make sdkopen``.

Debugging Your Project
----------------------

Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect JTAG cable to your board
-  Connect UART cable (for console output)
-  Power on the board

Start Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In Vitis IDE:**

#. Make sure you've built with ``make DEBUG=1``
#. Click **FLOW** panel (left side) → Click **"Debug"**
#. Debug session starts immediately!

.. warning::

   The Start Debugging (F5) button in the Debug panel does not currently work for Vitis 2025.1. Always use FLOW → Debug button.


**What happens:**

#. Vitis connects to board via JTAG
#. Programs FPGA with bitstream
#. Runs FSBL to initialize processor (ZynqMP/Zynq only)
#. Loads your application ELF
#. Stops at entry point - ready to debug!

**Debug Features:**

-  Set breakpoints (click left margin in code)
-  Step through code (F5=Step Into, F6=Step Over, F7=Step Return, F8=Resume)
-  Inspect variables, registers, call stack
-  Watch expressions
-  View memory and disassembly

Daily Development Workflow
--------------------------

After initial setup:

::

   # 1. Edit code

   # 2. Build with debug symbols
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

   # 3. Open Vitis and debug
   make sdkopen
   # Click FLOW → Debug → Debugging starts immediately!

.. tip::

   For production builds (no debugging), use ``make`` without ``DEBUG=1`` to get optimized code.


Architecture-Specific Notes
---------------------------

The build system automatically detects your hardware architecture and configures debug settings appropriately.

**ZynqMP (Cortex-A53/R5):**

-  Processor: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` or ``psu_cortexr5_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-zu``
-  FSBL Required: Yes (auto-configured)
-  Init Script: ``psu_init.tcl``

**Zynq-7000 (Cortex-A9):**

-  Processor: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-zynq``
-  FSBL Required: Yes (auto-configured)
-  Init Script: ``ps_init.tcl``

**MicroBlaze:**

-  Processor: ``microblaze_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-mb``
-  FSBL Required: No (auto-configured)

**Versal (Cortex-A72):**

-  Processor: ``psv_cortexa72_0``
-  Debug Type: ``baremetal-versal``
-  Uses PLM (Platform Loader Manager) instead of FSBL (auto-configured)

Troubleshooting
---------------

**"Segmentation fault" when debugging:**

-  Solution: Install xsdb WSL2 fix (see above)

**Debug doesn't start / "undefined" connection errors:**

-  Make sure you clicked "Update" on first workspace open
-  Verify ``_ide/launch.json`` exists
-  Try ``make sdkopen`` again to regenerate configuration

**Stepping doesn't work / variables optimized out:**

-  Solution: Rebuild with ``make clean && make DEBUG=1``

**For complete documentation, see:** :git-no-OS:`Xilinx Vitis Debugging Guide <doc/sphinx/source/build_guides/build_xilinx_vitis2025.rst>`

++++

++++ Debugging with Vitis 2023.2-2024.x (Classic Eclipse IDE) \|

.. important::

   The ``make sdkopen`` command automatically detects Vitis 2023.2-2024.x and launches the Classic Eclipse IDE (using the ``-classic`` flag) instead of the Unified IDE. This provides better stability and complete debug configuration support for makefile-based projects.


.. warning::

   Manual debug configuration required for Classic Eclipse mode. For automatic configuration, upgrade to Vitis 2025.1+.


**Why Classic Mode for Vitis 2023.2-2024.x?**

-  Vitis 2023.2 introduced the Unified IDE, but the User Managed Mode (required for makefile-based projects) has incomplete debug configuration support
-  The classic Eclipse mode provides a mature, fully-functional debugging experience

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Vitis 2023.2, 2023.2, 2024.1, or 2024.2 installed
-  Hardware design file (.xsa) in project directory
-  JTAG and UART cables connected to target board

WSL2 Users: One-Time xsdb Fix
-----------------------------

.. important::

   On WSL2, xsdb crashes with "Segmentation fault" due to rlwrap incompatibility. Apply this fix once per machine.


**If you've already applied this fix previously, skip this step.**

**Automated Installation (Recommended):**

For default Vitis installation (``/xilinx/<version>/Vitis``):

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh

For custom Vitis installation location:

::

   cd /path/to/no-OS
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /custom/path/to/Vitis/bin

**Examples:**

::

   # Vitis 2024.2 at default location
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /xilinx/2024.2/Vitis/bin

   # Vitis 2023.2 at custom location
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2023.2/bin

   # Vitis on Windows drive (WSL)
   sudo tools/scripts/platform/xilinx/install_xsdb_wsl2_fix.sh /mnt/c/Xilinx/Vitis/2024.1/bin

**Note:** This is a system-wide fix, only needs to be done once per machine.

Per-Project Setup (First Time Only)
-----------------------------------

Step 1: Build Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   For optimal debugging, always build with ``DEBUG=1``. This enables proper debug symbols and correct source path mapping.


::

   source /path/to/xilinx/Vitis/2023.2/settings64.sh
   cd /path/to/no-OS/projects/your_project
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

**What happens:**

-  Build runs with debug optimization (``‑O0``, no optimization)
-  Full debug symbols added (``‑g3``)
-  Source path mapping configured
-  First build automatically runs ``make project`` (generates BSP and FSBL)
-  Creates ``build/your_project.elf`` with debug symbols

Step 2: Open Vitis Classic Eclipse IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   make sdkopen

**What happens:**

-  The command automatically detects Vitis 2023.2-2024.x
-  Launches the **Classic Eclipse IDE** (not the Unified IDE)
-  Workspace opens at ``build/`` directory
-  Standard Eclipse workspace with ``.metadata/`` directory

Step 3: Create and Configure Debug (Manual)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Classic Eclipse requires manual debug configuration. This is a one-time setup per project.


**A. Open Debug Configurations Dialog:**

In the Vitis IDE menu bar:

-  Go to **Run** → **Debug Configurations...**
-  Or click the **Debug** toolbar button dropdown → **Debug Configurations...**

The "Debug Configurations" dialog will open.

**B. Create New Configuration:**

#. In the left panel, expand **"Single Application Debug"**
#. Click the **"New Configuration"** button (first icon in the toolbar - looks like a document with a star/plus)
#. A new configuration will be created (e.g., ``Debugger_-Default``)
#. You can rename it if desired (e.g., ``adrv904x-debug``)

**C. Configure Main Tab:**

The **"Main"** tab should be selected by default.

**Debug Type:**

-  Select **"Standalone Application Debug"** from the dropdown
-  (Not "Attach to running target" - we want to reset and program the system)

**Connection:**

-  Leave as **"Local"** (debugging via local JTAG connection)

**D. Configure Target Setup Tab:**

Click the **"Target Setup"** tab at the top.

**Hardware Platform:**

-  Should auto-populate with the path to your ``.xsa`` file
-  If empty, click **"Browse..."** and select ``system_top.xsa`` from your project root

**Bitstream File:**

-  Auto-populated from the XSA file
-  Path will be similar to: ``.../projects/your_project/system_top.bit``

**FSBL Configuration** (ZynqMP/Zynq-7000 only):

Check these boxes:

-  ☑ **Use FSBL flow for initialization**
-  ☑ **Reset entire system**
-  ☑ **Program FPGA**
-  ☑ **Initialize using FSBL**

**FSBL File:**

Browse to or enter the FSBL path:

::

   build/tmp/output/hw0/export/hw0/sw/hw0/boot/fsbl.elf

.. note::

   For MicroBlaze: Uncheck "Use FSBL flow for initialization" - MicroBlaze doesn't use FSBL


**Summary Panel:**

After configuration, the Summary panel on the right shows the debug sequence:

#. Reset system and clear FPGA
#. Program FPGA with bitstream
#. Initialize PS using FSBL
#. Load application and suspend processors

**E. Configure Application Tab:**

Click the **"Application"** tab at the top.

**Processor Selection:**

The IDE shows a table with available processors. Check the box next to your target processor:

-  **ZynqMP**: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` (or ``psu_cortexr5_0`` for R5)
-  **Zynq-7000**: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  **MicroBlaze**: ``microblaze_0``
-  **Versal**: ``psv_cortexa72_0``

**Project and Application:**

The IDE typically auto-populates these fields:

-  **Project**: Should show your project name (e.g., ``adrv904x``)
-  **Application**: Should point to your ELF file: ``build/your_project.elf``

.. tip::

   If the Application field is empty, click "Search..." and browse to ``build/your_project.elf``\


**Stop at 'main':**

-  Check this box to have the debugger stop at the ``main()`` function (recommended)

**F. Save and Apply:**

#. Click **"Apply"** to save the configuration
#. Click **"Debug"** to start debugging immediately, or **"Close"** to save for later

The configuration is now saved and ready to use!

Debugging Your Project
----------------------

Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect JTAG cable to your board
-  Connect UART cable (for console output)
-  Power on the board

Start Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In Vitis Classic Eclipse IDE:**

#. Make sure you've built with ``make DEBUG=1``
#. Go to **Run** → **Debug Configurations...**
#. Select your debug configuration (e.g., "adrv904x-debug")
#. Click **"Debug"** button
#. The Debug perspective will open automatically

**What happens:**

#. Vitis connects to board via JTAG
#. Programs FPGA with bitstream
#. Runs FSBL to initialize processor (ZynqMP/Zynq only)
#. Loads your application ELF
#. Stops at entry point (usually ``main()``) - ready to debug!

**Debug Features:**

-  Set breakpoints (click left margin in code)
-  Step through code (F5=Step Into, F6=Step Over, F7=Step Return, F8=Resume)
-  Inspect variables, registers, call stack
-  Watch expressions
-  View memory and disassembly

Daily Development Workflow
--------------------------

After initial setup:

::

   # 1. Edit code

   # 2. Build with debug symbols
   make clean
   make DEBUG=1

   # 3. Debug
   make sdkopen
   # In Vitis Eclipse: Run → Debug Configurations → Select your config → Debug

Architecture-Specific Notes
---------------------------

**ZynqMP (Cortex-A53/R5):**

-  Processor: ``psu_cortexa53_0`` or ``psu_cortexr5_0``
-  FSBL Required: Yes
-  FSBL Path: ``build/tmp/output/hw0/export/hw0/sw/hw0/boot/fsbl.elf``

**Zynq-7000 (Cortex-A9):**

-  Processor: ``ps7_cortexa9_0``
-  FSBL Required: Yes
-  FSBL Path: Same as ZynqMP

**MicroBlaze:**

-  Processor: ``microblaze_0``
-  FSBL Required: No (soft processor)
-  In debug config: Uncheck "Use FSBL flow for initialization"

**Versal (Cortex-A72):**

-  Processor: ``psv_cortexa72_0``
-  Uses PLM (Platform Loader Manager) instead of FSBL

Troubleshooting
---------------

**"Segmentation fault" when debugging:**

-  Solution: Install xsdb WSL2 fix (see above)

**Stepping doesn't work / variables optimized out:**

-  Solution: Rebuild with ``make clean && make DEBUG=1``

**IDE doesn't open or wrong IDE opens:**

-  Verify you're using Vitis 2023.2-2024.x
-  The Classic Eclipse IDE should open (not the Unified IDE)
-  If Unified IDE opens, the version detection may be incorrect

**For complete documentation, see:** :git-no-OS:`Xilinx Vitis Debugging Guide <doc/sphinx/source/build_guides/build_xilinx_vitis2025.rst>`

Example Project Execution
-------------------------

Basic Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Makefile Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to build the dummy project make sure you have the following configuration in the Makefile:

::

   # Select the example you want to enable by choosing y for enabling and n for disabling
   BASIC_EXAMPLE = y
   IIO_EXAMPLE = n

When running make command make sure to specify the platform you want to build the project for.

Project Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic project contains the generic HAL initialization of the used platform, together with the SPI, IRQ and UART driver configuration and initialization.

The SPI driver is used to communicate with the MAX11205PMB1 device, the IRQ driver is used to sample data when the conversion finishes (signaled by MISO line) and the UART driver is used to display on the host machine the measured data.

The dummy project contains the MAX11205 driver initialization:

.. code:: C

   struct no_os_irq_init_param max11205_gpio_irq_ip = {
       .platform_ops = GPIO_IRQ_OPS,
       .irq_ctrl_id = GPIO_CTRL_IRQ_ID,
       .extra = GPIO_IRQ_EXTRA,
   };

   struct no_os_spi_init_param max11205_spi_ip = {
       .device_id = SPI_DEVICE_ID,
       .max_speed_hz = SPI_BAUDRATE,
       .bit_order = NO_OS_SPI_BIT_ORDER_MSB_FIRST,
       .mode = NO_OS_SPI_MODE_2,
       .platform_ops = SPI_OPS,
       .chip_select = SPI_CS,
       .extra = SPI_EXTRA,
   };

   struct no_os_gpio_init_param max11205_gpio_rdy_ip = {
       .port = GPIO_SYNC_PORT_NUM,
       .number = GPIO_SYNC_PIN_NUM,
       .pull = NO_OS_PULL_NONE,
       .platform_ops = GPIO_OPS,
       .extra = GPIO_EXTRA,
   };

   struct max11205_init_param max11205_ip = {
       .gpio_rdy = &max11205_gpio_rdy_ip,
       .vref_mv = MAX11205_VREF_MV,
   };

   /* Initialize GPIO IRQ controller */
   ret = no_os_irq_ctrl_init(&max11205_gpio_irq_desc, &max11205_gpio_irq_ip);
   if (ret)
       return ret;

   /* Initialize device */
   max11205_ip.irq_ctrl = max11205_gpio_irq_desc;
   max11205_ip.spi_init = max11205_spi_ip;
   ret = max11205_init(&max11205_desc, max11205_ip);
   if (ret)
       return ret;

After the initialization phase, the device starts performing measurements which are accessed continuously in a while loop and are written on UART.

.. code:: C

   /* Continuously read data */
   while (1) {
       ret = max11205_get_data_raw(max11205_desc, &new_data_avail, &adc_data_raw);
       if (ret)
           return ret;
       /* Print data only if new data is available */
       if (new_data_avail) {
           pr_info("ADC raw data %d:\n", adc_data_raw);

           ret  = max11205_get_data_mv(max11205_desc, adc_data_raw, &adc_data_mv);
           if (ret)
               return ret;

           pr_info("ADC converted data %d [mV]:\n", adc_data_mv);
       }
   }

Project Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

UART Output for V_REF=3200 [mV], with V_IN=1300 [mV]:

::

   ADC raw data 13097:
   ADC converted data 1279 [mV]:

IIO Project
~~~~~~~~~~~

Makefile Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to build the IIO project make sure you have the following configuration in the Makefile:

::

   # Select the example you want to enable by choosing y for enabling and n for disabling
   BASIC_EXAMPLE = n
   IIO_EXAMPLE = y

When running make command make sure to specify the platform you want to build the project for.

Project Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project is actually a TINYIIOD demo for MAX11205PMB1 board. The project launches a TINYIIOD server on the board so that the user may connect to it via an IIO client. Using IIO-Oscilloscope, the user can view the measured data on a plot.

If you are not familiar with ADI IIO Application, please take a look at::doc:`IIO No-OS </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/no-os-software/iio>`

This IIO Project uses IIO-Oscilloscope as a client. If you are not familir with ADI IIO-Oscilloscope Client, please take a look at: :doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`

The No-OS IIO Application together with the No-OS IIO MAX11205 driver take care of all the backend logic needed to setup the IIO server. The user has to initialize the IIO device and call the IIO app as shown below. The read buffer is used for storing data which shall be available on the plot in the IIO Oscilloscope Client.

Project Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After flashing and running the application, IIO Oscilloscope can be used to obtain the desired data. Below you may find some snippets from IIO Oscilloscope, when running IIO Project:

Bellow you can see the Connection window for IIO Oscilloscope. The handshake is performed and the device is detected over UART. After pressing the **Connect** button we can see the device in the list, together with its channels and we can see the measured data.

.. important::

   Note that when running the project on Maxim platform, a baudrate of 57600 should be selected from the IIO Oscilloscope interface.
