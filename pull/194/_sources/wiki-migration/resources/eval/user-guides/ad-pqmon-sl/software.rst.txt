.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy12.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  The PQEvents indicator warns the user that a PQ event occurred. The events are saved in the log file if logging is active.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy12_1.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  If an event occurs during the session the PQEvents indicator will become active. The event can be found in the log file (in the rms tab only the PQ events data is logged into the file). The indicator remains on until the user clicks on it. This will reset the indicator. Even if the indicator is not reset any new event will be registered in the log file.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy13_5.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  Logging can be activated only when the measurement is not running. First the LOG button needs to be selected. A log directory needs to be specified after selecting the button highlighted in the following image.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy12_2.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  A folder where the data will be saved in csv format needs to be specified. The file is saved with the following name: "nameofactivewindow_date_time.csv" (e.g. rms_01-01-2024_11-00-00).

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy12_3.jpg

Harmonics tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The Harmonics tab can be activated by clicking on it and afterwards selecting the Run button.
-  To display the harmonics for different waveforms select the line from the table above the graphic.
-  The THD values are shown for each measurement after the THD label.
-  The PQEvents indicator warns the user that an event occurred. The events are saved in the log file if logging is active.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy13.jpg

   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  Logging can be activated only when the measurement is not running. First the LOG button needs to be selected. A log directory needs to be specified after selecting the button highlighted in the following image.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy13_2.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  A folder where the data will be saved in csv format needs to be specified. The file is saved with the following name: "nameofactivewindow_date_time.csv" (e.g. harmonics_01-01-2024_11-00-00).

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy13_3.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  After the folder is selected, the data will be recorded during a session. The session starts when the running button is activated and ends when it is stopped.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy13_4.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  If an event occurs during the session the PQEvents indicator will become active. The event can be found in the log file. The log file in the harmonic tab contains the data regarding the harmonics values and the PQ events intercalated with it at the time that the event occurred. The indicator remains on until the user clicks on it. This will reset the indicator. Even if the indicator is not reset any new PQ event will be registered in the log file.
-  A snapshot of the harmonics log file containing only harmonics data is presented in the following image.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/harmonics_tab_log.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

-  The log file can also be activated in the waveforms tab in the same manner explained in the rms or harmonics sections, but in this case the PQ events is not present. If PQ events need to be recorded, then the other two tabs (rms, harmonics) must be used. The data logged in this tab contains only the waveforms values.

.. note::

   More information about the Scopy PQMON addon can be consulted `here <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/scopy/plugins/pqm/index.html>`_

   
   The system comes pre-programmed with a firmware that works with the Scopy application, allowing complete system evaluation.
   
   Scopy will work only with the official :git-no-OS:`firmware releases <projects/eval-pqmon>`


Firmware Update
---------------

Firmware update using a prebuilt hex file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`PQMON hex file download <https://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/scopy/ad-pqmon-sl/eval-pqmon.hex>`_

Step 1 - :adi:`max32625pico` firmware update Download the :adi:`MAX32650FTHR` firmware image from `here <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images>`_

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy23.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 300px

Follow the procedure indicated `here <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images?tab=readme-ov-file>`_ to load the new firmware.

Step 2 – Connect the :adi:`max32625pico` to the :adi:`ad-pqmon-sl` board Connect the Cortex Debug Cable to the :adi:`max32625pico` with the connector key directed towards the outside of the board.

Connect the programmer to the board as shown in the following picture.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy24.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

Step 3 - Power up the board by connecting the USB type C cable.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy25.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

Step 4 - Flashing the firmware to the ad-pqmon-sl

If the :adi:`max32625pico` is not connected to the PC USB port connect it. The DAPLINK should appear as a storage device on the PC.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-pqmon-sl/scopy26.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 300px

Open the DAPLINK. Drag and drop the provided \*.hex file into DAPLINK. The firmware will be written on the target MCU.

Firmware update building the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preliminary requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The licensed software library that works in conjunction with the :adi:`ADE9430` IC can be obtained from `here <https://form.analog.com/form_pages/softwaremodules/SRF.aspx>`_.

After obtaining the libraries, the following files need to be added to the project:

pqlib_dir

::

   |   libadi_pqlib_cm4_gcc.a
    └───include
        |   ade9430.h
        |   adi_pqlib_debug.h
        |   adi_pqlib_error.h
        |   adi_pqlib_memory.h
        |   adi_pqlib_profile.h
        |   adi_pqlib_version.h
        |   adi_pqlib.h
        └───config
            └───adi_pqlib_cfg.h

It can be integrated into the project by defining the \`PQLIB_PATH\` to point to the \`pqlib_dir\` path.

Build and run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project is based on a :adi:`MAX32650` microcontroller. It can be built and run by running the following script:

.. code:: bash

   # remove build directory
   make reset
   # select platform
   export PLATFORM=maxim
   # select controller type
   export TARGET=max32650
   # build and flash the code
   make PQLIB_PATH=<path_to_library> run
