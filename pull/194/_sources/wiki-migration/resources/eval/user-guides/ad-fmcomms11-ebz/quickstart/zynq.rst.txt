-  Set the jumpers: The main one is: SW11 - Big Blue Switch in the middle, which controls the Boot Mode, it needs to be set: 1: Down, 2: Down, 3: Up, 4: Up, 5: Down. Refer to the image below.

   Even thought this is Linux, this is a persistent file systems. Care should be taken not to corrupt the file system -- please shut down things, don't just turn off the power switch. Depending on your monitor, the standard power off could be hiding. You can do this from the terminal as well with ``sudo shutdown -h now``
