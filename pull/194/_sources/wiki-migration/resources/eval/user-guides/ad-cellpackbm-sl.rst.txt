Key Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: indent

   
   **EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW 16-Channel Battery Cell Monitor**

   
   The EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW is a full-featured evaluation board for the ADBMS6830B, a 16-channel battery stack monitor for broad market applications. This board allows multiple boards to be linked through a single twisted pair wire interface (isoSPI) to monitor a long series of cells in a stack. It provides access to full channel monitoring to all cells going to battery pack either in the supply line or in the V+ to V- line. The evaluation board also features reversible isoSPI that can access either path to do measurement functions and serve as a redundant communication path.

   **EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC Battery Pack Monitor**

   
   The EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC battery pack monitoring evaluation board features the ADBMS2950B, a bidirectional current monitor, with 12 buffered high impedance voltage sense inputs, linked through a 2-wire isolated serial interface (isoSPI). This board also features reversible isoSPI, enabling a redundant communication path.
   
   The EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC board can be operated on the same isoSPI daisy-chain with other ADBMS2950B and ADBMS6830B devices.

   **EVAL-ADBMS6822 Dual isoSPI Adapter**

   
   The :adi:`EVAL-ADBMS6822` is a dual SPI to 2-wire isolated serial port interface (isoSPI) adapter featuring the ADBMS6822. This board allows multiple ADBMS68xx battery monitors through daisy-chain connections. The EVAL-ADBMS6822 evaluation board also features reversible isoSPI, which enables a redundant path to the peripheral units. The PCB components and DuraClik connectors are optimized for low electromagnetic interference (EMI) susceptibility and emissions.

   **EVAL-SDP-CK1Z (SDP-K1) Controller Board**

   
   The EVAL-SDP-CK1Z Controller Board provides a means of communicating with the PC from the other BMS boards in the Cellpack BMS System. The SDP-K1 provides USB connectivity through a USB 2.0 high speed connection to the computer, allowing users to evaluate components on this platform from a PC application. The SDP-K1 is based on an STM32F469NIH6 Arm® Cortex®-M4 microcontroller with the peripheral communication lines available to the daughter board(s) through a 120-pin small footprint connector and Arduino® Uno-compatible headers.
