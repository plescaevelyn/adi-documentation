SENSORS
~~~~~~~

For quick prototyping and development purposes, sensors are present onboard the
EV-COG-AGILE-900Z. The SHT31 temperature sensor is present on the
EV-COG-AGILE-900Z and can be used in user developed applications. A shunt jumper
should be inserted in P9 to power up the sensor. SHT31 communicates with the
ADuCM4050 through I2C0 lines.

SHUNT JUMPERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The on-board jumpers multiplex GPIO lines for various functionalities. The shunt
jumpers, or shunts, are 1.27 mm headers with shorted pins. By default, the shunt
jumpers are inserted in the positions listed in Table 5

Table 5 To change the jumper settings, remove the shunt jumper from the default
position and insert the jumper in the new position. The pin numbers are written
on the silk screen.

JH1
^^^

JH1 connects VDD_MCU with VDD_MCU_B line to pull up the I2C lines and power any
sensors connected via expansion connectors.

JH2
^^^

JH2 connects the power supply input to the regulator. The EV-COG-AGILE-900Z is
not powered if the shunts are not inserted at JH2.

JH3
^^^

JH3 is a 4-pin header. Pin 1 and Pin 2 are shorted by default and connect
VDD_MAIN to VDD_BOARD. Inserting shunts at Pin 3 and Pin 4 connects VDD_BOARD to
GND.

JH4
^^^

JH4 is a 6-pin header that determines whether the ADP5300 is bypassed. Inserting
shunts at Pin 1 and Pin 2 connects the output of the regulator to VDD_MAIN.
Shunts at Pin 3 and Pin 4 bypass the regulator and connect EXT_VDD_IN to
VDD_MAIN. Shunts at Pin 5 and Pin 6 bypass the regulator and connect VIN to
VDD_MAIN. The ADP5300 should never by bypassed when the EV-COG-AGILE-900Z is
powered through a USB supply.

JH5
^^^

JH5 is a 4-pin header that enables the Mbed chip. Shunts a Pin 1 and Pin 2
connect VDD_MAIN to VDD_MBED, which powers the Mbed chip.

JH6
^^^

Shunts at Pin 1 and Pin 2 route the Mbed chip signals to the ADuCM4050. If the
shunts are removed, the Mbed chip routes the signals to P26. Connecting a 10-pin
cable between P26 on EV-COG-AGILE-900Z and a supported external board allows the
Mbed chip on the EV-COG-AGILE-900Z to program the external board.

JH9
^^^

Shunts at Pin 1 and Pin 2 power VDD_RF_H to VDD_MAIN. Removing the shunts
disables the power supply to the ADF7030-1.

SOLDER JUMPERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solder jumpers are shorted by soldering required points. There are five solder
jumpers on the board. Four of the solder jumpers are located on the bottom side
of the EV-COG-AGILE-900Z. To change a solder jumper using a hot soldering iron,
melt a blob of solder and move the jumper to the new position.

Table 6

JP1
^^^

JP1 determines the routing of the GPIO28 and GPIO29 lines. By soldering Pin 1
and Pin 2, the GPIO28 and GPIO29 lines are routed to A_GPIO28 on the C1
expansion connector. By soldering Pin 2 and Pin 3, the GPIO28 and GPIO29 lines
are routed to A_GPIO29 on P3.

JP2
^^^

JP2 determines the routing of the GPIO43 and GPIO27 lines. By soldering Pin 1
and Pin 2, the GPIO43 and GPIO27 lines are routed to A_GPIO43 on P2. By
soldering Pin 2 and Pin 3, the GPIO43 and GPIO27 lines are routed to A_GPIO27 on
P7.

JP4
^^^

JP4 routes the INT_WAKE2 line. By soldering Pin 1 and Pin 2, the INT_WAKE2 line
is routed to the EXT_INT_WAKE2 line on the C1 expansion connector.

JP5
^^^

JP5 routes the SPI1_CS3 line. By soldering Pin 1 and Pin 2, the SPI1_CS3 line is
routed to the EXT_SPI1_CS3 line on the C1 expansion connector.

JP6
^^^

JP6 determines the routing of the SWO line. By soldering Pin 1 and Pin 2, the
SWO line is routed to the UART0_TXD line. By soldering Pin 2 and Pin 3, the SWO
line is routed to the SPI1_CS0 line.

Other shunts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

P2
^^

By default, shunts are inserted at Pin 1 and Pin 2. P2 connects the on-board
accelerometer or the RTC sensorstrobe line to a GPIO depending on shunt
position.

P3
^^

P3 provides an option to mux the GPIO14 line for different functionalities. By
default, shunts are inserted at Pin 1 and Pin 2 and Pin 7 and Pin 8. To support
add on boards, the default position of P3 needs to be changed accordingly. For
the EV-GEAR-EINK1Z add-on board, connect Pin 3 and Pin 4 instead of Pin 1 and
Pin 2.

P4
^^

P4 enables the GPIO34 line to be used for different functionalities. By default,
shunts are inserted at Pin 1 and Pin 2.

P7
^^

By default, shunts are inserted at Pin 1 and Pin 2. P7 connects one of two GPIOs
(A_GPIO27 or GPIO12) to a GPIO mux depending on shunt position.

P8
^^

P8 is a UART header that provides an option to route the UART lines to different
interfaces. The shunts are placed at Pin 1 and Pin 2 and Pin 7 and Pin 9 by
default, which routes the UART lines from the Mbed chip to the UART lines to the
ADuCM4050.

P9
^^

To power up the SHT31 temperature sensor, shunts must be inserted at P9.

CURRENT MEASURING TEST POINTS
-----------------------------

The EV-COG-AGILE-900Z enables a user to measure and profile the current
consumption throughout board. The EV-COG-AGILE-900Z also enables the isolation
of current consumption hotspots. The current measuring test points shown in
Table 1 can be used with a digital multimeter to profile the current
consumption. These test points measure the board level current, ADuCM4050
current, and ADF7030-1 radio frequency (RF) current.
