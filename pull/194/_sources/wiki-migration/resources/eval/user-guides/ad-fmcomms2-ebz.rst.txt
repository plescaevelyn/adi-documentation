AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ User Guide
==========================

The :adi:`AD-FMComms2-EBZ` is an FMC board for the :adi:`AD9361` (:adi:`design package <en/license/licensing-agreement/ad9361.html>`), a highly integrated RF Agile Transceiver™. While the complete chip level design package can be found on the :adi:`the ADI web site <ad9361_design_files>`. Information on the card, and how to use it, the design package that surrounds it, and the software which can make it work, can be found here.

The purpose of the AD-FMComms2-EBZ is to provide an RF platform which shows maximum performance of the AD9361. It’s expected that the RF performance of this platform can meet the datasheet specifications without issues at 2.4 GHz, and not much anywhere else. This is due to the external Johanson Technology's `2450BL15B050E <https://www.johansontechnology.com/datasheets/2450BL15B050/2450BL15B050.pdf>`_ 2.45 GHz Balun that is on the board. This balun is rated for a operating frequency of 2400~2500 MHz.

This platform is primarily for hardware / RF investigation and bring up of various waveforms from a RF team before their custom hardware is complete, where they want to see waveforms at their frequency of interest, and are not afraid of changing out the balun if necessary. (Have a look in the :doc:`Configuration </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz/hardware/configuration_options>` sections).

The AD-FMComms2-EBZ board is very similar to the `ad-fmcomms3-ebz <https://wiki.analog.com/ad-fmcomms3-ebz>`_ board with only one exception, the RX/TX RF differential to single ended balun/transformer. The AD-FMComms3-EBZ is more targetted for wider tuning range applications, that is why we use the `TCM1-63AX+ <http://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/TCM1-63AX+.pdf>`_ from mini Circuits as the RF transformer of choice. We affectionately call the FMCOMMS3-EBZ the "Software Engineers" platform, and the FMCOMMS2-EBZ, the "RF Engineers" platform to denote the difference.
