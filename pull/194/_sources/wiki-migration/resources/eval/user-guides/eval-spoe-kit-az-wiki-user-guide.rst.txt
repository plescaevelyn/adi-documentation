EVAL-SPoE-KIT-AZ Evaluation Kit User Guide
==========================================

General Description
-------------------

The EVAL-SPoE-KIT-AZ is an IEEE 802.3cg single-pair, power over Ethernet (SPoE)
evaluation kit. The kit features the LTC4296-1, 5-Port SPoE power sourcing
equipment (PSE) controller, and the LTC9111, SPoE powered device (PD) for
evaluation of IEEE 802.3cg Class 10 through 15 SPoE power. The ADIN1100,
10BASE-T1L PHY provides the Ethernet data in the system.

Power + Data Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-SPoE-KIT-AZ provides evaluation of 10BASE-T1L data and SPoE power over
a single twisted pair Ethernet (SPE) cable. Connect the EVAL-LTC9111-AZ to the
EVAL-LTC4296-1-KIT-AZ with the provided SPE cable. Connect a 10BASE-T compatible
data source with a CATV Ethernet cable to the EVAL-LTC4296-1-KIT-AZ. Connect a
10BASE-T compatible end device with a CATV Ethernet cable to the
EVAL-LTC9111-AZ. (Note the end device will need power from an auxiliary source.)

EVAL-LTC4296-1-KIT-AZ Setup
---------------------------

The EVAL-LTC4296-1-KIT-AZ is comprised of the EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ PSE motherboard,
EVAL-LTC4296-1-RC-AZ microcontroller rider card, and a micro-B USB cable. The
LTC4296-1 GUI communicates with the EVAL-LTC4296-1-KIT-AZ for user interaction.

Rider Card Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Align the EVAL-LTC4296-1-RC-AZ rider card male headers with the female headers
on the EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ motherboard labeled for the µC RIDER CARD. Insert the
card to where the headers are flush. Before proceeding, verify no pins are
sticking out indicating a misalignment. Powering the motherboard with a
misaligned card can cause damage to the system.

Shield Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ PSE motherboard can accept up to 5 media converter shields
at locations Port 0 through 4. The sense resistors for each port have been
pre-selected for evaluation of specific maximum classes with respect to the
power supply voltage.

The EVAL-10BT1L-MCS-AZ is a 10BASE-TX to 10BASE-T1L media converter shield with
a power coupling network suited for Class 10 through 14 power levels. On the
default configured motherboard, the EVAL-10BT1L-MCS-AZ should be inserted at
Port 0, Port 1, Port 2, or Port 4. These positions are shown in red in the
picture below. See Table 1 and Figure 6.

The EVAL-10BT1L-MCS-BZ is a 10BASE-TX to 10BASE-T1L media converter shield with
a power coupling network suited for the Class 15 power level. On the default
configured motherboard, the EVAL-10BT1L-MCS-BZ should be inserted at Port 3
only. This position is shown in orange in the picture below. See Table 1 and
Figure 6.

When inserting a shield on to the motherboard, align the shield’s two short male
headers with the two short female headers at a port on the motherboard. The
longer header will naturally align. Note, the last two pins of the longer header
on the mother board are reserved for future use and will not have pins inserted
in them. Insert the shield to where the headers are flush. Before proceeding,
verify no pins are sticking out indicating a misalignment. Powering the
motherboard with a misaligned shield can cause damage to the system.

Power Supply
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Before turning on the power supply, verify all shields and rider card are
properly aligned with their respective headers on the motherboard and the
connector pins are fully inserted.

Connect a bench power supply across the VIN (+) and GND (-) banana terminals on
the EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ motherboard. The voltage of the power supply sets the SPoE
voltage. For evaluation of Class 10 through 12, set the nominal voltage to 24V;
for evaluation of Class 13 through 15 set the nominal voltage to 52V. Set the
current limit of the power supply higher than the current limit of the port
under test, or the sum of the current limits for multiple port evaluation.

The EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ motherboard has an onboard stepdown DC/DC converter that
generates 3.3V to power the rider card and the shield cards.

GUI Setup
~~~~~~~~~

The LTC4296-1 Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides the user with basic status
and configuration of the PSE ports. Use the micro-B USB cable to connect a PC to
the powered EVAL-LTC4296-1-KIT-AZ at the EVAL-LTC4296-1-RC-AZ rider card
micro-USB female connector. Open the LTC4296-1 GUI and the condensed GUI display
will open if successful. If an error occurs when opening the GUI, verify the
EVAL-LTC4296-1-KIT-AZ is powered, push the reset button on the
EVAL-LTC4296-1-RC-AZ rider card and re-launch the LTC4296-1 GUI.

On the condensed GUI, click on Expand Details in each column for the full GUI
display. In the Global Column, select in the Demo Board drop down menu
EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ to automatically configure each port maximum Class and Type,
R_hsns and R_lsns sense resistor values, and MFVS Threshold to match the default
settings on the EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ motherboard. The ports will start in a
Disabled state. To enable a port, select Power Up in the port’s Classification
(SCCP) section.

EVAL-LTC9111-AZ Setup
---------------------

The EVAL-LTC9111-AZ is an 802.3cg PD motherboard use for evaluating the LTC9111.

   \ *Figure 9. EVAL-LTC9111-AZ.*\

Shield Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-LTC9111-AZ PD motherboard can accept one media converter shield. For
Class 10 through 14 evaluations, install the EVAL-10BT1L-MCS-AZ. For Class 15
evaluation, install the EVAL-10BT1L-MCS-BZ.

When inserting a shield on to the motherboard, align the shield’s two short male
headers with the two short female headers at a port on the motherboard. The
longer header will naturally align. Note, the last two pins of the longer header
on the mother board are reserved for future use and will not have pins inserted
in them. Insert the shield until the headers are flush with each other. Before
proceeding, verify no pins are sticking out indicating a misalignment. Powering
the motherboard with a misaligned shield can cause damage to the system.

Onboard 3.3V
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-LTC9111-AZ PD motherboard has an onboard buck converter that steps the
SPoE voltage down to 3.3V. This 3.3V is used to power up the media converter
shield. Additional load may be connected to the 3.3V output.
