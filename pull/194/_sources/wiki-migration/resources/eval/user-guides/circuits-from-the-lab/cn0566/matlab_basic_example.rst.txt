The article will discuss operating the ADALM-Phaser (Phaser) platform with
MATLAB through use of the RF and Microwave Toolbox from Analog Devices (RFuW
Toolbox). The RFuW Toolbox provides interface system objects for control of
Phaser including examples and documentation in one convenient package.

Required Components
===================

-  First make sure you have ADALM-Phaser running with ADALM-Pluto attached. This process is covered in the article :doc:`EVAL-CN0566-RPIZ Overview </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0566/overview_setup>`.
-  Next from MATLAB install the `RF and Microwave Toolbox detailed on github <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/RFMicrowaveToolbox/main/install/>`_
-  Finally from MATLAB install `Transceiver Toolbox <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/TransceiverToolbox/master/install/>`_ which will control Pluto.

Verify Connectivity
===================

With Phaser connected to your local network or directly to your host machine
with MATLAB installed, create an instance of the adi.Phaser class from the
command prompt with the IP address of the Raspberry Pi.

.. code:: matlab

   bf = adi.Phaser;
   bf.uri = 'ip:phaser';
   bf()

This will connect and configure Phaser with a default set of parameters. If you
receive a connectivity error verify the Raspberry Pi is powered up and you can
at least ping the device. If you are having issues reach out to our support
forums on EngineerZone.

Next verify connectivity to Pluto with a similar method. Create and instance of
the adi.AD9361.Rx class and run the operator method as so:

.. code:: matlab

   sdr = adi.AD9361.Rx
   sdr.uri = 'ip:pluto';
   data = sdr();

Like the Phaser system object this operation should not generate any errors. The *data* vector should contain non-zero data.

Running an Example
==================

Now that we can communicate with the boards, we can run a basic example. With
RFuW Toolbox installed a number of examples are provided with it and place on
path. First make sure that the HB100 included with the Phaser kit is place
in-front of Phaser itself and turned on. Next, open the basic RX only example by
running the following on the MATLAB prompt:

::

   edit phaser_simple.m

This will launch the script containing the basic RX example. May any
modifications to the URIs if necessary to reflect your system:

Once updated run the script by pressing play:

This will produce a plot like the one below:
