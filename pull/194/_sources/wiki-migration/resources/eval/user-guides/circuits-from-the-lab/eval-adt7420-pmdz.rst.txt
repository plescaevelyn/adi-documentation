EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ Digital Temperature PMOD User Guide
=====================================================

The :adi:`ADT7420` is a high accuracy digital temperature sensor offering breakthrough performance over a wide industrial range. It contains an internal band gap reference, a temperature sensor, and a 16-bit ADC to monitor and digitize the temperature to 0.0078°C resolution. By default, the ADC resolution is set to 13 bits (0.0625°C). The ADC resolution is a user-programmable and can be changed through the serial interface.

The ADT7420 is guaranteed to operate over supply voltages from 2.7 V to 5.5 V. Operating at 3.3 V, the average supply current is typically 210 μA. This device also has a shutdown mode that powers down the device and offers a shutdown current of typically 2.0 μA at 3.3 V. The ADT7420 is rated for operation over the −40°C to +150°C temperature range.

Pin A0 and Pin A1 are available for address selection, giving the ADT7420 four possible I2C addresses. The CT pin is an open-drain output that becomes active when the temperature exceeds a programmable critical temperature limit. The INT pin is also an open-drain output that becomes active when the temperature exceeds a programmable limit. The INT pin and CT pin can operate in comparator and interrupt event modes.

Hardware
--------

This PMOD board is small in size with dimensions approximately 1 inch in width by 1 inch in length.

Power Supply Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ, the 3.3 V power comes directly from the host board it is connected to. The power from the host is generally capable of providing up to 100 mA at 3.3 V, but for complete PMOD power specifications, please `click here <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_.

The fastest way to tell if the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ board is powered is by seeing if the on-board LED is illuminated. The LED can be found here on the board.


|image1|

Digital Interface (PMOD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMOD interface is a series of standardized digital interfaces for various digital communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, and UART. These interface types were standardized by Digilent, which is now a division of National Instruments. Complete details on the PMOD specification can be found `here <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_.

The specific interface used for the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ boards is the extended I2C. In general ADI has adopted the extended I2C connector for all PMOD devices which have an I2C interface. It provides flexibility to add/daisy chain multiple I2C devices onto the same bus.

Jumper Configuration and Solder Links
-------------------------------------

The EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ has some optional modes of operation to increase flexibility when using multiple EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ boards in a single system and to help alert the Over/Under/Critical temperature readings. Each configuration is explained below.

ADT7420 I2C Address Selection Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADT7420 can have up to 4 unique I2C device addresses, depending on the logic level of Pins A1 and A0. The default configuration for the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ is for A1 and A0 to be tied low, so the default I2C address is 0x48.

| |image2|
| If you decide to change the I2C address, then you need to switch the position of the JP1 and JP2 solder links following the settings in the table below.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+
| JP1 Solder link Position | JP2 Solder link Position | A1 Logic Level | A0 Logic Level | I2C Device Address(Hex) |
+==========================+==========================+================+================+=========================+
| Pins 2 & 3 Shorted       | Pins 2 & 3 Shorted       | Low            | Low            | 0x48                    |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+
| Pins 2 & 3 Shorted       | Pins 1 & 2 Shorted       | Low            | High           | 0x49                    |

| Pins 1 & 2 Shorted       | Pins 2 & 3 Shorted       | High           | Low            | 0x4A                    |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+
| Pins 1 & 2 Shorted       | Pins 1 & 2 Shorted       | High           | High           | 0x4B                    |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+----------------+----------------+-------------------------+

ADT7420 Over/Under/Critical Temperature Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADT7420 has the capability of monitoring temperature and alerting users of Over/Under temperature conditions, as well as Critical temperature events. Access to these pins and functions are provided via the INT and CT connections on the board.

| |image3|
| The temperatures are software-configurable, and all you need to do is monitor the INT (for Over/Under temp conditions) or CT (for Critical temp events) with respect to GND.

Device Driver Support
---------------------

There are two device driver solutions that are provided for controlling the **EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ**:

-  **ADT7420 no-OS Driver**

   -  The MAX32655FTHR example application uses the :doc:`ADT7420 no-OS drivers </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/uc-drivers/adt7420>` and emulates the Linux IIO framework through the :git-libtinyiiod>`__. This driver is used in bare-metal applications, typically running on low-power, embedded microcontrollers. The application communicates with the host computer via the serial backend, over a USB-UART physical connection. This facilitates rapid application development on a host computer, independent from embedded code development.

-  **ADT7420 Linux Driver**

   -  The `ADT7420 Linux driver <https::`tinyiiod daemon library </git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/hwmon/adt7x10.c>` is used in applications running the Linux operating system, typically on larger processors and SoC devices.

      -  The ADT7420 Linux driver uses the Industrial Input/Output (IIO) framework, greatly simplifying the development of application code via the cross-platform Libiio library, which is written in C and includes bindings for Python, MATLAB, C#, and other languages. Application code can run directly on the platform board, communicating with the device over the local backend, or from a remote host over the network or USB backends.

System Setup Using ADICUP3029

   {{ :resources:eval:user-guides:circuits-from-the-lab:adt7420:2.png?nolink&500 |}}

Application Software (All Platforms)
------------------------------------

Hardware Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Libiio is a library used for interfacing with IIO devices and is required to be installed on your computer.

.. admonition:: Download
   :class: download

   Download and install the latest :git-libiio:`Libiio package <releases>` on your machine.


To be able to connect your device, the software must be able to create a context. The context creation in the software depends on the backend used to connect to the device as well as the platform where the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ is attached. Two platforms are currently supported for the ADT7420: Raspberry Pi using the ADI Kuiper Linux and the ADICUP3029 running the no-OS ADT7420 demo project. The user needs to supply a **URI**, which will be used in the context creation.

The :doc:`iio_info </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/iio_info>` command is a part of the libIIO package that reports all IIO attributes.

Upon installation, simply enter the command on the terminal command line to access it.

For RPI Direct Local Access:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   iio_info

For Windows machine connected to Raspberry Pi:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   iio_info -u ip:<ip address of your ip>

Example:

-  If your Raspberry Pi has the IP address **192.168.1.7**, you have to use *iio_info -u ip::192.168.1.7* as your URI.

.. note::

   Do note that the Windows machine and the RPI board should be connected to the same network in order for the machine to detect the device.


For Windows machine connected to ADICUP3029:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   iio_info -u serial:<serial port>

Examples:

-  In a Windows machine, you can check the port of your ADICUP3029 via Device Manager in the Ports (COM & LPT) section. If your device is in COM4, you have to use *iio_info -u serial:COM4* as your URI.
-  In a Unix-based machine, you will see it under the /dev/ directory in this format "ttyUSBn", where n is a number depending on how many serial USB devices are attached. If you see that your device is ttyUSB0, you have to use serial:/dev/ttyUSB0 as your URI.

IIO Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different commands that can be used to manage and control the device being used. The :doc:`iio_attr </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/iio_attr>` command reads and writes IIO attributes.

::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_attr [OPTION]...

Example:

-  To look at the context attributes, enter this code on the terminal:

::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_attr -a -C

The :doc:`iio_reg </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/iio_reg>` command reads or writes SPI or I2C registers in an IIO device. This is generally not needed for end applications but can be useful in debugging drivers. Note that you need to specify a context using the *-u* qualifier when you are not directly accessing the device via RPI or when you are using the ADICUP3029 platform.

::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_reg -u <context> <device> <register> [<value>]

Example:

-  To read the device ID (register = 0x02) of an ADT7420 interfaced via RPI from a Windows machine, enter the following code on the terminal:

::

   iio_reg -u ip:<ip address> adt7420 0x02

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Make sure to download/update to the latest version of IIO Oscilloscope found on this link\ :git-iio-oscilloscope:`releases`


-  Once done with the installation or an update of the latest IIO Oscilloscope, open the application. The user needs to supply a URI, which will be used in the context creation of the IIO Oscilloscope and the instructions can be seen in the previous section.
-  Press refresh to display available IIO Devices, once ADT7420 appeared, press connect.

PyADI-IIO
~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`PyADI-IIO </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/pyadi-iio>` is a Python abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO drivers to make them easier to use. This module provides device-specific APIs built on top of the current libIIO Python bindings. These interfaces try to match the driver naming as much as possible without the need to understand the complexities of libIIO and IIO.

Follow the step-by-step procedure on how to install, configure, and set up PYADI-IIO and install the necessary packages/modules needed by referring to this :doc:`link </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/pyadi-iio>`.

Running the example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing and configuring PYADI-IIO in your machine, you are now ready to run python script examples. In our case, run the **adt7420_example.py** found in the examples folder.

For No-OS
^^^^^^^^^

At `line 38 of the example python script <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio/blob/325a10861bcb154c96628e74ecb41ce977fd1fc9/examples/adt7420_example.py#L38>`_, the COM indicated should be updated based on your device. In a Windows machine, you can check the port of your MAX32655FTHR and MAX32650FTHR via Device Manager in the Ports (COM & LPT) section. If your device is in COM18, line 38 should be: <code> temp_sensor = adi.adt7420(uri="serial:COM18,57600,8N1")</code> To run the example python script, iio example hex should be loaded in the maxim platform before running the line below: <code> D:\\pyadi-iio\\examples>python adt7420_example.py </code>

Press enter and you will get these readings.
