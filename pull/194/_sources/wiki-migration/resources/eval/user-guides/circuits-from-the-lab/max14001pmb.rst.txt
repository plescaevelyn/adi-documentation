MAX14001PMB Single-channel 10-bit ADC PMOD User Guide
=====================================================

The :adi:`MAX14001PMB` peripheral module provides the hardware to evaluate the MAX14001 isolated ADC to measure two channels of data, line voltage (up to 230V AC or ±325V DC), and load current (up to 5A). All power and communication are with a simple USB cable—no separate field-side power is required. The integrated DC-DC converter provides power isolation for the system and powers all field-side circuitry. This integrated design reduces the BOM and board dimension for building an isolated ADC system.

The module has two MAX14001 devices (U11 and U51). One channel is configured to measure the line voltage with the maximum voltage range selected by a resistor chain. The other channel is configured to measure the voltage across a shunt resistor to provide load current. Both AC and DC signals can be measured. Connector X2 provides the connection of the input signal to the MAX14001 device.

Power Supply Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the MAX14001 PMOD board, the 3.3 V power comes directly from the host board it is connected to. The power from the host is generally capable of providing up to 100 mA at 3.3 V; but for complete PMOD power specifications, please click\ `here <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_.

Digital Interface (PMOD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMOD interface is a series of standardized digital interfaces for various digital communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, and UART. These interface types were standardized by Digilent, which is now a division of National Instruments. Complete details on the PMOD specification can be found `here <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_.

Connector X1 provides a connection of the module to the Pmod host. It has a 12-pin Pmod™-compatible connector for SPI communication. The pin assignments and functions adhere to the Pmod standard recommended by Digilent.

Device Driver Support
---------------------

There are two device driver solutions that are provided for controlling the **MAX14001PMB**:

-  **MAX14001 no-OS Driver**

   -  The :doc:`MAX14001 no-OS driver </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/uc-drivers/max14001>` is used in bare-metal applications, typically running on low-power, embedded microcontrollers.
