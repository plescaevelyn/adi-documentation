Optical Platform: pH Measurement Demo
=====================================

Colorimetry can be used to determine the concentration of materials in a
solution based on its absorbance. One application of colorimetry is pH
measurement with the aid of a coloring reagent. This document details the steps
in setting up the EVAL-CN0503-ARDZ for pH measurement.

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The EVAL-CN0503-ARDZ is a four-channel optical platform capable of fluorescence,
absorbance and scattering measurements. The two middle channels/light paths are
only capable of absorbance and 180-degree scattering measurements. This demo
uses the two paths for absorbance measurements for two different light
wavelengths.

Measuring pH using colorimetry involves using a chemical reagent or indicator.
Different indicators exhibit different color and light absorbance behavior. Some
indicators break down into different ions which also exhibit different
properties which is why the solution has very different color hues at the ends
of the pH range. For this demo we will be using bromothymol blue from either a
prepared solution or the API pH Test Kit. Bromothymol blue separates into a weak
acid (HIn) and a conjugate base (In). HIn has high absorbance to 430nm light
while In has high absorbance at 615nm light. The demo will use light sources
with these two wavelengths for the two middle channels.

While bromothymol blue exhibits the most change in color in the 6 to 8 pH range,
buffer solutions with known pH solutions can be used to set up the
measurement/calibration curve. The demo uses the CN0503 GUI and details steps to
set-up the pH measurement curve using a spreadsheet.

=================== =========== =================

Initial Connection and Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Connect the 430nm LED Board and the 615nm LED Board to LED2 and LED3,
   respectively.

|image5|

-  Connect the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` to the :adi:`CN0503` and connect a microUSB-to-USB cable from the board to the host computer.
-  Run the software (using python scripts or the executable, see the `Quick Setup Guide <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0503/cn0503_gui_quick_start_guide.docx>`_) and wait for the main window to open.

|image6|

-  Click the Gear icon at the top right of the window to open Settings.

|image7|

-  Select the correct COM Port of the device and connect (see `Quick Setup Guide <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0503/cn0503_gui_quick_start_guide.docx>`_ for help)

|image8|

-  Load the configuration file for pH Measurement (`cn0503_defaults_ph.zip <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0503/cn0503_defaults_ph.zip>`_)
-  Configure the settings for path 2 and 3 with the desired name, set
   wavelengths to 430 and 615, respectively, and select measurement type:
   absorption for both.

|image9|

-  Add empty cuvette/s (or filled with distilled water) to the cuvette holder
   assembly and insert to path 2 and 3, and click Optimize LED for each path.
   This properly sets the LED current in these paths so that the light intensity
   is close to 50%.

|image10|

Setting a Baseline Ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The baseline ratio is used to remove small factors introduced to the measurement
such as by the optical glass elements, e.g. beam splitter, lens, and filters.
The baseline ratio is the ARAT value of a known setups such as with an empty
cuvette or distilled water sample where it is known that the ratio of incident
and transmitted light should be approximately 1. This value is used as a
reference for successive measurements which will be defined as the relative
ratio RRAT.

-  Click OK on the settings window and on the main window select optical path 3
   and display mode ARAT.

|image11|

-  Click on Start Measurement and note the average value on the graph. Remember
   the empty cuvette or distilled water sample should still be in the path. The
   average value will be used as the baseline ratio for this path.

|image12|

-  Click on Stop Measurement (Repeat the two previous steps for path 3) then,
   click on the settings icon on the top right corner to bring back the settings
   and click on Advanced to bring up the another window.

|image13|

-  In the "Enter a direct command" text field, type "DEF1 RATB <average value>"
   for path 2 and "DEF2 RATB <average value>" for path3, then press Send
   Command. Replace the <average value> to the value you have noted earlier.

|image14|

-  Optionally, you can write pH to the primary unit field of path 2 and path 3.
   These are just labels and are not necessary.

|image15|

-  Click Okay here and on the settings window to go back to the main. Remove the
   empty cuvette/s or distilled water sample/s. The device is now ready to
   measure pH.

Performing a pH Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Place a prepared cuvette with the test sample to either path 2 and path 3.
   Check the Preparing Test Sample section on how to prepare a cuvette with the
   test sample and indicator.

|image16|

-  Select either path 2 or path 3, set display mode to INS1, and press Start
   Measurement.

|image17|

.. important::

   For quick demo purposes, the system was configured in path 3, by default, to use the measurement curve shown below. Check the :doc:`Generating a Measurement Curve </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0503/fluorescence>` section on how to set your own using spreadsheets and the advanced settings

Preparing Test Samples
----------------------

Using colorimetry for pH measurement requires a reagent or indicator. The demo
uses the API pH Test Kit which uses a reagent with hue similar to that of
bromothymol blue. To prepare solutions in a cuvette for pH measurement with the
CN0503, follow the steps outlined below.

-  If the cuvette was previously used, clean the cuvette with distilled water and let dry
-  Add the solution to be tested to the cuvette up to 3/4 of the line at the top.
-  Add one drop of from the API pH Test Kit dropper bottle.
-  Cap the cuvette tightly and turn it upside down at least 3 times to thoroughly mix the reagent with the solution.
-  If the solution in the cuvette has uniform color, it can now be used with the
   CN0503. Below is a photo of prepared samples from common household chemicals.

|image18|

Generating a Measurement Curve
------------------------------

| The pH measurement curve is a function which models the relationship of the absorbance of either the weak acid or conjugate base of the reagent used to the pH of the solution. You can generate your own measurement curve using samples with known pH. The CN0503 is capable of approximating this using a 5th order polynomial function.

.. important::

   While measurement curves use absorbance to measure pH, the CN0503 uses the
   relative ratio RRAT. RRAT is the absolute ratio (ARAT) of the transmitted
   light intensity to the incident light intensity, and divided by the baseline
   ratio. RRAT is related to absorbance using the equation below.

   | |image19|
   | It is possible to change the mathematical expression for the ARAT but this demo will stick to using the default

Using Microsoft Excel, it is easy to generate the measurement curve by following
the steps outlined below.

-  Create list of the RRAT measurements of each sample and the known pH in 2
   different columns.

|image20|

-  To get the RRAT measurement of a solution, select either path 2 or 3 and RRAT
   in the display units, and click Start Measurement

|image21|

   -  Use the average or median of the measurement values.

-  Create a scatter plot of of the two columns with RRAT as the X-variable and
   pH as the y-Variable

|image22|

-  Create a trend-line for the scatter plot and select the polynomial option
   with an order of up to 5. Also, check the box at the bottom to Display
   Equation on chart

|image23|

-  Use the equation of the trendline and input the coefficients to the CN0503 using the Command field in the Advanced settings. See the :doc:`Software User Guide </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/reference_designs/demo_cn0503>` for details on the command.
