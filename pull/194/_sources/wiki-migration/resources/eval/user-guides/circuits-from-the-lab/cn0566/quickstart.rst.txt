   This is the step file for the HB100 holder, with a 1/4-20 thread for a standard camera mount. HB100s can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, so please do a quick measurement on the one you have, and make any necessary adjustments to the step file.

   
   Alternatively, use one of the other mounting methods described in the quick-start video.

SD card / Software Setup
------------------------

In order for the Raspberry Pi to control the Phaser devices, you will need to write the ADI Kuiper Linux image to an SD card and configure it. **The SD card that ships with the phaser kit MUST be updated with a new image.** The Phaser software is tested with Kuiper Linux 2021_R2, which, in spite of the "2021" in the name, was released in Spring, 2023. While there are newer Kuiper Linux releases, this version is required to maintain compatibility with the current phaser software packages.

Complete instructions for how to write it to the SD card and how to configure an example system are provided at :doc:`Analog Devices Kuiper Linux </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`.

**Hints:** The Kuiper Linux wiki pages give a few options, but the "official" Raspberry Pi imager is very straightforward: `Raspberry Pi Imager <https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/>`_

.. note::

   Switch to :git-adi-kuiper-imager:`ADI Kuiper Imager <adi-kuiper-imager>` once it's stable and documented on the wiki.


After writing the image, if a window pops up saying "this card needs to be formatted, would you like to format it now?", the answer is **NO.** Eject the card and insert it into the Raspberry Pi's SD card slot.

Assembling, Booting and Configuring the System

Figure 3. Test Setup Functional Block Diagram

-  Connect ADALM-Pluto's **CENTER** micro-USB port to Raspberry Pi via micro-USB to USB cable.
-  **CAREFULLY** thread the tripod into the tripod mount. Please minmize stress on the tripod mount while plugging in cables and other operations, as it is screwed directly to the PC board.
-  Verify that the SD card is properly inserted into the slot on the Raspberry Pi.
-  EITHER:

   -  Connect an HDMI display, USB keyboard, and USB mouse to the Raspberry pi, OR
   -  For remote login, connect the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet jack to your wired network, or directly to a host computer's Ethernet jack

-  Power up the setup through the type-C port of the CN0566. Do NOT connect a supply to the Raspberry Pi.
-  Wait for Raspberry Pi to boot. (This may take a minute or two, as the filesystem is expanded on first boot.)
-  After booting, if you are using a keyboard and local display open a terminal as seen on the taskbar. If you are logging in over the network connection, you can open a graphical desktop VNC session or command line SSH session to hostname **analog.local**

Configuring the SD Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to configure the SD card is by running a setup script. This does require a wired or wireless internet connection, but it is much easier than doing things manually. A wired connection is fairly straightforward if your network supports DHCP. If you need to use a wireless connection, you'll have to boot to the graphical desktop and connect manually. Once connected to a network, run the following commands (and take a look at the setup script if you're suspicious, and note that there may be some updates as newer versions of Kuiper Linux are released.) The script is commented if you want a detailed description of what it's doing.

::

   wget https://github.com/thorenscientific/rpi_setup_stuff/raw/main/phaser/phaser_sdcard_setup.sh
   sudo chmod +x phaser_sdcard_setup.sh
   ./phaser_sdcard_setup.sh
   sudo reboot

(Wait for the system to reboot) **Note:** After running the script, the hostname will be **phaser.local**

If you are going to be running scripts and other software directly on the Raspberry Pi, it's a good idea set a few options using the Raspberry Pi configuration utility. This can be accessed from the Start Menu under Preferences, or by running:

::

   sudo raspi-config

from the command line. Set the locale, keyboard, timezone, and wifi country (if you'll be connecting to your network by wifi.)

You'll also need to downgrade the numpy version to fix a compatibility issue with our existing example python scripts:

::

   sudo pip install --force-reinstall numpy==1.22

Software Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, the GUI can be run from the command line. Power up the HB100 source with either a 3V benchtop power supply or two AA cells and aim it a the phaser antenna. Run the following command to find the HB100 frequency:

::

   cd ~/pyadi-iio/examples/phaser
   python phaser_find_hb100.py

Ideally, there should be a single, sharp peak as shown in the figure below.


|image1|

.. container:: centeralign

   Figure 1. Find HB100 script


If there is a single prominent peak, enter "y". If there are several peaks or no visible peak, close the plot and enter 'n' at the prompt. Reposition the HB100 (and make sure there are no other sources nearby), then re-run the script. Next run the GUI:

::

   cd ~/pyadi-iio/examples/phaser
   python phaser_gui.py

The GUI should load and begin displaying the beam pattern as shown below.

Initial Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The phaser board is initially uncalibrated; each element will have a slightly different gain and slight phase error due to numerous factors. The phaser_examples.py script provides a calibration utility that will generate calibration files. Shut down the GUI if it is running. Place the HB100 directly in front of the array at `mechanical boresight <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_boresight>`_ , approximately 1.5 m away. Then run:

::

   cd ~/pyadi-iio/examples/phaser
   python phaser_examples.py cal

The script provides debug information and plots as it is running, you may have to close out of each plot for the script to proceed. After running this script, files gain_cal_val.pkl and phase_cal_val.pkl will be placed in the working directory. The GUI program will also load these files automatically when run again.

Refer to :doc:`CN0566 Calibration </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0566/calibration>` for additional details

Appendix: Pluto Setup
---------------------

The Pluto that ships with the phaser kit has been pre-configured. In case something goes wrong, here is how to update the firmware and settings. For the CN0566, the TDD engine and additional control signals are required for some configurations, and were added as of Pluto firmware 0.38. The latest firmware is available from:

`releases <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw/releases>`_

The next step is to update the Pluto configuration to enable the AD9361's second channel. Follow the directions at: :doc:`Updating to the AD9364, </wiki-migration/university/tools/pluto/users/customizing>` For **setting the mode of a Rev. C PlutoSDR to 2r2t, the following would be sequence of commands:**

::

   fw_setenv attr_name compatible
   fw_setenv attr_val ad9361
   fw_setenv compatible ad9361
   fw_setenv mode 2r2t
   reboot

Verify that the configuration was programmed properly by entering the following commands:

::

   fw_printenv attr_name
   fw_printenv attr_val
   fw_printenv compatible
   fw_printenv mode

Wihich should return:

::

   # fw_printenv attr_name
   attr_name=compatible
   # fw_printenv attr_val
   attr_val=ad9361
   # fw_printenv compatible
   compatible=ad9361
   # fw_printenv mode
   mode=2r2t
   #

Appendix: Configuration Script Notes
------------------------------------

.. tip::

   To manually edit config.txt, add the following:

   
   ::
   
      # Phaser board overlay:
      dtoverlay=rpi-cn0566
   
      # Heartbeat blinky:
      dtparam=act_led_gpio=26
      dtparam=act_led_trigger=heartbeat
   
      # Short GPIO121 (pin 40) to ground for shutdown:
      dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=21,active_low=1,gpiopull=up
   
   If you will be logging in via VNC, see this article: `RPi 4 4gb slow VNC <https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/141147/rpi-4-4gb-slow-vnc>`_ Also if running "headless" without a monitor, set the HDMI group and mode accordingly:
   
   ::
   
      # dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
   
      # uncomment to force a specific HDMI mode (this will force 1920x1080)
      hdmi_group=2
      hdmi_mode=82
