~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DS1 is the power green LED indicator of the board.


|image3|

Power Supply Considerations and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the AD5592R PMOD board, the 3.3V power for the PMOD comes directly from the host board it is connected to. The power from the host is generally capable of providing up to 100 mA at 3.3V, but for complete PMOD power specifications please click\ `here <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_.

Device Driver Support
---------------------

There are two device driver solutions that are provided for controlling the **EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ**:

-  **AD5592R no-OS Driver**

   -  The :doc:`AD5592R no-OS driver </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/uc-drivers/ad5592r>` is used in bare-metal applications, typically running on low-power, embedded microcontrollers.

-  **AD5592R Linux Driver**

   -  The :doc:`AD5592R Linux driver </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-dac/ad5592r>` is used in applications running the Linux operating system, typically on larger processors and SoC devices.

      -  The AD5592R Linux driver uses the Industrial Input/Output (IIO) framework, greatly simplifying the development of application code via the cross-platform Libiio library, which is written in C and includes bindings for Python, MATLAB, C#, and other languages. Application code can run directly on the platform board, communicating with the device over the local backend, or from a remote host over the network or USB backends.

System Setup Using ADICUP3029

Application Software (All Platforms)
------------------------------------

Hardware Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Libiio is a library used for interfacing with IIO devices and is required to be installed on your computer.

.. admonition:: Download
   :class: download

   Download and Install the latest :git-libiio:`Libiio package <releases>` on your machine.


To be able to connect your device, the software must be able to create a context. The context creation in the software depends on the backend used to connect to the device as well as the platform where the EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ is attached. Two platforms are currently supported for the AD5592R: Raspberry Pi using the ADI Kuiper Linux and the ADICUP3029 running the no-OS AD5592R demo project. The user needs to supply a **URI** which will be used in the context creation.

The :doc:`iio_info </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/iio_info>` command is a part of the libIIO package that reports all IIO attributes.

Upon installation, simply enter the command on the terminal command line to access it.

For RPI Direct Local Access:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   iio_info

For Windows machine connected to Raspberry Pi:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   iio_info -u ip:<ip address of your ip>

Example:

-  If your Raspberry Pi has the IP address 192.168.1.7, you have to use *iio_info -u ip::192.168.1.7* as your URI

.. note::

   Do note that the Windows machine and the RPI board should be connected to the same network in order for the machine to detect the device.


IIO Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different commands that can be used to manage and control the device being used. The :doc:`iio_attr </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/iio_attr>` command reads and writes IIO attributes.

::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_attr [OPTION]...

Example:

-  To look at the context attributes, enter this code on the terminal:

::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_attr -a -C

The :doc:`iio_reg </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/iio_reg>` command reads or writes SPI or I2C registers in an IIO device. This is generally not needed for end applications but can be useful in debugging drivers. Note that you need to specify a context using the *-u* qualifier when you are not directly accessing the device via RPI or when you are using the ADICUP3029 platform.

::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_reg -u <context> <device> <register> [<value>]

Example:

-  To read the device ID (register = 0x02) of an AD5592R interfaced via RPI from a Windows machine, enter the following code on the terminal:

::

   iio_reg -u ip:<ip address> ad5592r 0x02

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Make sure to download/update to the latest version of IIO-Oscilloscope found on this link\ :git-iio-oscilloscope:`releases`


-  Once done with the installation or an update of the latest IIO-Oscilloscope, open the application. The user needs to supply a URI which will be used in the context creation of the IIO Oscilloscope and the instructions can be seen in the previous section.
-  Press refresh to display available IIO Devices, once ad5592r appeared, press connect.

PyADI-IIO
~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`PyADI-IIO </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/pyadi-iio>` is a Python abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO drivers to make them easier to use. This module provides device-specific APIs built on top of the current libIIO Python bindings. These interfaces try to match the driver naming as much as possible without the need to understand the complexities of libIIO and IIO.

Follow the step-by-step procedure on how to install, configure, and set up PYADI-IIO and install the necessary packages/modules needed by referring to this :doc:`link </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/pyadi-iio>`.

Running the example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing and configuring PYADI-IIO in your machine, you are now ready to run Python script examples. In our case, run the :git-pyadi-iio:`examples/ad5592r_example.py` found in the examples folder.

<code> D:\\pyadi-iio\\examples>python ad5592r_example.py </code>

Press enter. Input desired voltage levels and you will get these readings.
