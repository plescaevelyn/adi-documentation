**What is a Base Board?**

A Base Board contains an RF transceiver chip and a microcontroller, which combine all the required elements for long range communication. This platform uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, allowing sensors to connect to a network and send and receive data in long distances.

MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board
---------------------------

This development kit comes with the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` as its base board. This board is consisting of the MAX32670 high-reliability, ultralow power microcontroller based on Arm Cortex-M4 processor, and the SX1261 long range transceiver module.

   :width: 600px

**What are Sensor Nodes?**

Sensor nodes are devices that wirelessly send or receive messages to and back from the gateways. These devices communicate with nearby gateways connected through a network server. Depending on the intended applications, sensors can transmit various type of data such as temperature, flow rate, vibration, etc.

Below are the sensor nodes compatible with the MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board. All of these 3 sensors are included in the :adi:`AD-MAX32SXWISE-SL` development kit.

EV-STRUCTURAL-ARDZ Sensor for Structural Monitoring
---------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`EV-STRUCTURAL-ARDZ` is a vibration sensor that uses the ADXL343 digital output MEMS accelerometer chip and the ADIS16203 programmable 360° inclinometer. Aside from providing vibration data, this end node also features the MAX30210 digital temperature sensor which gives the option to shut down sensitive machines and equipment for smart motor sensing applications. This vibration sensor can also detect if the horizontal position of the sensor changes, which points towards a collapse of the structure where the sensor was deployed.

   :align: center
   :width: 600px

EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ Sensor for Flow Rate Metering
-----------------------------------------------

The :adi:`EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ` is an ultrasonic time-of-flight (ToF) flow meter that sends and receives ultrasound waves between piezoelectric transducers in both the upstream and downstream directions in the pipe. By measuring the TOF difference between the upstream and downstream wave travels, utilizing sophisticated digital signal processing techniques, a very accurate flow rate can be calculated.

   :width: 400px

EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ Sensor for Electric Metering
----------------------------------------------

The :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` is an Arduino shield compatible with Arduino Zero. The shield can be directly interfaced with current transformers and voltage leads. It enables quick evaluation and prototyping of energy and power quality measurement systems with the ADE9000. Arduino library and application examples are provided to simplify implementation of larger systems.

   :width: 600px

-  Connect one **Sensor Node** to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board by aligning the corresponding Arduino headers on each board.

.. tip::

   
   You do not have to set up the three sensor nodes altogether, just choose one from the available sensors in the kit:
   
   -  :adi:`EV-STRUCTURAL-ARDZ` for Structural Monitoring
   -  :adi:`EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ` for Flow Rate Metering
   -  :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` for Electric Metering
   


-  Connect the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board through the 10-pin ribbon cable.

.. container:: center round box

   
   **Make sure that the MAX32625PICO programming adapter has been flashed with the correct image before connecting it to the MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board. If you do not know how to load the image, click on the instructions below:** 

.. collapsible:: **How to flash the firmware image in the MAX32625PICO**

   -   Download the firmware image: `MAX32625PICO Firmware Image for MAX32670 <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images/raw/master/bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin>`_
      -   Do not connect the MAX32625PICO to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board yet.
      -   Connect the MAX32625PICO to the Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.
      -   Press the button on the MAX32625PICO. **(Do not release the button until the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)**.

         :align: center
         :width: 400px

      -   Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
      -   Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
      -   After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and the MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware of the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board.


   


-  Connect the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter to the Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.

FAQs
====

.. container:: center round box

   **Q. Why is the serial application not responding after opening the port?** A. It usually happens whenever the power of the base board is not enough to operate the board.

   
   **Q. Can we use other gateways aside from ChirpStack?** A. Customers are not limited to use ChirpStack gateway, it is possible to use other gateways available in the market.
   
   **Q. What maximum number a gateway can handle?** A. It depends on the channels available per assigned region and the time division set by the user on sending data from the nodes to gateway.
   
   **Q. Is there another way to see the GUI without using the local setup?** A. The GUI can also be accessed through cloud service, but it is not supported by ADI.
   
   **Q. What is the maximum distance the gateway and nodes can communicate?** A. The gateway and nodes' maximum and effective range may vary depending on the modulation parameters, transmit power, antenna gain, environmental conditions, and obstacles present in the communication path. In practice, it can reach several kilometers in rural areas with a clear line of sight. The effective range may be shorter in urban areas where obstacle and interference are present.
