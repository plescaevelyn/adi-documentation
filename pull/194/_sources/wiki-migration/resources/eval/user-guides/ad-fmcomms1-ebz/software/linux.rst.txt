AD-FMCOMMS1-EBZ Linux support
=============================

.. warning::

   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be Recommended for New Designs or in
   Production. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.

Analog Devices provides full Linux support for the AD-FMCOMMS1-EBZ. Depending on
which FPGA platform you are using the steps to perform to setup the system
slightly differ:

-  :doc:`ML605 (Microblaze) </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms1-ebz/software/linux/microblaze_ml605>`
-  :doc:`KC705 (Microblaze) </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms1-ebz/software/linux/microblaze_kc705>`
-  :doc:`ZC702, ZC706, ZED (Zynq) </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms1-ebz/software/linux/zynq>`
