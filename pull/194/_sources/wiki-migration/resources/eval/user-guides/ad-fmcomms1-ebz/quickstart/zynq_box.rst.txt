FMComms1 Demo System
====================



.. important::

   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be **Recommended for New Designs** or in
   **Production**. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.



Congratulations, you are about to assemble a demo system, which should have everything you need to properly demo the FMComms1 system and the Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC.

If you don't have a box, and you need to self assemble your kit, please refer to the standard `zynq <https://wiki.analog.com/zynq>`_ documents.
