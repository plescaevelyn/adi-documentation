   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,

   NAME
          xcomm_cal - print and set EEPROM calibration data

   SYNOPSIS
          xcomm_cal [-s] [-f FREQUENCY] INPUT_FILE

   DESCRIPTION
       Print and set EEPROM calibration data. 
       Without option - print all calibration sets available.

       -f Target frequency in MHz

       -s Initialize device drivers with best match calibration set.
          This option is used together with the -f option.

Download/Install
----------------

Git: :git-fmcomms1-eeprom-cal:`fmcomms1-eeprom-cal`

::

   root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# git clone :git-fmcomms1-eeprom-cal:`fmcomms1-eeprom-cal`.git
   root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# cd fmcomms1-eeprom-cal
   root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# make
   root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# make install

Find the EEPROM
---------------

Normally, the calibration EEPROM responds to I2C Slave address 0x55, but it depends on the hardware carrier, and the slot that the card is plugged into.

To find the eeprom - use the ``find`` command.

::

   root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# find /sys/ -name eeprom
   /sys/devices/amba.1/41600000.i2c/i2c-1/1-0050/eeprom
   /sys/devices/amba.1/41600000.i2c/i2c-1/1-0054/eeprom

It's normally the largest value. (the smaller value is the `FRU eeprom <https://wiki.analog.com/fru_dump>`_).

Query best match calibration set for a given Frequency
