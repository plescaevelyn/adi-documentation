Prerequisites for AD9081 based boards
=====================================

.. important::

   We are in the process of migrating our documentation to GitHubIO. This page is outdated and the new one can be found at https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/documentation/solutions/reference-designs/eval-ad9081/prerequisites.html


What you need, depends on what you are trying to do. As a minimum, you need to start out with:

-  The AD9081 based card.
-  A carrier platform. ADI does not offer these boards for sale or loan, getting one yourself is normal part of development or evaluation of the AD9081. Our recommended carriers (the ones we use all the time) are either:

   -  The `Xilinx ZCU102 <https://www.xilinx.com/zcu102>`_. The fabric on this device is much larger, and if you are looking at targeting - this is the recommended option.
   -  The `Xilinx VCU118 <https://www.xilinx.com/vcu118>`_. The device has GTY transceivers which can support higher lane rates. If you need JESD 204C modes this is the recommended option.
   -  There are a few more boards, which do work, but are currently not yet supported. The experience of the fabric only solutions is very close to the ARM/FPGA SoC based solutions, but the GUI runs on a host PC (Windows or Linux).

.. note::

   See `quickstart <https://wiki.analog.com/quickstart#supported_carriers>`_


-   some way to interact with the platform,

   -  for the ARM/FPGA SoC platforms, this normally includes:

      -  DisplayPort monitor
      -  USB Keyboard
      -  USB Mouse

   -  for the FPGA only solutions, this includes:

      -  LAN cable (Ethernet)
      -  Host PC (Windows or Linux)

-  Internet connection (without proxies makes things much easier) to update the scripts/binaries on the SD Card that came with the ADI FMC Card. (Firewalls are OK, proxies make things a pain).
-  RF Test equipment
