Analog Devices Board Support Packages Toolbox For MATLAB and Simulink
=====================================================================

ADI maintains a set of tools to model, interface, and target with specific hardware devices within MATLAB and Simulink. These are combined into single Toolbox which contains a set of Board Support Packages (BSP). The list of supported boards is provided :doc:`below </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/matlab_bsp>`.

Quick Start with BSP
--------------------

The current stable Toolbox can be downloaded from the `TransceiverToolbox GitHub Release Page <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/TransceiverToolbox/releases>`_. Download the latest mltbx file then open that file within MATLAB. Opening the file will automatically install the Toolbox, adding the necessary components to your MATLAB path. The "Analog Devices, Inc. Board Support Packages" will appear in your `Add-Ons Explore <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/manage-your-add-ons.html>`_ within MATLAB.

To interface and stream data with hardware will require installation of :doc:`libiio </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcdaq2-ebz/software/linux/applications/libiio>` and one of two Hardware Support Packages from MathWorks. The libiio library can be obtained on the `Github <http://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio>`_ page of the project.

Libiio Installers

   -  `Communications Toolbox Support Package for Analog Devices ADALM-Pluto Radio <https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/plutoradio/index.html>`_
   


is required to use the streaming system objects or blocks. These support packages provide the necessary libIIO MATLAB bindings used by ADI's system objects.

Building the Toolbox Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The toolbox can only be built under Linux or with Cygwin on a Windows platform. Conveniently, the entire process is automated with a Makefile located in the CI/scripts folder of the repository. The following is required on the system before the build process can be run:

-  A supported MATLAB version installed in the default location (/usr/local/MATLAB)
-  A supported Vivado version installed in the default location (/opt/Xilinx)
-  Packages: git zip unzip tar make wget sed

.. warning::

   You should only manually build the toolbox if you require a custom branch or no toolbox installer is available


First clone the repo and move into it:

::

   git clone :git-TransceiverToolbox:`TransceiverToolbox`
   cd TransceiverToolbox

To build the toolbox run the following:

::

   make -C CI/scripts build

Add the application libraries for AD936X based devices if desired

::

   make -C CI/scripts add_libad9361

To create a installable tlbx file run:

::

   make -C CI/scripts gen_tlbx

Device Control and Data Streaming
---------------------------------

Device interfaces which provide control and data streaming are implemented with MATLAB System Objects and Simulink Blocks. These System Objects can be access under the "adi" namespace in MATLAB and are followed by their part number or board name and finally Tx or Rx:

::

   adi.<Part or Board Name>.<Tx or Rx>

For example, to instantiate an AD9361 object to control the Tx aspects of the transceiver it can be created as follows:

::

   tx = adi.AD9361.Tx;

All supported boards are derived from low level objects based on their parts. For example, the DAQ2 Evaluation board actually contains an AD9680 and AD9144. Therefore, it simply uses AD9680 and AD9144 objects under the hood. However, to interact with the more familiar DAQ2 interface naming the Rx side can be instantiated like above as:

::

   rx = adi.DAQ2.Rx;

For example usage of certain objects, it can be useful to inspect their related test code which exercises initiations in different configurations. The available code is available in the GitHub repo folder :git-MathWorks_tools:`here <test>`, where object tests have the naming convention <Object>Tests.m.

To get a list of currently available objects with the BSP installed simply run:

::

   help adi

To get more information on a given object run:

::

   help adi.<Part of Board Name>.<Tx or Rx>

or

::

   doc adi.<Part of Board Name>.<Tx or Rx>

Common Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some common attributes that need to be set for system objects and parts.

-  ``uri`` Context address of IIO device. Possible options include:

   -  IP with usage ''rx.uri = 'ip:192.168.2.1' ''
   -  USB with usage ''rx.uri = 'usb:1.2.3' ''

Extending Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a driver attribute or setting is not available in the standard objects it can be easily extended to cover more IIO attributes. See this :doc:`guide </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/matlab_bsp_extend>`.

HDL Targeting with HDL-Coder
----------------------------

The Analog Devices BSP for MathWorks HDL Workflow Advisor is a collection of board definitions and reference designs that provide to the MathWorks HDL Workflow Advisor support to:

-  Generate IP blocks compatible with Analog Devices HDL reference designs for various Analog Devices platforms
-  Automatically insert the generated IPs into the Analog Devices Vivado HDL reference designs

The Analog Devices BSP is based on the `MathWorks Board and Reference Design Registration System <https://www.mathworks.com/help/hdlcoder/ug/board-and-reference-design-system.html>`_.

Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `MathWorks HDL Workflow Advisor <https://www.mathworks.com/help/hdlcoder/examples/getting-started-with-hardware-software-codesign-workflow-for-xilinx-zynq-platform.html>`_ enables users to automatically generate HDL code from a Simulink model. The user can choose from a selection of several different Target Workflows, including “ASIC/FPGA”, “FPGA-In-The-Loop”, and “IP Core Generation”. Target Platform selections include Xilinx Evaluation Boards and Altera Evaluation Boards as well as other custom evaluation boards.

The Analog Devices BSP for HDL Workflow Advisor extends the set of Target Workflows for IP Core Generation with the Analog Devices boards listed in the *Supported Platforms* section. The BSP consists of a set of board definitions that specify all the characteristics needed by the HDL Workflow Advisor to be able to incorporate a board in the code generation flow, as well as a set of Xilinx Vivado reference designs that are used by the Workflow Advisor to automatically insert the generated IPs into the Vivado designs. All the Analog Devices Vivado HDL reference designs have inside a ‘donut hole’ to accommodate custom IPs. Each design exposes a set of interface signals to which the IP can connect to. All these signals are specified in the board definition and are available in the Workflow Advisor GUI to connect to the generated IP’s ports.

When running the Workflow Advisor the first step if to select the Target Platform. The figure below shows some of the available Analog Devices target platforms.

   :width: 600px

The next step is to configure the interfaces between the IP and the reference design. Each target platform has a set of interface signals that are accessible in the *Target Platform Interfaces* drop down boxes form step 1.2 (Set Target Interface) of the HDL Workflow Advisor. The figure below shows an example of how to configure the target interface for a specific model.

All the Analog Devices AD9361 based SDR platforms have the same interface signals and they are dependent on the type of flow that is selected – receive (Rx) or transmit (Tx). The table below describes the interface signals for the AD9361 based SDR platforms.

The custom IP always runs at the sample clock and must be able to process / generate a sample every clock cycle.

Once the target interface has been defined, make sure to select the "Target Language" as Verilog (defaults to VHDL) in Step 3.1.1 of the HDL Workflow Advisor. All the other settings of steps 2 and 3 of the HDL Workflow Advisor can be left in their default state and the project generation process can be started by running step 4.1 (Create Project). The result of this step is a Vivado project which has the custom IP core integrated into the Analog Devices HDL reference design. The bistream for the design can be generated either by running step 4.4 (Create bistream) or by compiling the generated Vivado Project directly in Vivado. The project can be found in the *hdl_prj/vivado_ip_prj* folder.

Creating a BOOT.BIN from HDL Workflow Advisor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike the support package provided by MathWorks, the update process for the bitstreams requires creation of a BOOT.BIN file which will be compatible with the ADI SD card.

First make sure you have a valid SD card for your platform with the necessary devicetree and kernel image selected. :doc:`Follow this process here </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`.

Once your SD card is ready, in step 4.3 "Build FPGA Bitstream" of HDL Workflow Advisor select a custom Tcl file for synthesis build. Utilize this :git-MathWorks_tools:`CI/scripts/adi_build.tcl` file located within the BSP as your custom tcl file.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/hwa_custom.png

   :width: 600px

Once the bitstream is built it will generate the BOOT.BIN necessary for booting your system. Place the generated BOOT.BIN in the root of your ADI SD card's BOOT partition.
