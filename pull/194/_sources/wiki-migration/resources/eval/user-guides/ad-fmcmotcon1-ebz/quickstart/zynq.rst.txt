AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ Linux on Zynq Quick Start Guide
=================================================



.. warning::

   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be Recommended for New Designs or in
   Production. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.



This guide provides some quick instructions (still takes awhile to download, and set things up) on how to setup the AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ on either:

-  `ZED Board <http://www.zedboard.org/>`_, Rev C or later

.. important::

   Even thought this is Linux, this is a persistent file system. Care should be taken not to corrupt the file system -- please shut down things, don't just turn off the power switch. Depending on your monitor, the standard power off could be hiding. You can do this from the terminal as well with: ``sudo shutdown -h now``
