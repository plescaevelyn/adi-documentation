ADI FMC Motor Drive System Introduction
=======================================



.. warning::

   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be Recommended for New Designs or in
   Production. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.



**The ADI FMC motor drive solution solution consist of the following products**

-  :doc:`AD-FMCMOTCON1-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcmotcon1-ebz/hardware/controller_board>` - Controller board. Compatible with all Xilinx FPGA platforms with FMC LPC or HPC connectors.
-  :doc:`AD-DRVLV1-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcmotcon1-ebz/hardware/lv_board>` - Low voltage drive board. Connects to the Controller board and has a power stage that can drive drive Brushed DC / BLDC / PMSM / Stepper motors up to 48V and 18A.
-  :doc:`AD-DYNO1-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcmotcon1-ebz/hardware/dyno>` - Dynamometer drive system. Acts as an electronically adjustable load with two BLDC motors connected in a dyno setup.
