Overview
--------

The **AD-GMSL717MIPI-EVK** allows connecting a wide range of cameras with 15-pin MIPI CSI-2 ribbon cable interfaces to Analog Devices’ MAX96717 GMSL2 serializer, enabling connectivity to processing systems which have GMSL2 receive interfaces. Due to its compact form-factor and mounting holes, the board can be easily and securely integrated into vision systems with various requirements in terms of size, shape, and mobility. A detachable extension allows mounting on tripods with 1/4”-20 mounts.
