AD7124 Eval+ Demo Modes
=======================

Requirements
------------

-  Eval+ software installed and open
-  AD7124-4/AD7124-8 evaluation board
-  System demonstration platform board (EVAL-SDP-CB1Z/EVAL-SDP-CK1Z)
-  USB cable
-  PC running Windows with USB 2.0 port

Noise Test Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the AD7124-4/AD7124-8 is a 24-bit ADC, there will be noise or flicker in
the LSBs. This is expected for sigma delta converters. The noise test measures
the noise for an externally shorted input. The magnitude of the noise is
dependent on the output data rate, gain and filter type selected. For a shorted
input, the noise of the AD7124-4/AD7124-8’s internal blocks only are measured
i.e. the ADC core and the PGA. Note that for a shorted input, the reference
(internal or external) does not contribute to the noise measurement. The
reference noise becomes important for non-zero inputs.

2 Wire RTD Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD7124-4/8 offers programmable precision current sources for use with RTD
sensors. In 2-wire RTD mode a single current source is required and this current
can be made available on any AINx pin. Due to the error associated with lead
resistance 2-wire RTD configurations should only be used when lead wires are
short to minimize the error.

Hardware Set-up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specific Requirements
"""""""""""""""""""""

-  2-wire Pt100 RTD sensor
-  Sensor voltage measured across AIN2-AIN3
-  5.11kΩ precision resistor
-  250Ω resistor for headroom on the REFIN- buffer.

The configuration for the 2-wire RTD circuit is shown below. The current flows
through RL1, the RTD and RL2. The voltage generated is sensed across AIN2 and
AIN3. In this configuration RL1 and RL2 will add errors as they are in series
with the RTD. To minimize this error, ensure that lead wires are as short as
possible.

This current also flows through the precision 5.11kΩ resistor. The resistor is
connected across REFIN1+ and REFIN1- which generated the reference voltage for
the ADC allowing for a ratiometric configuration.

Thermocouple Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The voltage generated across the thermocouple is measured with respect to an
absolute reference, for example this reference is the internal reference.

Hardware Set-up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specific Requirements
"""""""""""""""""""""

-  Thermocouple type T
-  Sensor voltage measured across AIN2-AIN3
-  5.11kΩ precision resistor
-  250Ω resistor for headroom on the REFIN- buffer.

Shown in the diagram are the connections used for the measurement. Thermocouple
itself is connected to A2 connector (see the silk screen below) on the EVAL
Board. This connector is connected to analog pins AIN2 and AIN3.

A thermistor or a RTD is connected between AIN4 and AIN5 used for the cold
junction measurement, this uses a ratiometric configuration where the reference
is provided externally from one of the on chip precision excitation currents and
a precision resistor across the REFIN1(+/-).

In this example a thermistor is used (R28) which is connected across AIN4 and
AIN5. The cold junction compensation measurement uses a ratiometric
configuration where the 500μA on-chip excitation current is used to excite the
thermistor. This current is also connected across the 5.11kΩ precision resistor.

Tutorial Access (2)
"""""""""""""""""""

For quick access to the tutorial click the blue question mark icon next to the
Thermocouple button

Sampling mode (3)
"""""""""""""""""

-  Setting this to **single capture** causes a single batch of samples to be collected
-  Setting the program to **repeated capture** causes the software to continuously capture batches of samples from the ADC when sample is clicked.
-  Setting this to **data logging** causes the samples to be written to a file. Upon pressing sample in this mode, a dialog box will appear allowing the file name and save location to be set.

Required Samples (4)
""""""""""""""""""""

To select the number of samples required from the ADC in a batch, enter the
value in the samples box. Default value is 100 samples.

Sample (5)
""""""""""

The sample button sends the configuration to the evaluation board and initiates
the data collection effort.

While the software is communicating with the board and retrieving the data, the
window below will be displayed

|image7|

Waveform Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following the completion of the test, the waveform tab will display the the
gathered samples. The plot shows each successive sample of the ADC (input
referred). Indicators on the right of the screen show the channels being
converted. These conversions can be displayed as codes or as volts

The **analysis** section displays key parameters for the current batch of samples including; *peak-to-peak noise* and *rms noise*. More information on the :doc:`waveform tab can be found here </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad7124-x/software>`

Histogram Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data histogram graph shows the number of times each sample of the ADC output occurs. More information on the :doc:`histogram tab can be found here </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad7124-x/software>`

Saving the conversion data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To **save the conversion data** into an Excel file, right-click the waveform graph and select Export Data from the drop-down list that appears. A save dialog box displays, prompting the user to save the data to an appropriate folder location.

Thermistor Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this thermistor demo, a 10kΩ (44031) NTC thermistor sensor was used which is
specified to measure temperature from -50°C to 150°C. The 44031 has a resistance
of 10kΩ at 25°C, 441.117kΩ at -50°C and 237.16Ω at 150°C. This thermistor was
chosen as it is a precision thermistor (accuracy of 0.1°C between 0°C and 70°C)
and highlights the precision achievable from the AD7124. There are a large
number of thermistors available with different accuracies ranging from 0.5°C to
1°C.

Hardware Set-up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specific Requirements
"""""""""""""""""""""

-  10kΩ 44031 NTC thermistor
-  Sensor voltage measured across AIN2-AIN3
-  10kΩ precision resistor

Shown in the diagram is the configuration used for this Thermistor demo. The thermistor is connected in series with a precision reference resistor (RSENSE) in a voltage divider configuration. The internal 2.5V reference of the AD7124-4/AD7124-8 is connected to the thermistor top side of the voltage divider and the bottom side of the precision reference resistor is connected to AVSS. The precision resistor, RSENSE is used to calculate the current through the thermistor. Voltage excitation rather than an excitation current is used to excite the thermistor, the reason for this is that as the thermistor has high resistance at low temperatures, (441.117kOhms), therefore and even the lowest excitation current provided by the AD7124-4/8 would generate a voltage greater than (AVDD – AVSS) at these low temperatures.

For this demo the voltage across the thermistor is measured using analog inputs
the Ain2 and Ain3 inputs of the AD7124-4/AD7124-8. This voltage is then used to
calculate the current through the thermistor [REFOUT/(Vthermistor + Vrsense)]
where Vrsense = (REFOUT - Vthermistor) and from this hence the resistance of the
thermistor is calculated.

Since the thermistor has higher resistance values at lower temperature, the
signal levels are larger (approximately 2.44V at -50°C) thus a gain of 1 is used
in this configuration.

As the thermistor and RSENSE are driven from the internal reference and, the
internal reference is also used as the reference for the ADC measurement, this
gives a ratiometric configuration. This means that any variation of the
reference voltage does not affect the system accuracy.
