AD-FMCADC7-EBZ Quick Start Guides
=================================

.. important::

   This project is obsolete, and is no longer supported. The source code can be
   found in the last release where it was present, hdl_2021_r2 for both HDL and
   software support.

The Quick Start Guides provide simple step by step instructions on how to do an
initial system setup for the AD-FMCADC7-EBZ boards on supported carriers.

Hardware Setup
--------------

In most carriers, the AD-FMCADC7-EBZ board connects to the HPC connector (unless
otherwise noted). The carrier setup requires power, UART (115200), ethernet
(Linux), HDMI (if available) and/or JTAG (no-OS) connections. The Zynq carriers
program the FPGA and boots Linux from the SD card. The fabric only carriers use
XMD to program the FPGA and download the Linux image. Please follow the specific
switch settings for Linux or JTAG (no-OS) mode of your carrier of choice.

All you need to do is build SD card or download the SD card image of the latest releases. The instructions are :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`.
