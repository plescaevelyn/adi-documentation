AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ User Guide
==========================

The AD-FMComms3-EBZ is an FMC board for the :adi:`AD9361`, a highly integrated RF Agile Transceiver™. While the complete chip level design package can be found on the :adi:`the ADI web site <media/en/engineering-tools/design-tools/AD9361_Design_File_Package.zip>`. Information on the card, and how to use it, the design package that surrounds it, and the software which can make it work, can be found here.

The purpose of the AD-FMComms3-EBZ is to provide an RF platform to software developers, system architects, etc, who want a single platform which operates over a much wider tuning range (70 MHz – 6 GHz). It’s expected that the RF performance of this platform can meet the datasheet specifications at 2.4 GHz, but not at the entire RF tuning range that the board supports (but it will work **much** better than the `ad-fmcomms2-ebz <https://wiki.analog.com/ad-fmcomms2-ebz>`_ over the complete RF frequency). We will provide typical performance data for the entire range (70 MHz – 6 GHz) which is supported by the platform. This is primarily for system investigation and bring up of various waveforms from a software team before their custom hardware is complete, where they want to see waveforms, but are not concerned about the last 1dB or 1% EVM of performance.

The AD-FMComms3-EBZ board is very similar to the `ad-fmcomms2-ebz <https://wiki.analog.com/ad-fmcomms2-ebz>`_ board with only one exception, the RX/TX RF differential to single ended transformer. The AD-FMComms3-EBZ is more targetted for wider tuning range applications, that is why we use the `TCM1-63AX+ <http://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/TCM1-63AX+.pdf>`_ from Mini-Circuits as the RF transformer of choice. We affectionately call the FMCOMMS3-EBZ the "Software Engineers" platform, and the FMCOMMS2-EBZ, the "RF Engineers" platform to denote the difference.
