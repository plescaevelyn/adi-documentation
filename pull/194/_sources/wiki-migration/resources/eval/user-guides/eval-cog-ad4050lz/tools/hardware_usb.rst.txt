Driver Installation for On-board Debugger (CMSIS DAP)
=====================================================

The MCU Cog has an on-board debugger which supports the `ARM CMSIS DAP <https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/CMSIS-DAP>`_ interface. When connecting up the EV-COG-AD4050LZ to your computer or laptop, all the necessary drivers are automatically located and loaded up when using Windows operating systems.

There are two sets of drivers that get installed on your computer depending on which mode of operation the EV-COG-AD4050LZ emulator comes up.

.. important::

   It EXTREMELY important to ensure that all drivers are installed, before trying to use the EV-COG-AD4050LZ with the CrossCore Embedded Tools. So when you see that the drivers are being installed in the task bar, open it up and wait till everything finished before progressing.

Mass Storage Drives
-------------------

DAPLINK Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the EV-COG-AD4050LZ emulator is connected to the ADuCM4050 and ready for program/debug mode, the "DAPLINK" drive is displayed on your computer.

This mode allows users to drag and drop (or copy and paste) a .BIN or .HEX [Intel formatted] file directly into the DAPLINK drive, and that file will be flashed directly to the ADuCM4050. This means you don't have to use the tools or the debugger to program your board, making this very useful in production releases or updating applications already in the field.

-  The PC will start searching for and install the following drivers:(if not already complete)

   :align: center
   :width: 550px

-  After that simply drag and drop (or copy and paste) your .BIN or .HEX [Intel formatted] file to the DAPLINK drive, and your EV-COG-AD4050LZ board will be programmed.

   -  Your Windows Explorer browser will close automatically

-  You will need to press the RST button in order for the program to update

   -  Alternatively you could unplug the micro USB cable from the USB port (P5) of the EV-COG-AD4050LZ, and then reconnect it.

Maintenance Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the EV-COG-AD4050LZ emulator is connected to the MK20DX128VFM5 (by holding down the "RST" button while connecting the USB port (P5) to the PC/laptop) the "Maintenance" drive is displayed on your computer. This mode allows a user to overwrite the ADuCM4050 interface file within the emulator. This allows for patches and updates to the firmware on the emulator.

-  The PC will start searching for and install the following drivers:(if not already complete)

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/tools/device_drivers_install_maintenance.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

Workspace and Projects
======================

A CCES workspace is a folder (e.g. c:\\Users\\anon\\cces\\2.6.0) that contains project resources and metadata. When projects are created or imported, details about that project are stored in the workspace. The workspace metadata also includes preferences set through the CCES Preferences dialog box and IDE window layouts. By default, CCES creates new projects within your workspace folder.

Each time you start CCES, you will be prompted for a workspace location. You can opt to default to a workspace directory by choosing to use a workspace directory as your default. You will not be prompted the next time you open CCES.

How to add startup code and core components to a new project for the ADuCM4050
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An out-of-the-box ADuCM4050 project does not have startup code or a linker description file that maps code and data. It is necessary to add these components using the Run-time Environment (RTE) Configuration Editor.

CrossCore Projects created for Analog Devices' Cortex-M based processors, such as ADuCM4050 include a system.rteconfig file. Opening this file within the IDE will open the RTE Configuration Editor. Components from the CMSIS-Pack, such as drivers and services, can be added to a project by selecting them in the editor and clicking Save.

At minimum, a new ADuCM4050 project will require the Device::Startup, CMSIS::Core and Device::Global Configuration components to be added to the project.

-  Double-click on the system.rteconfig to open the RTE Configuration Editor.
-  Select Device::Startup, CMSIS::Core and Device::Global Configuration.
-  Click Save (Ctrl+S)
-  *You can also choose Device::Startup and click the Resolve button to add dependant components*
