Overview
--------

Power quality monitoring is becoming important to keep power grids clean despite
the harmonics introduced by inverter-based resources. Such activity improves the
stability and reliability of the grid and improves equipment health by
preventing flickering or blackouts.

The **AD-PQMON-SL** is a power quality monitoring solution based on the :adi:`ADE9430`, which is a high performance, polyphase energy and Class S power quality monitoring and energy metering device.

This reference design also has an on-board processor, the :adi:`MAX32650` an ultralow power Arm Cortex-M4 with FPU-Based microcontroller (MCU) with 3 MB flash and 1 MB SRAM.

Features
--------

-  Allows prototyping of high performance, polyphase energy meters
-  Modular hardware design:

   -  Metering & compute base board
   -  Add-on board for COMMS and HMI

-  The base board offers flexibility in input/output (I/O) interfacing through custom add-on boards
-  Industrial connectivity: 10BASE-T1L (ADIN1110), RS-485 (ADM2587E), Ethernet (WIZ82)
-  Long time data logging (SD card)
-  Standalone interface (display, LEDs, buttons)
-  I/O prototyping area (external control signals, GPS / GNSS)
-  Publicly available software for evaluation and prototyping
-  no-OS open-source embedded software stack
-  Embedded processing implementing the complete IEC 61000-4-30 class S power quality standard (using ADI proprietary ADSW-PQ-CLS library)
-  Open-source GUI (Scopy – Cross-platform Qt application)
-  Fully isolated design for safe operation
-  Industry standard form factor compatible with DIN rail mounts

Applications
------------

-  Energy and power monitoring
-  Standards compliant power quality monitoring
-  Protective devices
-  Smart power distribution units
-  Polyphase energy meters
-  Intelligent buildings

System setup & evaluation
-------------------------

The solution is delivered with a set of accessories required to put the system
together and get it up and running.

This is what you'll find in the development kit box:

-  1 x :adi:`AD-PQMON-SL` board with enclosure
-  1 x :doc:`AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-t1lusb-ebz>` 10BASE-T1L to USB adapter board
-  1 x PROFIBUS (1x2x18AWG) cable for Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) connectivity

The :adi:`AD-PQMON-SL` comes with pre-programmed firmware enabling the system to interface with a PC application for system configuration, control, and data acquisition.

Support
-------

.. hint::

   Analog Devices will provide limited online support for anyone using the reference design with Analog Devices components via the :ez:`EngineerZone FPGA reference designs <community/fpga>` forum.

   
   It should be noted that the older the tools' versions and release branches
   are, the lower the chances to receive support from ADI engineers.
