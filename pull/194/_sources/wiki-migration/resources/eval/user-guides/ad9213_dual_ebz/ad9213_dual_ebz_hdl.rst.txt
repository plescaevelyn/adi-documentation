AD9213-DUAL-EBZ HDL reference design
====================================

.. important::

   We are in the process of migrating our documentation to GitHubIO. This page is outdated and the new one can be found at https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/projects/ad9213_dual_ebz/index.html\

Functional Overview
-------------------

The AD9213-DUAL-EBZ reference design is a processor based (e.g. ARM) embedded
system. The device interfaces to the FPGA transceivers followed by the
individual JESD204B and ADC cores. The cores are programmable through an
AXI-Lite interface. The samples are initially captured UTIL_ADC_FIFO and then
passed to the system memory (DDR). The user can capture up to 1048576 samples
per channel, if both channels are selected or 2097152 per channel if only one
channel is selected or in the case the data is considered single channel
interposed.

Block Diagram
-------------

The data path and clock domains are depicted on the below diagram:

|image1|

The design has two JESD receive chains each having 16 lanes at rate of 12.5Gbps.
The JESD receive chain consists of a physical layer represented by an XCVR
module, a link layer represented by an RX JESD LINK module. The transport layer
is common and is represented by a RX JESD TPL module. The links operate in
Subclass 1 by using the SYSREF signal to edge align the internal local
multiframe clock and to release the received data in the same moment from all
lanes, therefore ensuring that data from all channels is synchronized at the
application layer.

Both links are set for full bandwidth mode and operate with the following
parameters:

-  Deframer paramaters: L=32, M=2, F=2, S=16, N’=16
-  GLBLCLK – 312.5MHz (Lane Rate/40)
-  REFCLK – 312.5 MHz (Lane Rate/20)
-  SYSREF – 1.46MHz (DEVCLK/2048)
-  DEVCLK – 10000MHz
-  JESD204B Lane Rate – 12.5Gbps

The transport layer component present on the output 1024 bits at once on every
clock cycle, representing 16 samples per converter. The typical AXI_PACK IP does
not meet timing in this design, so a custom one was implemented in the
system_top.v module. An ADC buffer is used to store 1024k samples per converter
in the fabric before transferring it with the DMA.

Clock sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The clock sources are depicted on the below diagram:

   :align: center

Both physical layer transceiver modules receive two reference clocks from
LTC6952 OUT4-7 outputs. The global clock (LaneRate/40) it is received directly
from the OUT8 output and SYSREF is received from OUT9 output of the LTC6952.
