EVAL-ADE9000SHIELDZ Sensor for Electric Metering
================================================

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` is an Arduino shield compatible with Arduino Zero. The shield can be directly interfaced with current transformers and voltage leads. It enables quick evaluation and prototyping of energy and power quality measurement systems with the ADE9000. Arduino library and application examples are provided to simplify implementation of larger systems.

Applications
============

.. tip::

   The :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` can be used with the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board, which is a long-range wireless radio development platform based on MAX32670 ultralow power Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller and SX1261 RF transceiver.

   
   Using these platforms together enables users to design solutions based on low-power, long range proprietary radio communication technique that is suitable for customized heat/flow meters.

System Setup
============

PHASE 1: Hardware Setup
-----------------------

Note that this setup only applies for MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board. Users may use a different base board or microcontroller, however the firmware built for this demo application cannot be used as this is specifically designed for the MAX32670-SX-ARDZ.

Equipment Needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  One (1) :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board
-  One (1) :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` Sensor Node
-  One (1) MAX32625PICO Rapid Development Platform with 10-pin ribbon cable

   -  with firmware image: `MAX32625PICO Firmware Image for MAX32670 <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images/raw/master/bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin>`_

-  One (1) CR123A Battery or any equivalent external DC power supply (+3 V to +4.7 V)

::

      ** Note that this is not included in the kit**
   * One (1) Micro USB to USB cable
   * Host PC (Windows 10 or later)

-  Insert one CR123A battery (3 V to 4.7 V) into the battery holder (BT1 connector) of the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board.

.. container:: center round box

   
   **Make sure to check for the battery polarity in the BT1 connector, refer to the figure below. The DS3 LED will light up indicating that you have inserted the battery correctly and that power is provided in the base board.**\

-  Connect the :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` Sensor Node to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board by aligning the corresponding Arduino headers on each board.
-  Connect the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board through the 10-pin ribbon cable.

.. container:: center round box

   
   **Make sure that the MAX32625PICO programming adapter has been flashed with the correct image before connecting it to the MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board. If you do not know how to load the image, click on the instructions below:** 

.. collapsible:: **How to flash the firmware image in the MAX32625PICO**

   -   Download the firmware image: `MAX32625PICO Firmware Image for MAX32670 <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images/raw/master/bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin>`_
      -   Do not connect the MAX32625PICO to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board yet.
      -   Connect the MAX32625PICO to the Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.
      -   Press the button on the MAX32625PICO. **(Do not release the button until the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)**.

      -   Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
      -   Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
      -   After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and the MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware of the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board.


   


-  Connect the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter to the Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.
