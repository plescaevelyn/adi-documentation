Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL <en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ad-bct2ade9113-sl.html>` is a complete Type 2 EVSE 3.6 kW charging cable solution, providing a reference design intended for evaluation and prototyping of EV charging systems.

The system includes the :adi:`ADE9113` 3-channel isolated sigma-delta (Σ-Δ) ADC for voltage and current measurement on the single-phase power input and measurement of the relay voltage for solder contacts detection and relay state of health. Safe operation is enabled by the inclusion of a 6 mA DC / 30 mA rms RCD. Detection of overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent, overtemperature and EV diode presence are also available.

The :adi:`MAX32655` ultralow power ARM® Cortex®-M4 processor implements the logic for system control and communication with the EV over the control pilot interface. A programming and debugging interface are included. The MAX32655 Bluetooth 5.2 interface enables connectivity to external devices.

The design is accompanied by an open-source software stack and reference
applications, enabling custom software development to start from a proven
implementation validated to meet the applicable standards. The system is
designed to meet the IEC61851 and IEC62752 standards.
