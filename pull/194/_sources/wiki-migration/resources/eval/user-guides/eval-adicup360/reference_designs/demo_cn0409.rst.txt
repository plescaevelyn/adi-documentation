Turbidity Measurement Demo (with EVAL-CN0409-ARDZ)
==================================================

General description
-------------------

The **EVAL-CN0409-ARDZ** shield is a low to high level water turbidity measurement system in combination with the **EVAL-ADICUP360**. It uses the **ADPD105's** ambient light rejection feature to make it ideal for applications where accurate, robust and non-contact turbidity measurements are critical.

Setting up the hardware
-----------------------

-  To program the base board, set the jumpers/switches as shown in the next figure. The important jumpers/switches are highlighted in red.

-  Connect the **EVAL-CN0409-ARDZ** to the Arduino connectors **P2, P5, P6, P7, P8** of the **EVAL-ADICUP360** board.
-  Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the Debug USB.(P14)

Calibration procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the project is being run for the first time a calibration procedure is required in order to achieve high accuracy results. The user must follow the steps described in the UART terminal when the application is started.

The user has the option to modify the solutions that are used for calibrating the device. |image2| Any values can be used for the points that are used for calibration, but a proper distribution along the 0 - 1000 NTU range must be taken into account.

.. note::

   These values can be edited in **CN0409.h** file inside the include folder within the project structure.


After the calibration sequence is done at least once, the calibration coefficients are saved in the controller flash memory and will be used the next time when a calibration is not done. The calibration can be repeated as desired. If the program is run for the first time and a calibration routine is not done, the program will prompt the user to manually input calibration coefficients.

Test Vial Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain a most accurate results when taking measurements, process below should take into considerations:

-  Test vials must be meticulously cleaned. Cleaning involves washing the vials with soap and deionized water, soaking the sample vial in Hydrochloric Acid solution, rinsing with ultra-filtered deionized water, and polishing with silicone oil.
-  Test vials must also be indexed. After the cleaning process, the vial is used to measure a very low turbidity solution. The position with the lowest measured turbidity should be indexed and this position should be used for succeeding measurements.
-  Remove bubbles in the solution. This can be done by letting the solution stand for several minutes to allow the bubbles to vacate.
-  If possible, use one properly indexed test vial.

.. note::

   It is recommended to use `LaMotte Test Vial <https://www.coleparmer.com/i/lamotte-0290-6-turbidity-sample-test-tubes-vials-6-pk/0556366>`_ as the size fits into the on board vial holder


Measurement Procedure
---------------------

-  Fill a clean test vial up to 10mL of the solution under test
-  Allow sufficient time for bubbles to escape before placing the cap
-  Wipe the test vial with a lint free cloth before inserting into the on board test vial holder to make sure it is free from fingerprints.
-  Open putty software and hit reset button on EVAL-ADICUP360. Follow on screen prompt for the calibration as shown below.

.. note::

   For first time use, it is required to perform calibration by typing y key. For the succeeding measurements, just hit n key to skip calibration


-  3-point calibration will perform using 0.02FTU,100 FTU and 800 FTU. Wait for the onscreen prompt before placing each solution.

-  After calibration, place the solution required to measure turbidity as prompted on the screen.

.. note::

   Make sure you are holding on the test vial cap when placing on the holder

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the CN0409.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

The software for the **ADuCM360_demo_cn0409** demo can be found here:
