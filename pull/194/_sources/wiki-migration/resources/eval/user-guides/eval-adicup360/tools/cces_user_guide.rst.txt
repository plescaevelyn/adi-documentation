Workspace and Projects
----------------------

A CCES workspace is a folder (e.g. c:\\Users\\anon\\cces\\2.7.0) that contains project resources and metadata. When projects are created or imported, details about that project are stored in the workspace. The workspace metadata also includes preferences set through the CCES Preferences dialog box and IDE window layouts. By default, CCES creates new projects within your workspace folder.

Each time you start CCES, you will be prompted for a workspace location. You can opt to default to a workspace directory by choosing to use a workspace directory as your default. You will not be prompted the next time you open CCES.

-  Select the *ADuCM36x CMSIS Pack* version (choose version 1.0.2 or higher) from the Packs View.
-  Click the *Install* Action.

.. important::

   The "Check for Updates on Web" option does not work to obtain the ADICUP360 / ADuCM36X pack. Instead, refer to the "Installing Locally Saved ADuCM36x Pack" section (below) after `downloading the ADuCM36x DFP <https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/aducm36x_dfp-analogdevices/boards/>`_.


Installing the ARM CMSIS Pack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Switch to the CMSIS Pack Manager perspective by selecting *Window \| Perspective \| Open Perspective \| Other... \| CMSIS Pack Manager*.
-  Once opened, select *Check for Updates on Web ( blue arrows on the toolbar )*, if you have not already done so.
-  Choose *ARM* in the Devices View.
-  Select the *Generic* and *ARM.CMSIS* from the Packs View, and select the current version (e.g. 5.1.0)
-  Click the *Install* Action.

How to create a new project for the ADuCM360
--------------------------------------------

A project for ADuCM360 can be created using the New CrossCore Project Wizard. This wizard will guide you through the steps to create a new project.

-  To create a new project, go to the menu bar and find *File -> New -> CrossCore Project*.
-  Name the project, and then hit the Next button.
-  Choose Processor family **ARM** and select Processor type **ADuCM360**.

   -  There is no Silicon Revision Option for the ADuCM360, so it defaults to "none"

-  Project configuration allows you to add additional Add-ins to your project, such as Pin Multiplexing and changing the template language for a generated main function etc. Typically no configuration or add-ons are necessary.
-  Finally, press *Finish* and the project will be created and you can begin writing your program.

   :align: center

How to add startup code and core components to a new project for the ADuCM360
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new or empty ADuCM360 project does not have startup code or a linker description file that maps code and data. It is necessary to add these components using the **Run-time Environment (RTE) Configuration Editor**.

CrossCore Projects created for Analog Devices' Cortex-M based processors, such as ADuCM360 include a system.rteconfig file. Opening this file within the IDE will open the RTE Configuration Editor. Components from the CMSIS-Pack, such as drivers and services, can be added to a project by selecting them in the editor and clicking Save.

At minimum, a new ADuCM360 project **requires** the *Device::Startup*, *CMSIS::Core* and *Device::Global* Configuration components to be added to the project.

-  Double-click on the system.rteconfig to open the RTE Configuration Editor.
-  Select Device::Startup, CMSIS::Core and Device::Global Configuration.
-  Click Save (Ctrl+S)
-  *You can also choose Device::Startup and click the Resolve button to add dependant components*

How to configure the debug session for an ADuCM360 application
--------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to create a launch configuration to debug your ADuCM360 program.

-  If you have already built a project, select that project in the Project Explorer View.
-  Right-click on the project and choose *Debug As* and *Application with GDB and OpenOCD (Emulator)*
-  In the *Target* tab, choose *Target (processor)* and in the drop-down select **Analog Devices ADuCM360**
-  In the *Target* tab, choose *Interface* and in the drop-down select **ARM CMSIS-DAP compliant adapter**
-  In the *Main* tab, ensure that your project is selected in the *Project* entry box.

   -  If the correct project is not populated, click the *Browse...* button and choose the project. Note that this is optional and you only need to choose a project if you want the IDE to search a project for the built binaries (programs), otherwise you can leave this entry blank.

-  In the *Main* tab, ensure your binary (program) is selected in the *Application* entry box.

   -  If the correct binary (program) is not populated, click on *Search Project...* and choose the binary (program) from those available in the chosen project.
   -  If your binary (program) is not populated and it was not built from a project in your workspace (i.e. you have a pre-built binary), then click the *Browse...* button and search for your pre-built binary (program). Click *Open* when you have found and selected the pre-built binary (program).

-  In the *Common* tab, you can add the debug configuration to your menu bar shortcuts, for both *Debug mode* or // Run mode// by simply ticking the checkboxes.

Linux USB Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When installing CCES for the first time, you'll be prompted to set up you system, so that you can access USB without root access. If you need to set up access to your USB after installation, perhaps because you answered no during the installation, then you can run the script in *opt/analog/cces/2.7.0/Setup/setup_openocd_permissions.sh* with sudo access.

How to create a Binary (.bin) or Intel Hex (.hex) file for an ADuCM360 application
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with CrossCore Embedded Studio (CCES) 2.8.0, the Artifact of your project build can now be a Binary or Intel Hex file.

-  Ensure that your program is built with semi-hosting disabled by visiting *Tools Settings \| Linker \| Libraries* and change *Semihosting support* to *nosys.specs* or *None*, depending on your application set-up.
-  Rebuild your application.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/tools/360_no_sys.gif

-  Convert your application into Binary (.bin) or Intel Hex (.hex) format by visiting Tools Settings once more.
-  Select the Build Artifact tab.
-  Select Binary (or Intel Hex) as the Artifact Type.
-  Apply and Close
-  Rebuild your application.

How to debug programs using ADuCM362 and ADuCM363 Evaluation Boards
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`ADuCM362/ADuCM363 evaluation board <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-aducm362-aducm363.html>` comes with an Segger J-Link OB emulator which is not supported out of the box by CrossCore Embedded Studio (CCES). However, using Segger's JLinkGDBServer, we can still create and debug our ADuCM362/3 projects using CCES. The following are instructions on how to set up your Debug configuration.

-  Download and install `Segger J-Link Software and Documentation Pack <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack>`_:

   -  Click for downloads and select the install for your platform.
   -  `Or click here to download the latest Windows version <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Windows.exe>`_

-  Run JLinkGDBServer:

   -  Open ``C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGGER\JLink_V512f\JLinkGDBServer.exe`` on Windows.
   -  Run ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/SEGGER/JLink /opt/SEGGER/JLinkGDBServerExe`` on Linux.

-  In the JLinkGDBServer application, choose your Target device. For example, ``ADuCM362``.
-  Click OK to run the JLinkGDBServer.
-  Next create a CCES Debug configuration for your ADuCM362 project/program:
-  In the Target tab:

   -  Change the command from ``openocd`` to the path to PackChk (e.g. ``C:\analog\cces\2.8.1\ARM\packs\ARM\CMSIS\5.3.0\CMSIS\Utilities\Win32\PackChk.exe``) or another executable that will run.

      -  We specify a different executable because running OpenOCD will fail and it will cause the launch configuration to terminate.
      -  It is not necessary to set your target to be ``Analog Devices ADuCM36x`` or your interface to ``Segger J-Link`` but it may help you when identifying your Debug configuration later on.

-  In the Main tab:

   -  Ensure that your project and/or program has been added.

-   In the Debugger tab:

   -  Ensure that ``Use remote target`` is checked.
   -  And that your port number is set to ``2331``.

-  In the Startup tab:

   -  Add the following to Initialization commands:``monitor flash device = ADuCM362
      monitor flash download=1
      monitor flash breakpoints = 1
      monitor clrbp
      monitor endian little
      monitor reset
      monitor halt
      monitor sleep 10
      monitor speed auto``

-  Add the following to Run commands:``monitor reg r13 = (0x00000000)
   monitor reg pc = (0x00000004)
   break main
   continue``
-  Click Debug to start loading and running your program.
