pH Monitor with Temperature Compensation Demo
=============================================

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0326** is a pH monitor with automatic temperature compensation demo project, for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with additional EVAL-CN0326-PMDZ pmod, created using the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins in Eclipse environment.

General description
-------------------

This project is a good example for how to use :doc:`EVAL-ADICUP360 board </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/base_board>` in different combinations with pmod boards. It expand the list of possible applications that can be done with the base board.

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0326** project uses the :adi:`EVAL-CN0326-PMDZ pmod <en/design-center/reference-designs/hardware-reference-design/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0326>` which is a pH sensor signal conditioner and digitizer with automatic temperature compensation.

The CN0326 circuit provides a complete solution for pH sensors with internal resistance between **1 MΩ** and several **GΩ**. It consist of **pH probe** buffer, **Pt1000 RTD** for temperature compensation and **24-bits ADC** with 3 differential analog inputs.

The pH probe consists of a glass measuring electrode and a reference electrode, which is analogous to a battery. When the probe is place in a solution, the measuring electrode generates a voltage depending on the hydrogen activity of the solution, which is compared to the potential of the reference electrode. As the solution becomes more **acidic** (pH < 7) the potential of the glass electrode becomes more positive (**+mV**) in comparison to the reference electrode; and as the solution becomes more **alkaline** (pH > 7) the potential of the glass electrode becomes more negative (**−mV**) in comparison to the reference electrode.

The change in temperature of the solution changes the activity of its hydrogen ions. When the solution is heated, the hydrogen ions move faster which result in an increase in potential difference across the two electrodes. In addition, when the solution is cooled, the hydrogen activity decreases causing a decrease in the potential difference. Electrodes are designed ideally to produce a zero volt (**0 V**) potential when placed in a buffer solution with a pH of 7 (**neutral** pH).

The **EVAL-CN0326-PMDZ** comes with an evaluation software which can help you to test and to calibrate your pmod before you use it.

.. note::

   Please visit :doc:`CN0326 Software User Guide page </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0326>` to find out how to get and how to use the CN0326 evaluation software.

The potential changes are outputted as ADC 24-bits value which is received via
SPI interface of the EVAL-ADICUP360 board. The ADC analog differential channels
are:

-  **AIN1(+)/AIN1(-)** - pH probe (voltage full range: ±414 mV at 25°C to ±490 mV at 80°C)
-  **AIN2(+)/AIN2(-)** - Pt1000 RTD (voltage full range: 210 mV to 290 mV with 210 μA excitation current)
-  **AIN3(+)/AIN3(-)** - Bias current (used to minimized tne voltage errors)

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0326** application purchase ADC outputs from input channels, calculates voltage, temperature and pH values. You can choose to use internal excitation current of the ADC (IOUT2) or calculate bias current of the circuit (see *USE_IOUT2* parameter).

A UART interface (9600 baud rate and 8-bits data length) is used, as a command line interpreter, to send the results to terminal window: **temperature** and **ph** values. Beside this two the interpreter process other three commands: **help**, **calibrate** channel/channels and ADC **reset**.

To start the command line interpreter you need to press ENTER key (CR) from the
keyboard and after that just type in <help> to see available commands. The
output data are send via UART using semihosting.

.. note::

   The calibrate command perform an internal zero and full scale calibration of the selected channel/channels (:adi:`AD7793 Datasheet <media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD7792_7793.pdf>`).

The project uses below formula to determine output **ADC code** for an input voltage on either channel:

**AIN** - analog input voltage

**GAIN** - gain value in the in-amp setting

**N** - ADC resolution (24)

The **temperature** value is calculated using RTD resistance value and it varies from 0°C (1000 Ω) to 100°C (1385 Ω):

**Rrtd** - RTD resistance at T°C

**Rmin** - RTD resistance at 0°C

**α** - temperature coefficient (0.00385 Ω/Ω/°C)

To calculate **pH** value is used Nernst equation:

|image1| **E** - voltage of the hydrogen electrode with unknown activity

**α** - zero point tolerance (±30 mV)

**T** - ambient temperature in °C

**n** - valence, number of charges on ion (1 at 25 °C)

**F** - Faraday constant (96485 coulombs/mol)

**R** - Avogadro's number (8314 mV-coulombs /°K mol)

**pHiso** - reference hydrogen ion concentration (7)

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the
CN0326.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.
