Data Acquisition for Input Current Demo
=======================================

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0336** is a data acquisition demo project for 4-20 mA inputs, for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with additional EVAL-CN0336-PMDZ pmod, created using the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins in Eclipse environment.

General description
-------------------

This project is a good example for how to use :doc:`EVAL-ADICUP360 board </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/base_board>` in different combinations with pmod boards. It expand the list of possible applications that can be done with the base board.

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0336** project uses the :adi:`EVAL-CN0336-PMDZ pmod <en/design-center/reference-designs/hardware-reference-design/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0336>` which is a completely isolated **12-bits**, **300 kSPS** data acquisition system (with only three active devices) that processes **4 mA** to **20 mA** input signals.

The CN0336 circuit consists of an input current-to-voltage converter, a level shifting circuit, an ADC stage and an output isolation stage. The **4 mA** to **20 mA** input signal is converted into **voltage** levels compatible with the input range of the ADC (**0 V** - **2.5 V**). The 12-bits ADC value is received via SPI interface of the EVAL-ADICUP360 board.

The **EVAL-CN0336-PMDZ** comes with an evaluation software which can help you to test and to calibrate your pmod before you use it.

.. note::

   Please visit :doc:`CN0336 Software User Guide page </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0336>` to find out how to get and how to use the **CN0336 evaluation software**.

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0336** application processes ADC outputs and provide current and voltage values. You can decide how often the ADC measurements take place (see *SCAN_TIME* parameter).

A UART interface (115200 baud rate and 8-bits data length) is used to send the results to terminal window: **input current** value, **voltage** calculation and **ADC code**. If the input value is out of range you get an error message which means that you need to check your settings.

To start displaying data acquisition results on a terminal (putty in this case) you need to press ENTER key (CR) from the keyboard and after that the data are updated every time the input values are changed. The output data are send via UART using semihosting.

The project offers two method to calculate the input current, giving you the possibility to get more accurate results (see :adi:`CN0336 circuit note <cn0336>`). You can use **transfer function** of the circuit which calculate input current based on voltage changed value and circuit gain:

::

       I = Imin + (Vout - Voffset)/Gain

Or you can use the **two-point calibration** method which used the ADC output values for 2 different measurements: first at Imin = 4 mA (ADC1) and second at Imax = 20 mA (ADC2):

::

       Ix = Imin + [(Imax - Imin)/(ADC2 - ADC1)]*(ADCx - ADC1)

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  EVAL-ADICUP360
   -  EVAL-CN0336-PMDZ
   -  4mA - 20mA current source
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADuCM360_demo_cn0336 software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.7.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM36x DFP (1.0.2 or higher)
   -  CMSIS ARM Pack (4.3.0 or higher)
   -  Serial Terminal Program

      -  Such as Putty or Tera Term

Setting up the hardware
-----------------------

-  To program the base board, set the jumpers/switches as shown in the next figure. The important jumpers/switches are highlighted in red.\


|image1|

-  Plug the EVAL-CN0336-PMDZ PMOD in the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board, via the PMOD_SPI port (P4).
-  Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the Debug USB.(P14)

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the CN0336.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

Outputting Data
---------------

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In order to view the data, you must flash the program to the EVAL-ADICUP360.
-  Once complete you will need to switch the USB cable from the DEBUG USB (P14) to the USER USB (P13).
-  Then follow the UART settings below with the serial terminal program.

Following is the UART configuration.

::

     Select COM Port
     Baud rate: 115200
     Data: 8 bit
     Parity: none
     Stop: 1 bit
     Flow Control: none

-  Semihosting must be enables to view the data via the UART
-  The user must press the **<ENTER>** key to beginning transmitting the data to the serial terminal.
-  Data is then updated every time the input values change.
