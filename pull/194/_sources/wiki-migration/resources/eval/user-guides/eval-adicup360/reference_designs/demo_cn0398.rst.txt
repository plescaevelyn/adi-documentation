Soil Measurements for pH and moisture Demo
==========================================

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0398** is a pH and moisture measurements demo project, for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with additional EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ shield, created using the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins in Eclipse environment.

General description
-------------------

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0398** project uses the :adi:`EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ shield <en/design-center/reference-designs/hardware-reference-design/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0398>` which is a single supply, low power, high precision complete solution for soil moisture and pH measurements, including temperature compensation. The circuit is optimized for capacitive soil moisture sensors that are insensitive to water salinity and do not corrode over time. The circuit also measures soil pH so it increases the range of applications where this shield can be used.

The circuit is divided into three independent measurement front ends: pH, soil moisture, and temperature. After signal conditioning, the three channels share an :adi:`ad7124-8`, 24-bit sigma-delta (Σ-Δ) ADC. The :adi:`ad7124-8`, is a low power, low noise, completely integrated analog front end for high precision measurement applications.

|image1| The board offers the possibility to configure **Vin** supply voltage (**P10** connector) in order to use **5V** or **7V-12V**. Considering moisture sensor which is used, the **P8** connector configure **3.3V** or **5V** supply. The user has the possibility to select one of the three GPIOs available for ADC CS pin using **P5** connector (default configuration for P5 is 1-2 position). For temperature compensation can be used an RTD PT100 sensor, 2-wire (this is used in the demo), 3-wire or 4-wire connection (see **P1** connector). For this demo was used for the moisture measurement the *VH400* sensor (**P2**) and for pH measurement *Atlas Scientific* sensor (**J1**). The **DS1** LED is *ON* as long the pH value is measured and calculated and the **DS3** is *ON* as long as the moisture value is measured and calculated. The ADuCM360_demo_cn0398 application processes ADC outputs for all 3 channels (RTD, pH and moisture), calculates pH and moisture values using as input RTD temperature value. Those data are sent to serial interface, usig **UART** communication (**115200** baud rate and **8-bits** data length). The **24-bits** ADC data are received using **SPI** interface of the EVAL-ADICUP360 board.

The **temperature** value is calculated based on the **RTD resistance**:

                                                                  CODE - ADC output
          Rrtd = ((CODE - 2^23)* Rref)/GAIN\*2^23                  Rref - Reference resistor (5kΩ)
                                                                  GAIN - used gain for RTD channel (16)

**1. RTD resistance > 100Ω**

The **pH** value can be calculated in two ways, so user can configure which one did he want for his application: using *two-point calibration* data or using *Nernst equation*. After initialization the user will be asked in the terminal window if he want to perform pH calibration -> in this case the pH value will be calculated using calibration measured value:

::

                                                       y1 - measured voltage at calibration point 1 for known pH
                                                       y2 - measured voltage at calibration point 2 for known pH
           pH = [m*(V -y2 + Voffset) + x2]             x1 - known pH at calibration point 1
                                                       x2 - known pH at calibration point 2
           m  = [(x2-x1)/(y2-y1)]                      V - pH channel measured voltage
                                                       Voffset - Offset voltage

A default calibration package can be loaded (in case is not wanted to perform calibration everytime). For this is needed to update **default_calibration_ph** array with known values before the board is program. In case the *two-point calibration* is not wanted, for pH calculation is used *Nernst equation*:

::

         ph  = [PH_ISO -((V - a) / ((2.303 * AVOGADRO * (T + 273.1))]

         PH_ISO - reference hydrogen ion concentration (7)
         V - pH channel measured voltage
         a - zero point tolerance (see //ZERO_POINT_TOLERANCE// parameter)
         AVOGADRO - Avogadro's number (8.314)
         T - RTD temperature

The **moisture** value can be also calculated in two ways. First way is to use *piece-wise formulas* given by manufacturer (check *USE_MANUFACTURER_MOISTURE_EQ* parameter. For **Vegetronix** may use the follow formulas (*m* - moisture value and *Vm* - moisture channel measured voltage):

================= ======================
**Voltage Range** **Equation**
================= ======================
0V - 1.1V         m = 10 \* Vm - 1
1.1V - 1.3V       m = 25 \* Vm - 17.5
1.3V - 1.82V      m = 48.08 \* Vm - 47.5
1.82V - 2.2V      m = 26.32 \* Vm - 7.89
================= ======================

Otherwise the moisture value can be calculated using *transfer function* for the sensor:

::

   m =-1.18467 + 21.5371\*Vm - 110.996\*Vm^2 + 397.025\*Vm^3 - 666.986\*Vm^4 + 569.236\*Vm^5 -246.005\*Vm^6 + 49.4867\*Vm^7 -3.37077\*Vm^8

-  Connect the **EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ** to the Arduino connectors **P2, P5, P6, P7, P8** of the **EVAL-ADICUP360** board.
-  Connect the pH sensor to the **J1** connector of the EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ.
-  Connect the RTD sensor to the **P1** connector of the EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ.\ :doc:`(see connection details) </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/cn0398>`
-  Connect the moisture sensor to the **P2** connector of the EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ.\ :doc:`(see connection details) </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/cn0398>`

.. important::

   Extremely important to plug in an acceptable power supply to the barrel jack **P11** of the EVAL-ADICUP360 if you are using a moisture sensor that requires voltage excitation greater than 5V on the **EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ**. Only moisture sensors using less than 3.3V can run off the USB power option.


-  Set the jumpers on the **EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ** to the position shown below. FIXME (need picture)
-  Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the Debug USB.(P14)

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the CN0398.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

-  **Terminal refresh** - *DISPLAY_REFRESH* parameter - how often to refresh the output data - input time value in [msec] (*CN0398.h*).
-  **Moisture calculation formula** - *USE_MANUFACTURER_MOISTURE_EQ* parameter - which formula to use in order to calculate the moisture value - commented -> transfer function, uncommented -> manufacturer formulas(*CN0398.h*).

Outputting Data
---------------

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In order to view the data, you must flash the program to the EVAL-ADICUP360.
-  Once complete you will need to switch the USB cable from the DEBUG USB (P14) to the USER USB (P13).
-  Then follow the UART settings below with the serial terminal program.

Following is the UART configuration.

::

     Select COM Port
     Baud rate: 115200
     Data: 8 bit
     Parity: none
     Stop: 1 bit
     Flow Control: none

-  The software will ask if you want to do a calibration, so type in [**n**] or [**y**].
-  If [n] is selected, the software will ask if you would like to load the default configuration, or use the Nernst equations. Select one option.
-  The data output refreshes in the console window at the rate of the "display_refresh" parameter with the following results.
