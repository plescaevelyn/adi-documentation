Weigh Scale Measurement Demo
============================

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0216** is a weigh scale measurement demo project for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with additional :adi:`EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ shield <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ.html>`, created using the CrossCore Embedded Studios Interactive Development Environment(IDE).

General description
-------------------

This project is a good example for how to use :doc:`EVAL-ADICUP360 board </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/base_board>` in different combinations with various shield boards. It expand the list of possible applications that can be done with the base board.

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0216** project uses the :adi:`EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ shield <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ.html>` which is a precision weigh scale system using a **24-bits** sigma-delta converter, and auto-zero amplifiers providing high gain for the bridge sensor input

The CN0216 circuit translates the resistance changes on the bridge into very small voltages. The bridge is excited by a regulated 5V and that determines the full scale range of the bridge output. Those values are passed through very low noise, auto zero amplifiers to remove as many error sources as possible before being gained up to levels that will be compatible with the ADC. The 24-bit ADC value is received via SPI interface of the EVAL-ADICUP360 board.

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0216** application processes ADC output value and make all necessary conversions in order to provide the weight results. A UART interface (9600 baud rate and 8-bits data length) is used to send the results to terminal window: ADC Data Register **codes**, ADC Input Voltage **volts**, and Sensor Input Weight **grams** are the outputs provided in the terminal window.

At the start of the project, a calibration of the upper and lower input range of the weigh scale is taken to remove both offset and gain errors in the circuit, providing the most accurate weigh scale measurements possible. Make sure you open up the serial terminal to your PC in order to do the calibration. Once the program is running, it will ask you to make the zero scale calibration, you **MUST** press <ENTER> to begin the zero scale calibration(takes about 5 seconds). Once that calibration has taken place, the serial terminal will prompt you to add the calibration weight to the scale and then press <ENTER> to make the full scale calibration(again takes about 5 seconds). Those measurements are averaged over 100 samples and then stored into memory as the upper and lower calibration coefficients.

Once calibration is complete, measurements of the output values (weights and conversion information) are displayed every time you press <ENTER> key from the keyboard. Measurements should be between the lower and upper calibration limit can be made at the beginning of the program.

   -  EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ
   -  Precison Weight Set
   -  4- or 6- Wire wheatstone bridge weigh scale ()
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADuCM360_demo_cn0216 software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.7.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM36x DFP (1.0.2 or higher)
   -  CMSIS ARM Pack (4.3.0 or higher)
   -  Serial Terminal Program

      -  Such as Putty or Tera Term

Setting up the hardware
-----------------------

-  To program the base board, set the jumpers/switches as shown in the next figure. The important jumpers/switches are highlighted in red.

   :width: 500px

-  Connect the **EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ** to the Arduino connectors **P2, P5, P6, P7, P8** of the **EVAL-ADICUP360** board.
-  Connect your weigh scale to the EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ via **()**, make sure you pay attention to the pinout which can be found on the :doc:`CN0216 hardware page </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/cn0216>`.
-  Connect an acceptable 7V-12V power supply into the P11 barrel jack of the EVAL-ADICUP360

.. important::

   Extremely important to plug in an acceptable power supply to the barrel jack **P11** for the **EVAL-CN0216-ARDZ**. The boards will not work if you try only to power it from the DEBUG_USB or the USER_USB.


-  Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the Debug USB.(P14)

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the CN0216.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

-  Once complete you will need to switch the USB cable from the DEBUG USB (P14) to the USER USB (P13).
-  Then follow the UART settings below with the serial terminal program.

Following is the UART configuration.

-  At the start of the project, a calibration of the upper and lower input range of the weigh scale is taken to remove both offset and gain errors in the circuit, providing the most accurate weigh scale measurements possible.

-  Make sure you open up the serial terminal to your PC in order to do the calibration. Once the program is running, it will ask you to make the zero scale calibration, you **MUST** press <ENTER> to begin the zero scale calibration(takes about 5 seconds). Make sure there is NOTHING on the scale.

-  Once that calibration has taken place, the serial terminal will prompt you to add the calibration weight to the scale and then press **<ENTER>** to make the full scale calibration(again takes about 5 seconds). Those measurements are averaged over 100 samples and then stored into memory as the upper and lower calibration coefficients.
