Toxic Gas (CO) Measurement Demo
===============================

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0357** is a toxic gas(CO) detector demo project for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with additional :adi:`EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ shield <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ.html>`, created using the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins in Eclipse environment.

General description
-------------------

This project is a good example for how to use :doc:`EVAL-ADICUP360 board </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/base_board>` in different combinations with various shield boards. It expand the list of possible applications that can be done with the base board.

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0357** project uses the :adi:`EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ shield <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ.html>` which is a single-supply, low noise, portable gas detector circuit using an electrochemical sensor.

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ shield <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ.html>` circuit provides a potentiostatic circuit for biasing the electrochemical sensor, along with a programmable TIA and 16-bit Sigma-Delta ADC. The TIA converts the small currents passing in the sensor to a voltage that can be read by the ADC. The 16-bit ADC value is received via SPI interface of the EVAL-ADICUP360 board, where the gas concentration is computed.

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0357** application configures the necessary components, processes ADC output value and make all necessary conversions in order to provide the gas concentration. A UART interface (9600 baud rate and 8-bits data length) is used to send the results to terminal window: ADC Data Register **codes**, ADC Input Voltage **volts**, and Gas Concentration **Parts Per Million(PPM)** are the outputs provided in the terminal window.

At the start of the project, the software computes the necessary parameters and configure the digital rheostat(AD5270) of the TIA. The required parameters are the sensor sensitivity and sensor range. These can be modified by changing the values of the constants **SENSOR_SENSITIVITY** and **SENSOR_RANGE** found in the **CN0357.h** header file of the project. See the "*Project Structure*" section for more details.

Once configuration is complete, the software remains in a loop and continuously reads data from the ADC. Data can be read from a terminal by pressing the **<Enter>** key on the computer's keyboard.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  EVAL-ADICUP360
   -  EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ
   -  Electrochemical Gas Sensor (included with CN0357)
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADuCM360_demo_cn0357 software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.7.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM36x DFP (1.0.2 or higher)
   -  CMSIS ARM Pack (4.3.0 or higher)
   -  Serial Terminal Program

      -  Such as Putty or Tera Term

Setting up the hardware
-----------------------

-  To program the base board, set the jumpers/switches as shown in the next figure. The important jumpers/switches are highlighted in red.

   :align: center
   :width: 500px

-  Connect the **EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ** to the Arduino connectors **P2, P5, P6, P7, P8** of the **EVAL-ADICUP360** board.
-  Connect an acceptable 7V-12V power supply into the P11 barrel jack of the EVAL-ADICUP360

.. important::

   Extremely important to plug in an acceptable power supply to the barrel jack **P11** to supply power for the **EVAL-CN0357-ARDZ**. The boards will not work if you try only to power it from the DEBUG_USB or the USER_USB.


-  Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the Debug USB.(P14)

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the CN0357.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

Configuring the Software Parameters
-----------------------------------

-  **Sensor Range** - SENSOR_RANGE - maximum value of the gas conentration (ppm) that can be detected by the electrochemical gas sensor being used (*CN0357.h*).

::

       #define SENSOR_RANGE     2000

-  **Sensor Sensitivity** - SENSOR_SENSITIVITY - sensitivity (nA/ppm) of the electrochemical sensor being used (*CN0357.h*).

::

Outputting Data
---------------

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In order to view the data, you must flash the program to the EVAL-ADICUP360.
