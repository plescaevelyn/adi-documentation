PMOD Accelerometer Demo
=======================

The **ADuCM360_demo_pmodacl2** is an accelerometer demo project for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with additional PmodACL2 PMOD which is manufactured by Digilent, using the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins in Eclipse environment.

General description
-------------------

This project is an example for how to use :doc:`EVAL-ADICUP360 board </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/base_board>` in combination with the PmodACL2 accelerometer PMOD.

The ADuCM360_demo_pmodacl2 project uses the `PmodACL2 PMOD <http://store.digilentinc.com/pmodacl2-3-axis-mems-accelerometer/>`_ which has the **ADXL362 3-axis MEMS accelerometer** on board.

The application reads the \*\* X \*\* , \*\* Y \*\*, and \*\* Z \*\* acceleration registers. The acceleration in the 3 axis is displayed in **[mG]**. There is also an internal temperature sensor in the ADXL362, which is read and out either in **[C]** or **[codes]**. This is set by changing the **TEMP_ADC** variable within the *main.c* file. (Value of [0] is degrees Celsius, and value [1] is ADC codes) The acceleration range can also be selected by setting the **ADXL_SENSE** variable with the *main.c* file. (Values of [2, 4, and 8 are acceptable] )

All the outputs are printed from the UART to the USER USB port and can be read on the PC using a serial terminal program, such as Putty or Tera Term.

For precision applications, each **ADXL362** chip requires individual calibration which can be done by measuring and setting the definitions // ACC_TEMP_BIAS// and // ACC_TEMP_SENSITIVITY// parameters in the *ADXL362.h* file.

The temperature in degrees celsius, \*\* Treal \*\*, can be derived from the ADC readings \*\* Tadc \*\* using the predefined formula:

::

       Treal = (Tadc + ACC_TEMP_BIAS)/(1 / ACC_TEMP_SENSITIVITY)

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  EVAL-ADICUP360
   -  PmodAcl2
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADuCM360_demo_pmodacl2 software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.7.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM36x DFP (1.0.2 or higher)
   -  CMSIS ARM Pack (4.3.0 or higher)

Setting up the hardware
-----------------------

-  To program the base board, set the jumpers as shown in the next figure. The important jumpers are highlighted in red.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/reference_designs/cn0216_hw_config.png
   :width: 500px

-  Plug the PmodACL2 PMOD in the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board, via the PMOD_SPI port (P4).
-  Power EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the DEBUG USB port (P14).

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the PMODACL2.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

Configuring the Software Parameters
-----------------------------------

Configure the ADXL362 full scale acceleration range in the *main.c* file.

::

   #define ADXL_SENSE        2         /* Values of 2, 4, or 8 are acceptable [g] range */

Configure the temperature units in the *ADXL362.h* file.

::

   #define TEMP_ADC        1        /* 0 for ADC units or 1 for Celsius degrees */

Configure the ADXL362 Calibration Values in the *ADXL362.h* file. These values will vary from sensor to sensor, but these are typical values from the datasheet.

::

   #define ACC_TEMP_BIAS             (float)350
   #define ACC_TEMP_SENSITIVITY      (float)0.065

Set the Accelerometer Scan Time in the *ADXL362.h* file. This is how often you read your axis and temperature data.(in ms)

::

   #define SCAN_SENSOR_TIME   500

In the **src** and **include** folders you will find the source and header files related to pmodacl2 application. You can modify as you wanted those files. The *Communication.c/h* files contain SPI and UART specific data, meanwhile the *ADXL362.c/h* files contain the accelerometer data. Here are parameters you can configure:

The **RTE** folder contains device and system related files:

-  **Device Folder** – contains low levels drivers for ADuCM360 microcontroller.(try not to edit these files)
-  **system.rteconfig** - Allows the user to select the peripherial components they need, along with the startup and ARM cmsis files needed for the project.
