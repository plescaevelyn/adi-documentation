SPI SCLK vs. Cable Length Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following guidelines apply for the direct SPI to RS-485 link designs
(DEMO-CbM-Slave2-Z and DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z). The SPI to RS-485/RS-422 link designs
include a SPI clock transfer over RS-422 (SCLK) and a power over data lines
implementation (phantom power), where data and power share the same twisted pair
(SPI MISO).

**Cable Effects**

-  Over long cable runs the SPI SCLK signal will incur a propagation delay through the cable, of the order of 400-500 ns for a 100 m cable.
-  For a SPI MOSI data transfer from Master to Slave, the MOSI and SCLK are equally delayed by the cable.
-  However, data sent from the slave MISO to the master will be out of sync with
   SPI SCLK by twice the cable propagation delay.

**Maximum SPI SCLK**

-  Is set by the system propagation delay, which includes cable propagation
   delay, and Master + Slave Component propagation delays.

**Minimum SPI SCLK**

-  Is set by the Phantom Power filter components, which high-pass filter data on
   SPI MISO. This technique requires that the data signals being transmitted do
   not have content at DC or at very low frequencies. If operating at higher
   frequencies in the MHz range, it is important to note that a long string of
   logic '1' bits will mean a dynamic effective data rate in the kHz.

\*\* Typical Performance*\*

-  Typical SPI SCLK rate vs. cable length performance in a Phantom Power network
   is characterized in Figure 2. This shows DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z (non-isolated
   slave) and DEMO-CbM-Slave2-Z (isolated slave)error free performance when
   porting the ADcmXL3021 SPI output over cabling.

-  Power supply for the cooling fan

Typical Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps describe a typical setup, as shown in Figure 3, to
communicate over a SPI to RS-485 link using either DEMO-CbM-Slave2-Z or
DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z:

-  Ensure that the following jumper selections are made for the DEMO-CbM-Master-Z: LK8: position A or position B, and LK5 and LK6: Position A. The LK8 jumper needs to be set, but the position is at the user's discretion.
-  Connect the supplied 2-meter RJ50 cable to the J10 RJ50 connector on the DEMO-CbM-Master-Z as indicated in Figure 4. Do not confuse this with the RJ45 connector (J1). Inserting RJ50 cable plugs into RJ45 connectors will damage the plug/connector contacts.
-  Connect the Cypress Evaluation Board CYUSB3KIT-003 as shown in Figure 4 below. J6 and J7 on the DEMO-CbM-Master-Z align with the like-named J6 and J7 on the CYUSB3KIT-003.
-  Connect the supplied 2-meter RJ50 cable to the J10 RJ50 connector on the DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z (or DEMO-CbM-Slave2-Z).
-  Connect the ADcmXL3021 XL module hi-rose connector (male) to the hi-rose connector (female) on the DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z. Refer to Figure 5 for connector orientation. Ensure that Pin1 on both connectors is aligned as shown.
-  Connect the Power Supply to the barrel connector on the DEMO-CbM-Master-Z. The power supply should be set to a minimum of +6 V and a maximum of +12 V. This provides power to both master and slave boards.
-  **Note: the Master board barrel connector is configured for a positive centre tip power supply. For the demo kit power supply –-> connect the positive centre (+) to the positive centre (+) on the small tip adaptors.**
-  Connect the USB 3.0 cable supplied with the CYUSB3KIT-003 to a USB 3.0 port
   on your computer.

.. important::

   You can use the supplied 2 meter RJ50 cable with either the DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z
   or DEMO-CbM-Slave2-Z. However, the 10 meter RJ50 cable can only be used with
   the DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z.

Software Application (GUI)
--------------------------

Software Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two downloads are required, with all software available on the :doc:`ADcmXL3021 wiki </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/adcmxl-pc-eval>`.

-  Download and unzip the file called FX3Driver.zip. Then run the DriverSetup.exe file
-  Download, unzip, and Run the ADCMXL Evaluation Software, version 2.1.8.

.. tip::

   Tip: The ADcmXL3021 wiki also includes detailed software installation and
   troubleshooting instructions.

GUI measurements using Typical Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Open the Vibration Evaluation software version 2.1.8 on your computer.
-  Open the ‘Comm’ menu and select ‘SPI’. Set the SPI SCLK to 2.5 MHz and hit ‘update’.
-  Select Manual Time Capture (MTC) from the Mode Selection drop down menu, and hit the start button.
-  For the Typical setup described in Figure 3 – the X, Y, and Z axis MTC measurements are shown in Figure 6.
-  The corresponding Manual Fast Fourier Transform (MFFT) measurements are shown
   in Figure 7.

.. tip::

   Tip: If the system is unresponsive, or data plots are erroneous, then press
   the S2 pushbutton switch on the DEMO-CbM-Slave2-Z / DEMO-CbM-Slave3-Z to
   reset the ADcmXL3021.

GUI measurements for a non-Repetitive Vibration Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide a more easily visible Manual Time Capture (MTC) of a 'finger tap'
vibration on the top surface of the ADcmXL3021, access the AVG_CNT register as
shown in Figure 8. Write HEX 0x3 to AVG_CNT and perform a read back to confirm
the write. This will decimate the signal so that the MTC waveform can be viewed
easily. Figure 9 shows an example MTC measurement where a 'finger tap' vibration
is applied to the top surface of the ADcmXL3021 module.

LTspice Simulation
------------------

A simplified power over data wires simulation circuit is provided in Figure 10. This circuit uses LTC2862 RS-485 transceiver LTspice macromodels and 1 mH inductors (Wurth 74477830). LTspice includes real inductor models, which include device parasitics, enabling closer correlation between simulation and real design performance. The DC blocking capacitor values are 10 µF. In general, using larger inductor and capacitor values enable a lower data rate performance on the communication network. The simulated test case is a 250 kHz data rate, which roughly corresponds to 100 meters of cabled communication when porting clock synchronised SPI over an RS-485 interface. The input voltage waveform used in the simulation corresponds to a worst-case dc content, with a 16-bit word and all logic high bits. Simulation results are presented in Figures 11 and 12. The input voltage waveform (VIN) matches the output at the remote powered device (no communication errors). Figure 12 presents a zoomed-in view of the bus voltage differential waveform (voltage A – voltage B) for droop analysis. The voltage at the remote sensor node, extracted from the L2 inductor (V(pout)) provides a power supply rail of 5V±1mV.

The VDROOP, VPEAK, and TDROOP are measured using the Figure 11 and 12 LTspice
waveform. The L and C values are then calculated using equations 2 and 4. It
depends where you measure on the waveform, however, the calculated L value is 1
to 3mH as shown in Table 1. Measuring at point X (Figure 12) is most accurate
and yields the correct inductance value of approximately 1 mH. The high pass
filter frequency (equation 6) is simply a function of the droop time and
voltage, and for point X is approximately equates to 250 kHz/32 for 1 bit (half
clock cycle), which matches the input waveform (V3) shown in the Figure 10
schematic.

**Table 1**

|image12|

When simulating Figure 10 it is also worth noting that the C8 capacitor is
recommended to reduce voltage overshoot at the sensor (Vpout at power extraction
node). With C8 added the overshoot is maximum 47mV and settles to within 1mV of
the desired 5VDC within 1.6ms. Simulating without a C8 capacitor results in an
underdamped system, with 600mV overshoot, and a permanent 100mV of voltage
oscillation from the 5V dc target.
