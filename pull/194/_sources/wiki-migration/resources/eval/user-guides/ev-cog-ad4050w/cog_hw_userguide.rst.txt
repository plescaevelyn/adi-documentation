Power
-----

The MCU Cog board offers flexibility in terms of power supply and power muxing
options. This is achieved with the use of jumpers on the board. The Cog board
also offers multiple test points for monitoring current consumption.

Power Supply Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCU Cog offers the following power supply options:

::

   -5V USB power (USB microB connector)
   -3V CR2032 Coin cell (Cell holder - BT1)
   -3V - 6V Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery (JST Connector - P6)
   -3V - 6V External Supply from an MCU Cog Add-on card (via Connector C1)

Power Muxing Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For details of the power muxing scheme, refer to the figure below.

.. danger::

   Do not insert shunt b/w positions 5 & 6 of JH4 when using USB supply. Doing
   so can permanently damage this board.

.. tip::

   Refer to the *Jumper Settings* section further below for details on power related jumpers on the board

Power Regulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCU Cog board uses an on-board switching regulator - the :adi:`ADP5300 <en/products/power-management/switching-power-converters/switching-regulators/adp5300.html>`, which is a high efficiency, ultra-low power step down regulator. The MCU has complete control over the switching modes of the regulator via GPIO. The pin-mapping is shown in the table below.

Current Measurement Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCU Cog enables IOT developers to measure and profile current consumption at
different places on the board to enable isolation of current consumption
hotspots. The current measure test points shown in the table below can be used
along with a digital multimeter to profile current consumption.

Programming & Debug Options
---------------------------

The MCU Cog offers the following debug options:

::

   -On-board CMSIS-DAP debugger (USB microB connector)
   -JLINK-9 Connector for access to SWD interface (P26)
   -Access to SW interface to an MCU Cog Add-on card (via Connector C2)

Wireless Connectivity Options
-----------------------------

The MCU Cog board offers support for ADI RF daughter-cards such as the EV-ADF70301-915AZ via the "EV-COG-BLEINTP1" connectivity Cog board that can be attached at Connector P2. This connectivity Cog board also has on-board BTLE circuit enabling the MCU Cog board to use BTLE communication as well. More details regarding wireless connectivity options are available on the :doc:`EV-COG-BLEINTP1 Wiki page </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ev-cog-bleintp1z>`.

.. important::

   UART1 is wired to RF Module. If an application wants to use UART1 for some
   purpose other than RF module, then RF Module cannot be used.

Differences between EV-COG-AD4050LZ and EV-COG-AD4050WZ
-------------------------------------------------------

::

   -LFXTAL changed to a smaller footprint version
   -Instead of UART0 being brought to the RF, UART1 is always wired to the RF module (32-pin Hirose connector).
   -If an application needs to use UART1 as well, the RF module may not be used at the same time.
   -As a larger number of GPIOs are attached to the expansion connector (as given in the spreadsheet), the ADF_GPIOs from the RF module connector and RF_RTC_OPC1 are not available on the expansion headers.
   -LED2 is on GPIO47 instead of earlier GPIO42 (as GPIO42 is not available), where there was GPIO42 earlier on the expansion pin header, now there is GPIO47.

Buttons/LED(s)
--------------

The MCU Cog offers 2 buttons and 2 LED(s) that can be used by the Application.
The default GPIO connections are shown in the tables below.

Expansion Connectors
--------------------

One of the USP of the MCU Cog is access to ALL GPIO via Expansion Connectors
("C1" and "C2") for an Add-on card to utilize in its Application. This enables
developers to confidently build final form factor hardware without having to
worry about porting their firmware. The figures below capture the pin-mapping
and jumpers that need to be changed to get external access (via the expansion
connectors) to GPIO (as well as power/reset, etc).

Jumper Settings
---------------

The MCU Cog offers flexibility in terms of power muxing options and the facility
to route any GPIO externally via the expansion connectors "C1" and "C2". This is
achieved with the use of jumpers. The MCU Cog has two types of jumpers - those
labelled "JHx" and which are 2x2 1.27mm pitch headers and those labelled "JPx"
and which are solder jumpers. The "JHx" jumpers are expected to be used more
frequently than the "JPx" jumpers.

Jumper locations on board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following image of the bottom layer of the PCB highlights the jumper
positions on the board:

Note that the jumpers JH6 and JP16 on the **top** layer of the board.

Changing the jumper settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shunt Jumpers (JHx)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above, the shunt jumpers are 1.27mm headers, whose pins are shorted
using a shunt. This shunt is inserted by default in the positions as mentioned
in the table above.

To change a jumper setting, carefully remove the shunt from its position, and
re-insert the shunt in the correct position corresponding to the pin numbers to
be shorted. The pin numbers are mentioned on the silkscreen of the PCB (usually
both pin 1 & 2) and thus the default positions can be located.

For example JH11 controls which signal is sent to the RTC1_SS2 SensorStrobe pin.
By default the ADXL_362_INT2 signal is connected to the SensorStrobe pin. In
order to connect the RF module, JH11 needs to be moved from "1 and 2" to "3 and
4". The corresponding change is shown below:

   :alt: Shunt Jumper Change
   :align: center

Solder Jumpers (JPx)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Solder jumpers are shorted using a solder blob. There are 16 such jumpers on the
board, out of which 15 are on the bottom side of the board while 1 (JP16) is on
the top side of the board. Positions 1, 2 and 3 are usually indicated along the
jumpers.

To change a solder jumper, using a hot soldering iron, melt the blob of solder
and move it into the desired position (1-2 or 3-2 or 4-2).

For example, GPIO30 is connected to the on board ADT7420 temperature sensor by
default. In order to bring it out to the expander JP3 needs to be shifted from
1-2 to 2-3. Using a soldering iron to shift the jumpers, this is how it looks
before and after:
