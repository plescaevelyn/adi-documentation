EVAL-CN0410-ARDZ Shield Demo
============================

:adi:`CN0410` is an Arduino compatible shield that is optimized for smart agriculture to control current passing through LED's. The :adi:`CN0410` is used along the the CFTL-LED Bar that has LED's with specific wavelengths that plants utilize.

The circuit shown below is a complete 3-channel single-supply, 16-bit unbuffered
voltage output DAC that maintains ±2 LSB integral and differential nonlinearity
by utilizing a CMOS DAC. This circuit has a voltage to current conversion that
controls the amount of current passing through an LED by using a MOSFET in its
configuration. The circuit also has an isoSPI repeater that allows multiple
boards to be controlled with a single master.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  EVAL-ADICUP3029
   -  EVAL-CN0410-ARDZ
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADICUP3029_demo_CN0410 software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.6.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM302x DFP (2.0.0 or higher)
   -  ADICUP3029 BSP (1.0.0 or higher)
   -  Serial Terminal Program (Required for running in release mode only)

      -  Such as Putty or Tera Term

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

Chip Select
~~~~~~~~~~~

The chip select pin of the AD5686 is hardware configurable and routed to 3
general purpose I/O pins on the board. Use the table below to change the
location of the chip select simply by moving the shunt on P21, and ensuring the
software is configured the same way. By default the chip select is located on
GPIO 8. This feature allows multiple boards using SPI communications protocol to
be stacked on top of each other.

================= ==========
Chip Select (P21) GPIO (P16)
================= ==========
Pins 1 & Pin 2    GPIO 8
Pins 3 & Pin 4    GPIO 9
Pins 5 & Pin 6    GPIO 10
================= ==========

Configuring the Software
------------------------

The software for EVAL-CN0410 does not require any particular configurations in order to setup the application. The only setting that the user could make would be the selection of the CS pin. This can be done by modifying the **SYNC_PORT** and **SYNC_PIN** inside **adi_cn0410.h**.

::

   #define SYNC_PORT   ADI_GPIO_PORT1 //this is the CS pin
   #define SYNC_PIN    ADI_GPIO_PIN_12

Outputting Data
---------------

After the application starts the user can send commands to set the output of the
DAC channels. Available commands:

-  set_a value
-  set_b value
-  set_c value
-  set_zero - resets all channels to 0

The value can be between 0 and 65535.

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the hardware and software is configured, user needs to follow on screen
instructions to run EVAL-CN0410 demo.

Following is the UART configuration.

::

     Select COM Port
     Baud rate: 9600
     Data: 8 bit
     Parity: none
     Stop: 1 bit
     Flow Control: none

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the
CN0410.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the Daplink drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.
