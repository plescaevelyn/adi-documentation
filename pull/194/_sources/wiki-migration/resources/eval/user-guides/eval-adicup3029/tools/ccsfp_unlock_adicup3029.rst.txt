Unlocking a "Bricked" ADICUP3029
================================

Problem Statement
-----------------

Occasionally when you are debugging a new program or loading a pre-built .HEX or .BIN file using the ADICUP3029, the board can get stuck and becomes unusable(commonly known as "bricked"). This can happen because the code is in an endless loop, hard fault occurs, or other mistakes that make it so the board becomes unresponsive.

The good thing is there is a way to recover your hardware from this condition!

How to Recover the ADICUP3029
-----------------------------

-  Download and install :adi:`CrossCore Serial Programmer <en/design-center/processors-and-dsp/evaluation-and-development-software/crosscore-utilities.html#relatedsoftware>`
-  Plug in the micro USB cable into P10 of the EVAL-ADICUP3029 board
-  Plug the other end of the USB cable into the computers USB port
-  Open up the CrossCore Serial Programmer tool
-  Change the parameters of the utility to the following settings:(see image below)

   -  "Target" = ADuCM302x
   -  "Serial Port" = COM X (mbed Serial Port)
   -  "Baudrate" = 9600
   -  "Action" = Erase
