CN0401 SPI to CAN FD Transceiver Demo
=====================================

The **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0401** project provides a solution to adding isolated fieldbus communication to a microcontroller circuit. The project demonstrates basic CAN FD communication, transmission and response to the ISO11898-2:2016 remote wake-up pattern, and control of switchable termination circuitry. The example code is written for the **EVAL-ADICUP3029** development platform to control the **EVAL-ADM3055E-ARDZ** daughter board over the SPI bus interface. The daughter boards main component is the :adi:`ADM3055E <en/products/adm3055e.html>`, an isolated signal and power CAN FD transceiver with integrated auxiliary channel.

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0401** project uses the **EVAL-ADM3055E-ARDZ** to provide CAN FD bus connectivity to underlying development board that it may be added to an existing CAN FD bus as another node. This example demonstrates the **EVAL-ADM3055E-ARDZ** circuit features using two nodes, each a **EVAL-ADM3055E-ARDZ** and **EVAL-ADICUP3029** development board.

The node is at first in low power mode by putting the CAN controller and transceiver to standby mode. The user can then issue a command to transmit an ASCII message on the bus. the message is repeated for 5 seconds or until it is acknowledged by another node, then the transmitting node goes to standby. If the system receives a message, particularly the slower baud rate arbitration phase, it wakes up, receives the message and displays it on the CLI terminal, then goes back to standby. A node not connected to a CAN bus can also run a self-test routine on the command of the user, in which it transmits and receives a message in loopback mode and displays a PASS of FAIL message. The initial baud rate is 500KHz for the arbitration phase and 2MHz for the data phase and the application acknowledges messages with the **Standard ID (SID)** of 0x300. The **SID** can be changed by user commands.

The application is controlled by the user with a CLI implemented using the serial UART core in the ADuCM3029 controller. The CLI is displayed on a connected PC using a serial terminal connection.

The program is divided in 2 parts: the setup part in which the present module is discovered and the main process.


|Main flow chart|

To replicate the CAN FD bus described in the example both boards need to be connected to each other via the P1 or P4 connectors on the board and each in turn connected to the Arduino form factor headers of the ADICUP3029. Then each ADICUP3029 needs to be connected to the PC via USB to provide serial terminal CLI interface for each node.

   :align: center

-  Connect a micro-USB cable to P10 connector of each of the the EVAL-ADICUP3029 boards and connect them to a computer.

Configuring the Software
------------------------

Most of the configuration parameters can be found in the CAN controller API module. The CAN controller API will instantiate a handler that will determine the initial configuration of the node. The handler is instantiated by the initialization structure with the following form:

::

   struct can_ctrl_init_param {
       struct spi_init_param can_ctrl_spi_init;
       bool con_iso_crc_en;
       bool con_store_in_tef_en;
       bool con_txq_en;
       uint8_t tef_fifo_size; /* Number of messages in TEF FIFO*/
       bool tef_time_stamp_en;
       enum can_ctrl_fifo_plsize txq_plsize;
       uint8_t txq_fifo_size; /* Number of messages in TXQ FIFO */
       uint8_t txq_tx_priority; /* 0 is lowest; 0x1f is highest */

       uint8_t tx_fifo_nr;
       enum can_ctrl_fifo_plsize tx_fifo_plsize;
       uint8_t tx_fifo_size; /* Number of messages in FIFO */
       uint8_t tx_fifo_priority; /* 0 is lowest; 0x1f is highest */

       uint8_t rx_fifo_nr;
       enum can_ctrl_fifo_plsize rx_fifo_plsize;
       uint8_t rx_fifo_size; /* Number of messages in FIFO */
       bool rx_fifo_tsen;

       uint8_t rx_flt_nr;
       uint16_t rx_sid_addr;

       enum can_ctrl_nominal_bitrate can_nbt;
       enum can_ctrl_data_bitrate can_dbt;
       enum can_ctrl_ssp_mode ssp_mode;
   };

The following is a non-exhaustive list that contains the most important parameters and their values:

-  **can_dbt** - Data bit rate; values are contained into the following enum:

<code> enum can_ctrl_data_bitrate {

::

     BITRATE_DBT_500K,
     BITRATE_DBT_833K,
     BITRATE_DBT_1M,
     BITRATE_DBT_1M5,
     BITRATE_DBT_2M,
     BITRATE_DBT_3M,
     BITRATE_DBT_4M,
     BITRATE_DBT_5M,
     BITRATE_DBT_6M7,
     BITRATE_DBT_8M,
     BITRATE_DBT_10M

}; </code>

-  **can_nbt** - Nominal bit rate; values are contained into the following enum:

<code> enum can_ctrl_nominal_bitrate {

::

     BITRATE_NBT_125K,
     BITRATE_NBT_250K,
     BITRATE_NBT_500K,
     BITRATE_NBT_1M

}; </code>

-  **rx_fifo_nr** - Number of the FIFO that will function as a RX FIFO. Between 1 and 31 when using TXQ and 0 and 31 hen not using TXQ.
-  **rx_fifo_plsize** - Payload size for input messages. CAN FD supports up to 64 bytes.
-  **rx_fifo_size** - Number of messages that will trigger an interrupt. Set to 1 to interrupt after every message.
-  **rx_fifo_tsen** - Enable/Disable timestamp for messages received in this FIFO.
-  **rx_flt_nr** - ID of the input filter active for this FIFO. can be between 0 and 7.
-  **rx_sid_addr** - SID value of the input filter. Only messages that contain this specific SID will be received in the attached FIFO. Can be between 0 and 0x3FF.
-  **tx_fifo_nr** - Number of the FIFO that will function as a TX FIFO. Between 1 and 31 when using TXQ and 0 and 31 hen not using TXQ.
-  **tx_fifo_plsize** - Payload size for output messages. CAN FD supports up to 64 bytes.
-  **tx_fifo_size** - Number of messages that need to be setup before transmission starts. Set to 1 to interrupt after every message.

These parameters can be changed in the **can_ctrl_get_config** function from the **can_obj_layer.c** file.

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the CN0401.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the Daplink drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.
