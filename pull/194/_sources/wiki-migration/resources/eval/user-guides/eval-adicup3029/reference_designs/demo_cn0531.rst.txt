AD5791 PMOD Application with EVAL-ADICUP3029 (w/ EVAL-CN0531-ADRZ)
==================================================================

The **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0531** project provides a solution to control a AD5791 DAC PMOD using the **EVAL-ADICUP3029**. The **AD5791** is a high precision, 1ppm, voltage output **DAC** that can be controlled in this application using a serial UART CLI connected to a host PC.

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

:adi:`EVAL-CN0531-PMDZ <CN0531>` is a minimalist 1 **ppm**, 20-Bit, ±1 **LSB INL**, **DAC SPI PMOD** board suitable for medical instrumentation, test and measurement equipment, industrial control or high end scientific and aerospace instrumentation. Multiple voltage references and power options are available to adapt this module depending on the application. With this module, the user is capable to use the onboard positive voltage reference or to connect external references.

The **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0531** project uses this PMOD with the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` board to bring up the **DAC**, control it's internal registers and control it's voltage output. This control is done using a minimalist **CLI** interface enabled over the **UART** controller of the board. This **CLI** can be used by a host **PC** connected via **USB** cable to the system.

Note that the 'do' command for setting the output voltage works on the assumption that the on board 5V reference is used.

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the CN0531.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the Daplink drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST way to get started with the reference design

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

The software for the **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0531** can be found here:

How to use the Tools
--------------------

The official tool we promote for use with the EVAL-ADICUP3029 is CrossCore Embedded Studio. For more information on downloading the tools and a quick start guide on how to use the tool basics, please check out the :doc:`Tools Overview page. </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/tools>`

Project Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The program is composed of two main parts:

-  Board setup with initial values.
-  Main process.

   :alt: Main flow chart
   :align: center

Board setup initializes UART and SPI communications and sets the DAC value register to 0. The DAC RBUF bit is also set to 0 to provide the widest voltage range for the application. The DAC output will be between -5V and 5V and coded in two's complement. The coding can be changed to offset binary and the 'do' CLI command will take that into consideration, as it will also take into consideration the RBUF bit. If the RBUF is changed to narrow the output field to 0V - 5V the coding will not change. As such the 0x00000 value of the DAC register will correspond to the middle range value of 2.5V. If not using the 'do' command to change the output, this will have to be taken into consideration.
