ADICUP3029 PC/Laptop Drivers
============================

When connecting up the ADICUP3029 to your computer or laptop, all the necessary
drivers are automatically located and loaded up when using Windows operating
systems.

There are two sets of drivers that get installed on your computer depending on
which mode of operation the ADICUP3029 emulator comes up.

.. important::

   It EXTREMELY important to ensure that all drivers are installed, before
   trying to use the ADICUP3029 with the CrossCore Embedded Tools. So when you
   see that the drivers are being installed in the task bar, open it up and wait
   till everything finished before progressing.

Mass Storage Drives
-------------------

DAPLINK Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the ADICUP3029 emulator is connected to the ADuCM3029 and ready for
program/debug mode, the "DAPLINK" drive is displayed on your computer.

This mode allows users to drag and drop (or copy and paste) a .BIN or .HEX
[Intel formatted] file directly into the DAPLINK drive, and that file will be
flashed directly to the ADuCM3029. This means you don't have to use the tools or
the debugger to program your board, making this very useful in production
releases or updating applications already in the field.

-  The PC will start searching for and install the following drivers:(if not
   already complete)

-  Then go to the **My Computer** view and search for the DAPLINK drive, if you see this then the drivers are complete and correct.

-  After that simply drag and drop (or copy and paste) your .BIN or .HEX [Intel
   formatted] file to the DAPLINK drive, and your ADICUP3029 board will be
   programmed.

   -  Your Windows Explorer browser will close automatically

-  You will need to press the 3029_RESET button (S1) in order for the program to
   update

   -  Alternatively you could unplug the micro USB cable from the USB port (P10)
      of the EVAL-ADICUP3029, and then reconnect it.

Maintenance Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the ADICUP3029 emulator is connected to the MK20DX128VFM5 (by holding down
the "3029_RESET" button while connecting the USB port (P10) to the PC/laptop)
the "Maintenance" drive is displayed on your computer. This mode allows a user
to overwrite the ADuCM0329 interface file within the emulator. This allows for
patches and updates to the firmware on the emulator.

-  The PC will start searching for and install the following drivers:(if not
   already complete)

-  After that simply drag and drop (or copy and paste) the latest interface file
   to the Maintenance drive, and your ADICUP3029 board will be updated with the
   latest interface file.

   -  Your Windows Explorer browser will close automatically

-  Unplug the micro USB cable from the USB port (P10) of the EVAL-ADICUP3029,
   and then reconnect the USB cable to the USB port (P10) to “reboot” the board.
