PLC Arduino Shield Output Demo
==============================

The **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0418** project provides a solution to control a **PLC** or **DCS** output system using the **EVAL-CN0418-ARDZ** and the **EVAL-ADICUP3029**. It uses a DAC with 4 channels that can be configured as either voltage or current output and is compatible with **HART** modem output to enable **HART** communication on any channel. It has a 32kb EEPROM memory that can also be used to identify the board and is controlled via a command line interface (CLI).

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The **EVAL-CN0418-ARDZ** is an Arduino compatible shield includes a **AD5755-1** (quad channel voltage and current output DAC with dynamic power control) and the **AD5700-1 HART modem**, to give a completely isolated multiplexed **HART** analog output solution.

The **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0418** application uses different software modules to deliver a CLI interface that can be used to set any channel range or output and transmit and receive **HART** messages on any of those channels. It uses SPI to communicate with the **AD5755-1**, to read and write its registers. The channle code and range registers can be set as well as the RSET register. It can function both in voltage and current mode.

The current mode is used with the **AD5700-1 HART modem** to transmit and receive **HART** messages. The application can send command zero and then receive and interpret the result. The receiving is done asynchronous through the use of GPIO group interrupts featured by the **ADuCM3029**. The maximum baudrate of the **HART** communication is 1200 and is implemented by a **software UART**. It transmits and receives data bytes of 8 bits with one stop bit and one parity bit, using odd parity.

The **CLI** is implemented using the hardware UART module in the **ADuCM3029** and can work up 115200 baudrate.

   -  Serial Terminal Program

      -  Such as Putty or Tera Term

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

-  Connect **EVAL-CN0418-ARDZ** to the **EVAL-ADICUP3029**.
-  Set the jumpers into the position shown below. This is the standard position and only works for one board systems.

-  Connect a micro-USB cable to **P10** connector of the **EVAL-ADICUP3029** and connect it to a computer.
-  Connect the 24V power source to the **P1** connector with the ground wire to pin 2 and 24V wire to pin 3. The final setup should look similar to the picture below.

Configuring the Software
------------------------

The software needs no configuration beyond the CLI UART baudrate, and HART UART parity and number of bits. These can be accessed in the ADuCM3029_demo_cn0418.c file in the main function, but usually the default values work best.
