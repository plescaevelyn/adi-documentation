Smart Greenhouse Demo
=====================

The **Smart Greenhouse** is a WI-FI cloud enabled or local serial terminal application for the **EVAL-ADICUP3029** base board with additional Soil shield **EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ**, Light shield **EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ**, LED shield **EVAL-CN0410-ARDZ** created with Analog Devices Cross Core Embedded Studio.

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The Smart Greenhouse project uses the soil shield **EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ** to collect data about temperature, moisture and pH, the **EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ** to get information about light intensity and concentration for red, blue and green light and the **EVAL-CN0410-ARDZ** to control a led array to get the desired light intensity.

The **EVAL-ADICUP3029** is designed for IOT (Internet of Things) applications in mind, and therefore comes with on board Wi-Fi **ESP8266** module.

In order to fully make use of IOT cloud connectivity, the Arrow SDK or IBM
Watson is used to connect to cloud services and have and interface to receive
data and send commands.

Demo Versions Supported
-----------------------

There are a few demo versions supported using the same algorithm and application
level code. The only difference for each of these options is how you would view
the data and interact with the design.

-  IBM Watson Smart Greenhouse
-  PC Command Line Smart Greenhouse

   :align: center
   :width: 900

-  The ESP8266 Enable Pin needs to be tied directly to 3.3V or pulled high to
   the GPIO via a 10K ohm resistor. Because this is not currently on the Rev B
   or Rev C version of the ADICUP3029, you will need to solder a small fly wire
   from the 3.3V pin to the enable pin.
   |image1| |image2|
   \* Plug the **ESP8266** in the **P1** connector on the **EVAL-ADICUP3029**.
-  Configure the EVAL-CN0398-ARDZ CS option by setting the pin jumper of **P5** to **pin 1** and **2**. Set **P8** moisture power supply to **3V3** and **VIN** Supply to **5V**.

IBM Watson Smart Greenhouse Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the IBM
Watson Smart Greenhouse.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the Daplink drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

The software for the **ADuCM3029_IBMWatson_Greenhouse** can be found here:

Configuring Software for IBM Watson Greenhouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will describe the steps needed to get the IBM Watson Greenhouse up
and running.

Creating an IBM Watson account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to get an IBM account for IoT projects. Acces this link https://www.ibm.com/cloud/#/ibmssolanding and click Sign Up.

|image3|

After login you will arrive at the dashboard page.

|image4|

Choose to create a resource and select the Internet of Things platform.

|image5|

Give the resource a Service name and create it. After this the last step is to
launch the resource.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/reference_designs/ibm_launch.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

Create a device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The next now is to create a device inside IBM Watson in order to recognize our
physical device. Click on the Devices option from the side tab.

|image6|

**To add the device please follow this tutorial** https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/how-to-register-devices-in-ibm-iot-foundation/

Setting WIFI connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to establish the connection to the **WIFI** we have to set the **aWifiSSID** and **aWifiPassword** to connect to the access point (wifi router). This is done modifying **ADuCM3029_IBMWatson.h**.

|image7|

Establishing the connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last step is to connect our device to the IBM platform. There still are few fields in **ADuCM3029_IBMWatson.h** that need to be completed.

First let's set the MQTT username and password. The username is always **use-token-auth**. For the password use the **Authentication token** when you created the device in the tutorial above.

|image8|

The last step is to set the MQTT configuration. The broker ip is the same as you IBM Watson IoT platform link. it should be something similar to this **0qqrd7.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com** where 0qqrd7 is the Organization ID. Replace the address from **ADuCM3029_IBMWatson.h**, **aMQTTBrokerIp** with your own. The port is always 1883.

The publisher name is composed of **d:OrganizationID:ClientName:DeviceName** in the end you end up with something like **d:0qqrd7:C_Client:ADI_GreenHouse**.

The final thing to do is set the Topic name and the Subscribe Topic. We will
need the subscribe topic to send commands to the device from an application. An
example is to create a NodeRed application and connect it to the cloud. This
will enable us to send commands to the device. But first lets set those two
things we mentioned earlier.

-  **Compose the Topic name**: **iot-2/evt/DeviceID/fmt/json** in our case we have d:0qqed7:C_Client:ADI_GreenHouse
-  **Compose Subscribe topic**: **iot-2/cmd/DeviceID/fmt/json** this is you subscribe topic iot-2/cmd/ADI_GreenHouse_cmd/fmt/json

For an application creation you will need to create a Node Red starter pack inside IBM following this link https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/node-red-starter |image9| Click on **visit App URL** then just go to Node Red Editor. This is an application example using Node Red dashboard pack. |image10| For more documentation on NodeRed just visit https://nodered.org/ and follow the documentation.

The greenhouse application involves 4 layers:

-  Hardware, arduino shields layer
-  Communication layer (SPI communication)
-  Processing layer (ADICUP3029 and ESP8266)
-  Cloud layer

The hardware part is composed of the shields stacked on top of each other, which
provide data from the sensors and also control the leds. For more details about
these CNs you can consult the individual page for each one:

-  :doc:`CN0398 </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/cn0398>`
-  :doc:`CN0397 </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/cn0397>`
-  :doc:`CN0410 </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/hardware/cn0410>`

The communication layer configures the shields and is responsible for
transferring information from and to the desired device. Data is then available
for processing and transmitting to the cloud.

ADICUP3029 ensures the logic for the localized operations while the ESP8266
establishes the connection to the cloud and send the data over WIFI.

Output Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data from the device can be visualized inside the IBM Watson IoT platform. Just
navigate to devices and click on the one you created.

|image11|

Also can be visualized in nodeRed with the dashboard pack. This will create a
more visual way is displaying data.

Configuring Serial Terminal Software for Smart Greenhouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The serial greenhouse project is a local deployed solution. It does not use WIFI
connection and all communication is done over UART.

The communication layer configures the shields and is responsible for
transferring information from and to the desired device. Data is then available
for processing and transmitting to the cloud.

ADICUP3029 ensures the logic for all the operations and once the data is
available, it is being sent over UART and made available for the user. The user
can also send commands to the device to control the leds intensity.

Output Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data is represented in json format and sent over UART. Use a **Putty** service set to **9600** baud rate.

|image13|

After sending a command we can read again the values of the sensors to see the
intensity change.

|image14|
