ADXL372 Demo using Bluetooth
============================

This demo will use **EVAL-ADXL372-ARDZ** along with **EVAL-ADICUP3029** to create a impact measurement application. The **ADXL372** is an ultralow power, 3-axis, **±200 g** MEMS accelerometer.

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The ADXL372 demo project uses the **EVAL-ADXL372-ARDZ** shield which has an ADXL372 accelerometer. The ADXL372 is configured to operate in "Instant On" mode which means that the device is powered down, until the sensor records an impact event that triggers a threshold. Once that level is surpassed, the ADXL372 automatically goes into measurement mode to capture the rest of the impact event.

The **EVAL-ADICUP3029** is designed for IOT (Internet of Things) applications in mind, and therefore comes with on board **Bluetooth 5.0** module. The ADuCM3029 is placed in "Plexi" mode, to optimize it's ultra low power consumption and can only be woken up from an external interrupt that comes from the ADXL372 impact sensor. At that point the ADuCM3029 is placed into full power mode to do the other application tasks necessary, before being placed back into "Plexi" mode.

The data is sent via Bluetooth 5.0 link to an iOS smart device, where all the
max impact data can be read.

Both boards and all components are used in their respective low power modes to
optimize the solutions battery life.

-  Place the **EVAL-ADXL372-ARDZ-INT** on top of the **EVAL-ADICUP3029**.
-  Make sure the jumpers **P10, P11, P12** are configured exactly as the picture below.

   -  P10 -> Pin 1-2
   -  P11 -> Pin 1-2
   -  P12 -> Pin 1-2

   :width: 800

-  Plug in the micro USB cable into the (P10) USB port on the EVAL-ADICUP3029,
   and the other end into the PC or laptop.

Configuring the Software
------------------------

For this application you will need to install on your :doc:`IOS </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/smart_app/ios_app>` or `Android <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/smart_app/android_app>`_ device one of these apps.

Outputting Data
---------------

The data from the accelerometer will be sent over Bluetooth but can also be viewed using a **UART connection**.

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To establish connection over UART, a micro USB cable connected to the board and a serial console program like `Putty <http://www.putty.org/>`_ are required.

Following is the UART configuration.

::

     Select COM Port
     Baud rate: 9600
     Data: 8 bit
     Parity: none
     Stop: 1 bit
     Flow Control: none

Smart Device Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open up the IoTNode app on your Smart Phone or Tablet.

Just press the Scan button on the bottom left corner in order for the app to
start searching for Bluetooth devices.

After connecting to the device and generating enough G acceleration(**minimum of 10 G** on any axis), information will be displayed on the application. To generate this high value of acceleration you can try and hit the board on your hand ( do not put to much force in order to avoid damages to the device ).

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the
ADXL372.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the Daplink drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

The project is structured in 3 layers:

-  Hardware layer - ADXL372
-  Communication layer
-  Application layer - ADuCM3029 and EM9304 BLE

The ADXL372 transmits data to ADuCM3029 controller through the Communication
layer. The data is processed and sent over BLE to a mobile device.
