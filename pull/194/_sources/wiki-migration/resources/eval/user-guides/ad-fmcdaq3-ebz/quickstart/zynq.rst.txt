.. important::

   The ZC706 is build around a XC7Z045 FFG900 – 2 FPGA, which means the design will be overclocked when configured for 1233MSPS. In a production design a XC7Z045 FFG900 –3 FPGA should be used or the lane rate should be within the supported range for the specific FPGA.

Requirements
------------

-  You need a Host PC (Windows or Linux).
-  You need a SD card writer connected to above PC (Supported USB SD readers/writers are OK).
-  USB keyboard/mouse for the Zynq or ZED Device
-  HDMI Display (monitor or TV) (FULL HD only!)

- Learn more about the :doc:`IIO Scope </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`.
   * You are done. You can interact with the GUI either over the network, or
     with the HDMI monitor/USB keyboard mouse.

.. important::

   Even thought this is Linux, this is a persistent file systems. Care should be
   taken not to corrupt the file system -- please shut down things, don't just
   turn off the power switch. Depending on your monitor, the standard power off
   could be hiding. You can do this from the terminal as well with

   
   ``sudo shutdown -h now``
