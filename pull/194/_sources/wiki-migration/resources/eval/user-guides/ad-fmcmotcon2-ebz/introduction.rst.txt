ADI FMC Motor Drive System v2 Introduction
==========================================

**The ADI FMC motor drive v2 solution consist of the following products**

-  :doc:`AD-FMCMOTCON2-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcmotcon2-ebz/hardware/controller_board>` - Controller board. Compatible with all Xilinx FPGA platforms with FMC LPC or HPC connectors.
-  :doc:`AD-DRVLV2-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcmotcon2-ebz/hardware/lv_board>` - Low voltage drive board. Connects to the Controller board and has a power stage that can drive Brushed DC / BLDC / PMSM / Stepper motors up to 48V and 20A.
-  :doc:`AD-DYNO2-EBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcmotcon2-ebz/hardware/dyno>` - Dynamometer drive system. Acts as an electronically adjustable load with two BLDC motors connected in a dyno setup.
