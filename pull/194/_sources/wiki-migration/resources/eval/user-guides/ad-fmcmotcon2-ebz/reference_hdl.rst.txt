Xilinx HDL Reference Design
===========================

The Reference design is based on the `ZedBoard <http://zedboard.org/product/zedboard>`_. It has the complete infrastructure for Linux support.

Reference Design
----------------

The reference design contains HDL blocks for interfacing with the various
components of the motor control hardware:

-  **Current Monitor** - Implements the communication with the AD7401 sigma delta modulators present on the AD-FMCMOTCON2-EBZ and also the SINC3 filters for demodulating the 1-bit digital stream provided by these parts. This HDL block exposes a set of registers that can be accessed through the AXI Lite interface. A FIFO interface connected to a DMA controller allows the block to stream real time data to the application layer. An ADC PACK IP is used so that 1, 2 or all channels can stream data at a time.
-  **Controller** - Implements the interface to the IP control blocks in the system. A FIFO interface connected to a DMA controller allows the block to stream real time data to the application layer. It implements a basic six point drive of the motor. An ADC PACK block is used so that 1, 2, 4 or all channels can stream data at a time.
-  **Speed Detector** - Implements the algorithm for converting Hall, BEMF and Encoder signals into speed and position data. This HDL block exposes a set of registers that can be accessed through the AXI Lite interface. A FIFO interface connected to a DMA controller allows the block to stream real time data to the application layer.
-  **GMII to RGMII** - Converts the GMII interface from the two Ethernet cores from the PS7 block to RGMII interface that is available on the FMC Controller Board. The IP allows for the RX pins to be on different I/O Banks.
-  **I2C** - There are two I2C interfaces connected to the FMC board.
