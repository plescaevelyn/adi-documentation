ADIS16210/PCBZ USER GUIDE
=========================

The ADIS16210/PCBZ is a "breakout board," which provides (1) ADIS16210CMLZ and
(1) interface PCB to simplify the process of "prototyping" during the early
stages of system design and evaluation.

ADIS16210CMLZ
-------------

The ADIS16210CMLZ is a fully-integrated/calibrated, digital tilt sensor, which
provides a serial peripheral interface (SPI) for all digital communications. It
provides a flexible connector interface, with a with 15-lead, cable edge
interface. which minimizes board space, but does not support standard ribbon
cable connections.

INTERFACE PCB
-------------

The interface PCB provides access to the ADIS16210CMLZ, using a dual-row, 16-pin
connector, which supports standard ribbon cable systems and hand-soldering
connection techniques. The interface PCB also provides two sets of mounting
holes: one set of holes for attaching the ADIS16210CMLZ to the interface PCB and
another set of holes for mounting the interface board to the system’s frame. The
first set of holes line up with the ADIS16210CMLZ's mounting holes and are
pre-tapped for use with M2x0.4mm machine screws. The second set of holes are
support M2 machine screws and line up with M2x0.4mm, pre-tapped holes on the
EVAL-ADIS evaluation system board.

INTERFACE CONNECTOR PIN ASSIGNMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

J1 is the electrical connector that provides direct access to power, ground and
critical digital I/O pins on the devices. It is a 16-pin, dual-row, 2-mm pitch
connector that support 1mm ribbon cable systems. Here is the pin assignments for
J1:

NOTE: The ADIS16210CMLZ does not support DIO3 and DIO4, so pins 15 and 16 are
not connected.

Check out the following link for ideas on how to make or purchase 16-pin, 1mm
ribbon cables that can mate to the ADIS16210/PCBZ.

PHYSICAL SETUP
--------------

Installing the ADIS16210CMLZ onto the Interface board requires two steps:

1. Insert the end of the flex cable (ADIS16210CMLZ) into J2 on the interface
   board. Check out the video attachment at this link for a demonstration.

2. Secure the ADIS16210CMLZ base to the Interface PCB, using four M2x0.4mm
   machine screws

3. Connect J1 to the application processor, using a 16-pin ribbon cable.
