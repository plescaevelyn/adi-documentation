ADIS16000/ADIS16229 Evaluation with EVAL-ADIS
=============================================

OVERVIEW
--------

The :adi:`ADIS16000` and :adi:`ADIS16229` enable creation of a simple wireless vibration-sensing network for a wide variety of industrial-equipment applications. . The ADIS16000 provides the gateway function, which manages the network, while the ADIS16229 provides the remote sensing function. The :adi:`ADIS16000` SPI interface provides simple connectivity with most embedded processor platforms and the SMA connector interface enables the use of many different antennas. This module supports up to six :adi:`ADIS16229` devices at one time, using a proprietary wireless protocol. Once it has appropriate power on the VDD pin, the ADIS16000 will automatically begin a self-initialization process. Once this process is complete, the SPI interface activates and provides access to its register structure. The SPI interface supports connectivity with most embedded processor platforms, using the connection diagram below. The factory default configuration for DO1 provides a busy indicator signal that indicates when to avoid SPI communication requests.

   Unsuccessful addition of the sensor node can occur under the following circumstances..
   
   **Case 1:** A new sensor node had not been powered on during the initial start of the application. If this is the case, User can turn on the sensor and follow `connecting nodes <https://wiki.analog.com/adis16000-adis16229-eval-adis>`_ section for adding the new sensor.
   
   **Case 2:** ADIS16000 had been reset and the sensor node is already part of the network with a sensor identifier flashed in it. As a result, the sensor node does not respond to the command for adding a new sensor to Gateway. In order to check this case, follow `Scan Network section <https://wiki.analog.com/adis16000-adis16229-eval-adis>`_ for updating Gateway with already existing nodes.
   
   **Case 3:** ADIS16000 or ADIS16229 is in an unknown state. Power cycle both the parts and restart the application.
   


Manual Trigger Mode
-------------------

A sensor was successfully added to the network. User can start a FFT capture from sensor 1 by clicking on **Start** button. Any user initiated command is issued to the sensor node whose tab is currently active. For example, if Sensor 1 tab is held active by clicking on it and then a start command is issued, FFT capture is obtained from Sensor Node 1.

Reconfiguring the Sensor Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User can read the registers of the sensor by clicking on the menu **Register access** in the main window. A window with registers of Page 0 and Page X (x being the sensor node that is active) is displayed as shown below.

Sensor node can be updated in a 4 step process..

**Step 1:** Hold the respective sensor node active by clicking on its tab in the main wondow and then Click on Register access menu.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229-register-menu.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

**Step 2:** In the register access menu, Scroll down to the registers of the respective sensor page indicated by Page column of the Table as shown below. Click on the register that needs to be modified

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229-registers-defined.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

**Step 3:** Enter the new value in the box and hit Write.

   :align: center
   :width: 600px

**Step 4:** Scroll up to registers in Page 0 and then Select COMMAND_16K. Write the command 0x02 which is a command to update the sensor node. A wait of 400 ms will ensure that the sensor is updated with the new settings.

   :align: center
   :width: 600px

**Sensor Reconfiguration in Periodic mode**

The user can alternately use Register access to set up the periodic mode. When a remote sensor is set up in periodic mode using Register access and data collection is started, the sensor can be stopped only by writing **0x800** to the **COMMAND_S** register in the corresponding sensor page. **Writing 0x02 to COMMAND_16K should not be issued** to stop periodic mode. When the sensor is in periodic mode, it wakes up and updates the Gateway with the new data and also checks if any of its configuration had been changed by the user since its last update.

<blockquote> **If a stop command(0x800) is issued in COMMAND_S of the respective sensor page of Gateway, then the sensor reads the stop command and stops going further into sleep. The part puts itself in manual periodic mode and waits to get more commands for further action.** </blockquote>

<blockquote> **Instead of a stop command(0x800) if other the sensor registers are changed in its page, then the sensor reads those changes in its subsequenct update and reconfigures itself before going back to periodic mode.** </blockquote>

Connecting to ADIS16229 Nodes
-----------------------------

A user can add more sensors to the network by clicking on Network menu to invoke the Network control window followed by a 3 step process. The new sensors that need to be added to the network needs to be powered on one at a time during this process.

Step 1:Turn on one new sensor node that needs to be added to the network. Sensors already in the network can remain powered on.

Step 2:Click on the desired new sensor # in the network control window which is not active (not already assigned).

Step 3: Click on ADD sensor button to add the new sensor.

After a wait time of 5 seconds, the sensor should be successfully added to the network. Now the user could move on to the addition of the next new node if needed.

Alarm Configuration
-------------------

User can configure alarm thresholds for various sample rate options and bands using the Alarm Settings window that is invoked by clicking on Alarms menu

User can load a default setting for Alarms by first clicking on **Read Default Values** button and then clicking on **Write to Dut** button. After a wait time of 400 msecs, User can check if the operation was successful by clicking on **Read from DUT** button. Please note that **Write to DUT** command in the application flashes the settings on the part.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_alarm_settings.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

After this step, User can enable Alarms using the steps detailed in section Reconfiguring the Sensor nodes by

**Step 1 :** Write 0x03 to ALM_CTRL register in the respective sensor page.

**Step 2 :** Write 0x02 to COMMAND_16K in page 0 to update the sensor node that was recently updated in the previous step.

At this point, the Alarms are enabled in the sensor. Alarm status page can be opened to monitor alarms beyond this point.

The user can initiate a capture in Manual FFT mode to check for the Alarms. At the end of the capture, the Alarm status should refresh indicating the status of Alarms in the capture.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229-alarms-status.png
   :align: center
   :width: 700px

When an alarm is triggered, the alarm status window indicates it with a yellow shade or a red shade on the corresponding band and axis in the table. The yellow shade indicates a lower threshold alarm has been activated. The red shade indicates that the higher threshold has been activated in the corresponding band and axis.
