ADIS16229 VIBRATION MONITORING DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM
===================================================

This system provides a simple way to demonstrate the concept of a remote vibration monitoring system, using the :adi:`ADIS16000` and :adi:`ADIS16229`. All of the necessary components fasten to a fluorescent yellow plate and the system requires two USB ports on a PC to support full operation. One of the USB cables manages communication with the Gateway node (:adi:`ADIS16000`) and the other supplies power to the vibration source. The vibration source is a simple, off-balance motor that comes in a black plastic case. The potentiometer provides a gross tuning method for controlling the amount of vibration on the platform.

Managing Error Messages
-----------------------

.. container:: center round box

   **Typical Error Messages and Solutions:**

   
   The application would fail to start in the event of no USB connection to the Evaluation board. When the user sees the following error message, Ensure that ADIS16000 is connected to the Eval Board.
   
   .. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/device_selection.jpg
      :align: center
      :width: 300px
   
   When the user sees the following error message, Ensure that ADIS16000 is selected in **Devices** drop-down menu.
   
   .. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/16228.jpg
      :align: center
      :width: 300px
   
   User is notified of an unsuccessful addition of a sensor node to the network as shown below.
   
   .. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/16629_unsuccessful_addition.jpg
      :align: center
      :width: 300px
   
   Unsuccessful addition of the sensor node can occur under the following circumstances..
   
   **Case 1:** A new sensor node had not been powered on during the initial start of the application. If this is the case, User can turn on the sensor and follow `connecting nodes <https://wiki.analog.com/vibrationdemo>`_ section for adding the new sensor.
   
   **Case 2:** ADIS16000 had been reset and the sensor node is already part of the network with a sensor identifier flashed in it. As a result, the sensor node does not respond to the command for adding a new sensor to Gateway. In order to check this case, follow the instructions for scanning the network in the `Network Control section <https://wiki.analog.com/vibrationdemo>`_ to update the :adi:`ADIS16000` (Gateway) with already existing nodes.
   
   **Case 3:** ADIS16000 or ADIS16229 is in an unknown state. Power cycle both the parts and restart the application.
   


Connecting to ADIS16229 Nodes
-----------------------------

A user can add more sensors to the network by clicking on Network menu to invoke the Network control window followed by a 3 step process. The new sensors that need to be added to the network needs to be powered on one at a time during this process.

Step 1: Turn on one new sensor node that needs to be added to the network. Sensors already in the network can remain powered on.

Step 2: Click on the desired new sensor # in the network control window which is not active (not already assigned).

Step 3: Click on **Add Sensor** button to add the new sensor.

After a wait time of 5 seconds, the sensor should be successfully added to the network. Now the user could move on to the addition of the next new node if needed.

   :width: 700px

Network Control
---------------

When the sensor nodes are already connected to the network and Gateway Node is reset using Software reset or a Power cycle, the sensor nodes can be retrieved by using the following steps.

**Step 1:** Click on the Network menu to invoke the Network control Window **Step 2:** Click on **Scan Network** button.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/scan_network.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

The Gateway node checks for every node in the network ( Node 1 through 6) and updates its sensor map at the end of it.

Demo Modes
----------

Click on the **Demo** option in the Menu bar to reveal two different options: **Network Manual FFT** and **Network Periodic FFT**.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-06.png
   :width: 800px

Network Manual FFT
------------------

The **Network Manual FFT** option causes the :adi:`ADIS16229` to run a continuous loop of data capture, analysis, and communication of the FFT results to the **FFT Display Window** in the Vibration Analysis Software. This is the simplest mode to run a demonstration in but it will only support ~14-16 hours of battery life. The following screen shows the FFT, with a relatively low noise floor.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-07.png
   :width: 800px

Once this mode is in operation, you can hit the **Stop** button to stop it or you can hit the **Esc** key. This function is still being tested and improved. At the present time, using the **Esc** seems to be more robust.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-06a.png
   :width: 800px

After starting this mode, start turning the potentiometer on the motor, until it starts to respond. After it starts vibrating, turn it down as low as possible, without completing stopping the vibration. When the motor is on, it typically generates enough sound to hear.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-08.png
   :width: 800px

While tweaking the motor up, notice the change in the FFT result, on the y-axis in particular.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-09.png
   :width: 800px

To change the scale on the plot, hover the mouse pointer over the results area and **Right Click** to reveal the scale adjustment window.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-10.png
   :width: 800px

Click on the **>** button in this window to increase the range on the scale.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-11.png
   :width: 800px

Click on **Close** to close the scale adjustment box.

If the motor vibration is high enough, the plate could start moving around on its surface. Notice the change in the FFT profile: the magnitude increases, but at the lower frequencies.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-12.png
   :width: 800px

Network Periodic FFT
--------------------

Going back to the **Main Window** and the **Demo** option, the **Network Periodic FFT** mode will cause the :adi:`adis16229` to wake-up every 10 seconds, collect data, analyze the data, transmit the results to the PC (through the :adi:`ADIS16000`, ADIS16COM1/PCBZ and the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS`) and then go back to sleep again. When using this mode, the LED on the :adi:`ADIS16229` will blink when it is on (approximately one time every 10 seconds). Also, note that the **System Development Platform Wait** window will appear during the "Sleep time" for the :adi:`ADIDS16229 <ADIS16229>`.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/229_vibedemo_vep-14.png
