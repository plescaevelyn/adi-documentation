GENERAL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

This user guide describes the evaluation software that interfaces with the
ADXL313 accelerometer. For more information on performance details, see the
ADXL313 datasheet. The EVAL-SDP-CB1Z is the serial system demonstration platform
controller board from Analog Devices, Inc. The SDP-B is part of the Analog
Devices system demonstration platform (SDP). SDP controller boards provide a
means of communicating with the sensor from the PC. The EVAL-SDP-INTERZ is an
SDP interface board. This board serves as an interposer between the SDP
controller board and the evaluation board. The interface board is designed to be
compatible with various Analog Devices inertial sensor evaluation boards. The
EVAL-ADXL313-SDP is an evaluation board that is separate from the interface
board to allow easier manipulation of the device for testing (that is, rotating
the device around its sensitive axis). The evaluation board is connected to the
interface board via a 10-pin cable connector. This user guide provides an
overview of how to use the application software. The functionality of the
software is described with examples provided where appropriate. Figure 1 shows
the required hardware.

SOFTWARE STARTUP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the software first starts, it will ask the user to specify which interface
board is being used. There are three revisions of this board (Rev 1 and Rev 2).
The user can determine which board you are using by looking at the label in the
lower right corner. It will say “SDP Interface Board” (which is Rev 1) or “SDP
Interface Board Rev. 2” (which is Rev 2). The user can also look at the 6 digits
identifier to determine which revision board you have. 301-522 is the Rev 1
board, 301-621 is the Rev 2 board.

GETTING STARTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADXL313 Customer Evaluation System provide an easy start evaluating the
sensor performance. The graphic user interface is divided into separate tabs,
each of which specializes in commonly performed measurements for accelerometer
devices. In this way, the evaluation system offers users an immediate ability to
capture data for a wide variety of tests without the need to develop a
customized hardware and software solution.

A brief description of the functionality contained within the evaluation
environment is presented in Table 1.

   :align: center
   :width: 700

**Table 1:** Evaluation Environment Overview.

On each tab, the **Start Data Acquisition** and **Stop Data Acquisition** buttons are the primary ways the user acquires data from the device. Click **QUIT PROGRAM** located in the lower right of the start-up window to exit the software at any time. Other functionalities shared by all tabs are:

Memory Register Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides the ability to read the memory register or to take a snapshot of the
current memory register values. Click the Read Register Map button for a
snapshot of the current memory register values (see Figure 6). This also updates
the serial number and device ID.

   :width: 250

**Figure 6:** ADXL313 Memory Map and Identification Information.

Software Reset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in the ADXL313 data sheet, a software reset command resets the
ADXL313 and clears all user applied settings. This returns the part to its
default configuration. For example, if the data rate was set to 3200Hz, a
software reset will change the data rate to 100Hz (the default). Click the*\*
RESTORE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION*\* button (see Figure 7) to perform a software
reset of the ADXL313 device. The software reset command can be issued at any
time when the software is not busy performing another action. It is important to
note that a software reset will also return the part to standby mode. To read
acceleration data from the part, it must be placed in measurement mode.

   :align: center
   :width: 400

**Figure 7:** SOFTWARE RESET Control.

Hardware Reset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To perform a hardware reset of the ADXL313, click the **HARDWARE RESET** button (see Figure 8). This turns off power to the device. Power off can be observed by monitoring the power LED to the left of the HARDWARE RESET button. If the LED is off, power to the device is off. After power has been off for 5 sec, power is restored. It is important to note that a hardware reset will also return the part to standby mode. To read acceleration data from the part, it must be placed in measurement mode.

The following sections describe the purpose of each tab of the software.

DEVICE OVERVIEW TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :align: center
   :width: 1000

**Figure 9:** Device Overview Tab.

The Device Overview tab is a good way to become familiar with how the device
operates. This tab contains all of the controls to configure the part. For
example, when the part first turns on, it powers up in standby mode. The ADXL313
powers up in standby mode to minimize power consumption. To exit standby mode,
look at the Power Settings control. Change the mode from standby to measurement
mode (see Figure 10 below).

   :align: center
   :width: 400

**Figure 10:** Standby to Measurement Mode.

It is recommended that the part be placed in Full resolution mode (see Figure
11).

   :align: center
   :width: 400

**Figure 11:** Data Format - Resolution.

The range should also be set to a value that allows a 1g field without clipping
the signal (see Figure 12).

|image1|

**Figure 12:** Data Format - Range.

Once the part is in Measurement mode, click the Start Data Acquisition button to
stream data from the device. The device then continuously streams data until the
Stop Data Acquisition button is clicked. The user can experiment by moving the
device around to observe the response. The ADXL313 contains a 3-axis
accelerometer, meaning the device is sensitive to acceleration in any direction.
See Figure 13 for reference.

**Figure 13:** Axes of Acceleration Sensitivity (Corresponding Output Increases When Accelerated Along the Sensitive Axis).

The ADXL313 has many user configurable settings to customize its operation for
various applications. Configuring the ADXL313 is as simple as selecting the
desired option from the drop-down menu.

Table 2 shows a summary of the device controls and states for each control.
Default settings are shown in bold.

   :width: 600

**Table 2:** Device Output Settings (default settings shown in bold).

Select the configuration option to dynamically update the ADXL313 device. For
example, changing the sleep data rate from 8 Hz to 1 Hz, as shown in Figure 14,
updates the ADXL313 register map immediately. This way, the ADXL313 Memory Map
clearly shows how the bits correspond to the applied configuration. For more
information on the register map, see the ADXL313 data sheet.

**Figure 14:** Changing Sleep Data Rate and its effect on the Registers.

There are five interrupts that can be present in the ADXL313 and each
corresponds to a different event. These are the DATA_READY, Activity,
Inactivity, Watermark, and Overrun interrupts. For a detailed definition of each
of these interrupts, see the ADXL313 datasheet.

Figure 15 shows the interrupt controls for INT_ENABLE and INT_MAP as well as the
indicators for INT_SOURCE. The INT_ENABLE controls have two states, enabled and
disabled. These are all disabled by default. The INT_ENABLE controls determine
whether the interrupts can be generated. The INT_MAP controls determine whether
the interrupt is mapped to the INT1 or INT2 pin (see device pinout in the
ADXL313 datasheet). Each interrupt is mapped to INT1 by default. The INT_SOURCE
indicators will each light up when its corresponding interrupt is present.

   :align: center
   :width: 400

**Figure 15:** Interrupt Settings example. The rounded LEDs show the INT_SORCE register current status. The

For example, in Figure 15 the DATA_READY, Watermark, and Overrun interrupts are
all present since each of their LEDs is on. However, only DATA_READY and
Watermark interrupt are enabled. In this case with DATA_READY mapped to INT1 and
Watermark mapped to INT2. Notice that even though the Overrun interrupt is
present (since its LED indicator is on), it is not mapped to any pin because its
INT_ENABLE control is disabled.

The interrupt controls can be configured many different ways for various
applications including the Auto-Sleep mode. There are two ways to place the
ADXL313 into Auto-Sleep mode in the Overview Tab. The first is to enable the
Auto-Sleep and Link dropdown menus. The Activity and Inactivity interrupts must
also be enabled by clicking on them. The second way is to click on the
Auto-Sleep Disabled button. The button will highlight and change to Auto-Sleep
Enabled. Either method accomplishes the same thing: the part is now in
auto-sleep mode. Figure 16 shows how the controls should look when Auto-Sleep is
enabled. Note that the Activity and Inactivity thresholds still need to be set
in order for Auto-Sleep mode to function correctly. The Figure 16 shows an
example of the device fully configured on Auto-Sleep mode.

   :align: center
   :width: 800

**Figure 17:** Data Record Tab.

The Data Record tab allows the user to measure and record acceleration data. The
data is acquired at a user specified data rate and is shown on the plot (see
Figure 17). The data is then saved to a text file with the date, time, and
device ID recorded as a header. To specify the file path, click the small folder
icon under Directory to Save File and browse to the desired folder. If an
existing file is selected, data is appended to the end of the file. The user can
choose a data rate from 6.25 Hz to 3200 Hz with the Data Rate Select control
(see Figure 18).

   :align: center
   :width: 400

**Figure 18:** Data Rate Select Control.

Figure 19 shows the Match Data Rate control. This tab will acquire data at the
rate specified in the Data Rate Select control (100 Hz in this case). When the
Match Data Rate control is checked, this tab will match the data rate when the
part is in in auto-sleep mode. In other words, when the part is in normal mode,
the program will acquire data at 100 Hz. However, when the part is in sleep
mode, the program will only acquire data at an 8 Hz data rate to reflect that
the part is generating data at a much lower data rate.

   :align: center
   :width: 400

**Figure 19:** Match Data Rate Control.

Each time the Start Data Acquisition button is clicked, the program starts
recording the data to a text file. To select the Directory to Save File, click
the folder icon and navigate to the desired folder (see Figure 20). If no
directory is specified, the program uses the directory of the current
applications as a default. The file name can be specified in the control (see
Figure 20). If a file with that name already exists, the data is appended to the
end of that file.

FIFO ANALYSIS TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :align: center
   :width: 800

**Figure 21:** FIFO Analysis Tab.

The FIFO Analysis tab demonstrates the various FIFO modes available to the
ADXL313. FIFO (or First In, First Out) is a method for utilizing a data buffer
to prevent loss of data. The user can understand how the different FIFO modes
operate by experimenting with the FIFO Demo function. To do this:

-  Ensure that the Enable FIFO Demo control is checked. Set the Data Sampling
   Rate control toward the Slower sampling side of the scroll bar. Make sure it
   looks similar to Figure 22 below.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/accelerometers/adxl313/eval-adxl313-sdp_gui_fifo_dsr1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300

**Figure 22:** FIFO Demo Controls.

-  Ensure that the part is in FIFO mode or Stream mode (not Bypass mode) using
   the FIFO settings control (Figure 23).

   :align: center
   :width: 300

**Figure 23:** FIFO Mode Control.

-  Set the FIFO Samples to 16 in FIFO Settings (see Figure 24). The FIFO samples
   indicator and the FIFO control register will automatically update to this
   value.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/accelerometers/adxl313/eval-adxl313-sdp_gui_fifo_samplecontrol.png
   :align: center
   :width: 750

**Figure 24:** FIFO Samples Control – Updates FIFO Samples Indicator (left) and Memory Register, 0x38 FIFO_CTL (right).

The FIFO Entries indicator is a direct reading of the FIFO entries bits
(Register FIFO_STATUS, Address 0x39, bits [5:0). This indicator reports how many
data values are stored in the FIFO. The FIFO stores a maximum of 32 entries,
which equates to a maximum of 33 entries available at a given time because an
additional entry is available at the output filter of the device. Click Start
Data Acquisition. The FIFO Entries indicator will be full, since the part is
generating data much faster than the program is requesting data from the part.
It should look similar to Figure 24.

When the FIFO is full, the watermark and overrun interrupts will be set and
their respective LED indicators will be on. The watermark bit is set when the
number of samples in the FIFO equals the value stored in the samples bits
(Register FIFO_CTL, Address 0x38, bits [4:0]) The overrun bit is set when new
data replaces unread data. The overrun bit is automatically cleared when the
contents of the FIFO are read.

Next, increase the Data Sampling Rate by moving the scroll bar further toward
the Faster sampling side as shown in Figure 25.

|image2|

**Figure 25:** FIFO Demo - Controlling Data Sampling Rate.

The user will see the FIFO Entries value slowly start to decrease. The software
is now requesting data slightly faster than the ADXL314 is generating new data.
The program is now requesting data faster than the part is generating data.
Watch as the FIFO Entries value approaches the FIFO Samples value. As long as
the FIFO Entries value is greater than or equal to the FIFO Samples value, the
watermark bit will be set. As soon as the FIFO Entries drops below the FIFO
samples value, the watermark bit will be cleared (see Figure 26).

   :align: center
   :width: 500

**Figure 26:** FIFO Demo - Watermark Interrupt.

Now to actually record data from the part using FIFO, disable (uncheck) the
Enable FIFO Demo control. This will disable the FIFO demo and will enable FIFO
data recording. The software will now request data 5% faster than the set data
rate. If the data rate is set to 100 Hz, data will be sampled from the part at a
105 Hz rate. This will ensure that no data is lost. Data can be recorded in FIFO
or Stream mode. FIFO Trigger mode operates differently from the other FIFO
modes. This mode collects data centered around an event. This event is triggered
by a user defined interrupt.

Complete the following steps to configure the ADXL313 to operate in FIFO Trigger
mode as shown in Figure 27:

-  Set the Activity Threshold to 0.3g. Note that it will auto-correct to 0.296875g since this value increments in 15.625mg steps.
-  Set the Activity/Inactivity Threshold Coupling to AC coupling.
-  Enable the x-axis Activity/Inactivity Interrupts.
-  Enable the Activity Interrupt from the INT_ENABLE register.
-  Set the interrupt to INT2 (INT_MAP register). When the trigger event occurs, it will send the interrupt to the INT2 pin.
-  Set FIFO mode to Trigger.
-  Set the Trigger source to INT2. When the event occurs, the ADXL313 will look for the trigger in the INT2 pin.
-  Set the Samples control to 5. This will save 5 data points before the event
   occurs.

Now that the ADXL313 is configured, click Start Data Acquisition. Data will be
continuously streamed from the ADXL314 until the activity interrupt is
triggered. Immediately following this, the ADXL314 will keep the last 5 samples
(set in the Samples control) and will then enter FIFO mode. It will then collect
another 27 data points immediately following the trigger event. In this way, the
ADXL313 will record 5 data points before the event and 27 data points after the
event (for a total of 32 data points).

|image3|

**Figure 27:** FIFO Trigger Mode Example.

Figure 28 shows example data while operating in FIFO Trigger mode. The software
streams data from the part until an event is triggered. As soon as the x-axis
output increases by more than 3.9g, an activity interrupt is generated and
mapped to the INT2 pin. The FIFO settings are set to look at INT2 for the
trigger event. As soon as the event occurs the FIFO saves the 5 most recent data
points. It then collects another 27 data points to show the output of the part
following the trigger event. Data is saved automatically while the test is
running. The program creates a header with the date, time stamp, and device ID.
The program then records x-, y-, and z-axis acceleration data, INT_SOURCE, FIFO
Entries, and FIFO Trigger bit value. Specify the File Path and the file name in
the controls at the bottom of the tab. If no directory is entered, the program
defaults to the current application directory.

AUTO-SLEEP TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :align: center
   :width: 800

**Figure 29:** Auto-Sleep Tab.

The Auto-Sleep tab demonstrates how the auto-sleep mode operates. This feature
is very useful for low power consumption applications. The ADXL313 can enter a
low power state when it is idle. It can be programmed to wake up when activity
is detected (i.e. when the acceleration data changes). The user can configure
the part a variety of ways to determine exactly when the part enters sleep mode
and when it wakes up. There is a Status indicator in the bottom right corner of
this panel (see Figure 29). This indicator will show whether the ADXL313 is
operating in Normal Mode (LED is off) or Sleep Mode (LED is on).

In order for the ADXL313 to know when to enter sleep mode and when to wake up, activity and inactivity thresholds must be set. These can be set in the **Activity Thresholds** Control in the bottom left corner of the panel (see Figure 29).

The Activity Threshold determines how much acceleration the part must experience
before waking up. If the part is operating in sleep mode, one of the axes must
experience 0.3g’s of acceleration to wake up and enter normal operating mode.
The Inactivity Threshold determines when the ADXL313 enters sleep mode. When the
part experiences less than 0.3g’s of acceleration for 3 seconds (the Inactivity
Time), the part enters sleep mode. The data output rate and current consumption
decrease significantly. Once the activity/inactivity thresholds are set, the
interrupts must still be enabled for each axis. For example, assume that only
the x- and y-axes are important for the application. Click the X-Enabled and the
Y-Enabled controls to enable these interrupts as shown in Figure 29. To operate
correctly, both the Activity Interrupt and Inactivity Interrupt controls must be
enabled. In this configuration, only acceleration data in the x- and y-axes is
relevant for determining whether the part is in normal or sleep mode. The z-axis
is completely irrelevant since its activity and inactivity interrupts are
disabled.

Note that the plot can get a little cluttered when too many axes are plotted. If
desired, the user can change the plot visibility by right clicking on a plot in
the legend. Click on the Plot Visible option to enable or disable that axis (see
Figure 30).

   :width: 400

**Figure 30:** Control Plot Visibility.

Figure 31 shows the part with Auto-Sleep enabled. In this example, the x-axis
and y-axis activity/inactivity interrupts are enabled. This means that only the
x- and y-axis outputs will determine whether the part is in normal mode or sleep
mode. The z-axis is irrelevant in determining the sleep state in this
configuration. For this reason, the z-axis is not plotted to improve visibility
of the plot (right click on the legend>Plot visible). In this example the part
is already in sleep mode. This can be seen by looking at the Status indicator
which will say “Sleep mode” or “Normal Mode”. In addition the background of the
plot will darken to indicate that the part is in sleep mode. The Activity and
Inactivity thresholds are set to 0.3 g.

   :align: center
   :width: 750

**Figure 31:** Auto-Sleep Enabled for Two Axes - Sleep Mode Example.

DC threshold coupling is used so the detection levels are at ±0.3g. This means
that if either the x-axis or y-axis acceleration exceeds 0.3g magnitude, the
part will wake up and exit sleep mode. This is shown in Figure 32 below. The
y-axis acceleration exceeds 0.3 g’s and the activity interrupt is generated,
waking the part up. Note that the Status indicator now shows “Normal Mode” and
the plot background is white. In order to enter sleep mode again, both the x-
and y-axis outputs must have magnitudes less than 0.3g.

Note that the black horizontal lines indicate DC thresholds. Blue, red, or green
horizontal lines indicate AC thresholds. Figure 33 shows the part with
Auto-Sleep enabled. In this example, only the x-axis activity/inactivity
interrupts is enabled. This means that only the x-axis output will determine
whether the part is in normal mode or sleep mode.

**Figure 33:** Auto-Sleep Enabled for Single Axis - Sleep Mode Example.

The y- and z-axis outputs are irrelevant in determining the sleep state in this
configuration. For this reason, the y- and z-axis are not plotted to improve
visibility of the plot (right click on the legend>Plot visible). In this example
the part is already in sleep mode. This can be seen by looking at the Status
indicator which will say “Sleep mode” or “Normal Mode”. In addition the
background of the plot will darken to indicate that the part is in sleep mode.
The Activity and Inactivity thresholds are set to 0.3 g. AC threshold coupling
is used so the detection levels are at ±0.3g. Unlike DC coupling, these
thresholds are not centered around 0g. Instead they are centered around the
output acceleration when the auto-sleep mode was activated. In this example the
thresholds are set at 0.2g and 0.8g. Therefore when the auto-sleep was
activated, the x-axis output was 0.56g. As long as the x-axis remains within
±0.3g’s of 0.5g, the part will remain in sleep mode. As soon as the x-axis
exceeds either of the thresholds, the part will wake up and enter normal mode.
It is easy to see the value of operating in AC coupling mode.

Consider a car that has parked on a hill at an angle greater than 17.5o. The
part can still remain in sleep mode even though it is parked on a slope (and
therefore, has a output greater than 0.3g since sin(17.5o) = 0.3g). By using AC
coupling, the part can still wake up and set off a car alarm if it is tampered
with. This can include shock and vibrations or tilting of the vehicle. Figure 34
shows the part waking up when the x-axis output drops below the 0.26g threshold.
Note that as soon as this happens, the part wakes up and the AC thresholds are
reset around this new value. The part will then return to sleep mode when the
x-axis output remains inside this new threshold level for the inactivity time (3
seconds in this example).

**Figure 34:** Auto-Sleep Enabled for Single Axis - Wake up Example.

The new AC thresholds are -0.15g and 0.45g. This corresponds to ±0.3g centered
around 0.15g (the value at the instant the ADXL313 wakes up). The thresholds
will update any time the acceleration exceeds the AC thresholds. Note that the
activity and inactivity thresholds need not be set to the same value. This was
done here for simplicity. However, the inactivity threshold should always be
less than or equal to the activity threshold for the auto-sleep to function
properly.

TILT MEASUREMENT TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :align: center

**Figure 35:** Tilt Measurement Tab.

The ADXL313 is a 3-axis accelerometer, and as such can provide inclination
sensing. Data is acquired at the user specified data rate. The x-, y-, and
z-axis acceleration data is plotted in real time on the main chart. The software
acquires data for 250ms, averages the results, and plots the average value on
the main chart. In other words, each data point is an average of 250ms of data
from the part. In addition, the two images in the lower right corner show the
front view and the side view of an example vehicle. This give a more visual
representation of the inclination data. If more accurate results are desired,
the software allows calibration of the ADXL313. Click the Calibrate XL button to
begin. Following this, a series of 6 pop-up dialog boxes will appear. Follow the
instructions in these dialog boxes. They will instruct you to hold the
evaluation board in specific orientations such that each axis is exposed to a
±1g field. An offset and sensitivity calibration coefficient is then created for
each axis. The following example provides clarity on the process.

-  Place the x-axis in a +1g field. Hold the evaluation board vertically on a flat surface as shown on the left side of Figure 36.
-  Click OK and hold the part still for 1 second.
-  Reorient the part as shown in the next dialog box.
-  Repeat until all 6 measurements have been completed.

   :width: 300

**Figure 36:** Calibration Orientation. X-axis 1g field (left), Z-axis 1g field (right).

Using the y-axis as an example, the measured outputs when the y-axis was placed
in a ±1g field were as follows:

:math:`XL_{out+1g}=0.97956g`

:math:`XL_{out-1g}=-1.034g`

Therefore, the offset can be calculated according to the following formula:

:math:`\displaystyle Offset=XL_{out+1g}+XL_{out-1g}/2 = 0.97956+\frac{-1.034}{2} = -27.22 mg`

And the sensitivity can be calculated according to the following formula:

:math:`\displaystyle Sensitivity= XL_{out+1g}-XL_{out-1g}/2 = 0.97956-\frac{-1.034}{2} = 1.007 g/g`

This demonstrates how the values in Figure 37 were calculated.

SELF-TEST TAB

   :width: 800

**Figure 38:** Self-Test Tab.

The ADXL313 incorporates a self test feature that effectively tests its
mechanical and electronic systems simultaneously. When the self test function is
enabled, an electrostatic force is exerted on the mechanical sensor. This
electrostatic force moves the mechanical sensing element in the same manner as
acceleration, and it is additive to the acceleration experienced by the device.
This added electrostatic force results in an output change in the x-, y-, and
z-axes. This Self Test tab demonstrates how this function operates for each
axis. Once the Start Data Acquisition button is clicked, the software acquires
one second of data from the ADXL313 at the user specified data rate.

-  For the first 250ms, the self test feature is disabled (default state).
-  At 250ms the self test bit is asserted, and the self test function begins. An electrostatic force is applied to the beam. This causes the output to shift as shown in Figure 38.
-  The self test bit is asserted for 500ms.
-  At 750ms the self test bit is de-asserted and the device output return to
   normal.

Acceptable values for self test output are shown in Table 3.

POWER CYCLE TAB

   :align: center
   :width: 800

**Figure 39:** Power Cycle Tab.

Use the Power Cycle tab to determine the turn-on to turn-on variability of the
ADXL313. The device undergoes a hardware reset followed by a series of internal
diagnostic routines to ensure the integrity of its various signal chains.
Following these procedures, acquisition of acceleration information from the
MEMS sensors begins. This will continue until the software has completed the
number of cycles specified by the user. Or if the Run Continuously box was
checked, the software will run until the Stop Data Acquisition button is
clicked.

Using the Power Cycle Controls, specify the off time, the on time, and the
number of power cycles. The off time sets the length of time that power to the
device is turned off. Following this, power is restored and data is acquired for
the specified length of time. The average value is then plotted on the graph.
The output from each inertial channel is plotted after each power cycle.

Figure 39 shows example settings for these controls. In this example, each cycle
begins by turning power off for 250ms then turning power on and acquiring data
for 500ms. This 500ms of data is then averaged together and plotted on the main
chart as a single point.

If the Run Continuously box is unchecked, the software will cycle the power 50
times and then stop. If the Run Continuously box is checked, the Set Number of
Power Cycles control will be disabled and greyed out. The software will then
continue cycling the power and acquiring data until the Stop Data Acquisition
button is clicked.

After each cycle, the current data is updated in the Current Data table to the
left of the Power Cycle Controls (see Figure 39). This table includes
information from the most recent cycle for each inertial channel.

TURN-ON ANALYSIS TAB

**Figure 40:** Turn-On Analysis Tab.

In addition to the bias stability from one power cycle to the next, it is
important to understand the device behavior at the moment power is applied to
the device. The Turn-on Analysis tab demonstrates the transient response when
the device first powers up. The user can select two types of resets, hardware
and software. A hardware reset turns power to the device off for 5 sec. Power is
then restored and data is acquired at the user specified data rate. A software
reset issues the appropriate command to reset the device without removing power.

Following this, acquisition of acceleration information from the MEMS sensor
begins. Figure 40 shows an example of the turn-on characteristics of the ADXL313
after a software reset. The Select Turn-on Method control selects whether a
hardware or software reset is performed. In each case 500ms of data is acquired
to demonstrate the turn-on behavior of the ADXL313.

MOSI COMMAND GENERATOR TAB

**Figure 41:** MOSI Command Generator Tab.

The MOSI Command Generator tab is a useful tool for quickly generating any read
or write command for the ADXL313 with the correct CRC. Click a choice from the
Select Memory Register drop down menu to select the desired register to read or
write to (see Figure 42).

**Figure 43:** Command Type Control.

Figure 44 shows an example of a MOSI write command to write a value of 0x1F to
the x-axis offset register (OFSX, Register 0x1E). For this device, the value of
0x1F written to OFSX register, adds a +0.1209g offset to the x-axis. Thus, in a
0g field the x-axis will still output 0.1209g. Click the Calculate MOSI Command
button to update the Full MOSI Command output shown on the right side of Figure
44 (0x00001E1F).

Press Start Acquisition data button if you wish to visualize the MOSI command
created on the ADXL313 Register Map. The OFSX register will now display the
offset added to the x-axis output as shown in the Figure 45.

**Figure 45:** Write Value of 0x1F to OFSX Register.

Figure 46 explains what each field of the MOSI command represents for a write
command. A ‘0’ in the most significant digit (shown in green) indicates that
this is a MOSI write command. The address field (shown in orange) is 6 bits long
and indicates to which address the write command is addressed. The last 8 bits
(shown in blue) contain the write data to be written to the register specified
in the address field. The example in Figure 46 shows a write command to register
0x27 (ACT_INACT_CTL).

**Figure 46:** Explanation of MOSI Write Command Fields.

Figure 47 explains what each field of the MOSI command represents for a read
command. A ‘1’ in the most significant digit indicates that this is a MOSI read
command. The next digit is the multi-byte read. If this digit is ‘0’, the
command will read a single register specified by the address field. In the
example in Figure 47, a multi-byte read starting with address 0x32 (DATA_X0). If
5 more bytes of 0’s are sent after this, the MISO response will contain read
data of all the inertial data channels (DATA_X0 to DATA_Z1). In this way,
acceleration data from x-, y-, and z-axis channels can be read with a single
command.
