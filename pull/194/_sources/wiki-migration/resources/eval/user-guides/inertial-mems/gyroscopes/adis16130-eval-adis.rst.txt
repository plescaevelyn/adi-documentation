f===== ADIS16130 EVALUATION ON THE EVAL-ADIS =====

INTRODUCTION
============

The purpose of this Wiki Guide is to describe an approach to use for evaluating the :adi:`ADIS16130` on the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS` evaluation system. Although the :adi:`ADIS16130` package and electrical connector would support physical connection with the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS`, its pin assignment, SPI protocol, data format and operation prevent compatibility with the IMU Evaluation software package.

Since the :adi:`ADIS16130` is on a "Last time buy," new design projects should consider the :adi:`ADIS16133`, :adi:`ADIS16135` or :adi:`ADIS16136`, as they provide better performance/price trade-offs, in the same package as the :adi:`ADIS16130`. In addition, the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS` and IMU Evaluation Software package provide direct support for the :adi:`ADIS16135`, which will be more convenient than the process for evaluating the :adi:`ADIS16130` on the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS` evaluation system.

OVERVIEW
========

Connecting the :adi:`ADIS16130BMLZ <ADIS16130>` to the :adi:`EVAL-ADISZ <EVAL-ADIS>` evaluation system will require the use of J1, on the :adi:`EVAL-ADISZ <EVAL-ADIS>`, an interface board and a cable. The following pictures provide an example of what this type of system might look like. The remainder of this Wiki Guide will describe this system and provide tips for those who may want to develop their own interface system for evaluating the :adi:`ADIS16130BMLZ <ADIS16130>` ON the :adi:`EVAL-ADISZ <EVAL-ADIS>`.

\`1q====SOFTWARE TUTORIALS (EXAMPLES)====

EXAMPLE #1: Total Noise Measurement
-----------------------------------

The :adi:`ADIS16130` datasheet does not have a parameter for total noise, but it does offer typica specifications for both noise and bandwidth. The total noise is equal to the noise density, times the square root of the noise bandwidth. Since the ADIS16130 has a two pole filter (327, 1000Hz), we can approximate the noise bandwidth to be ~1.4 x the cut-off frequency (300Hz, :adi:`per Table 1 in the ADIS16130 datasheet) <static/imported-files/data_sheets/ADIS16130.pdf>`.

Therefore:

Total Noise = 0.0125 x sqrt(1.4 x 300) = ~0.255 deg/sec

Start this process by verifying basic function, using the waveform recorder mode. After verifying that the :adi:`ADIS16130` is functional, place it in a secure location, where it will not be moved during data collection. Then, update the main menu settings in the picture below (total samples, etc).

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/gyroscopes/adis16130-es-mm-noise-01.png
   :width: 800px

After verifying all of these settings, click on **Start Streaming**. When the following window opens, select the file name and location, then click on **Save** to start the datalog.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/gyroscopes/adis16130-es-mm-noise-02.png
   :width: 600px

The data streaming progress shows up as a "Stream xx% complete," with 100% complete indicating that all of the data samples are in the target file.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/gyroscopes/adis16130-es-mm-noise-03.png
   :width: 800px

Click on the following file to see the result of this test on a lab unit. In this test, the :adi:`adis16130` noise result was close to 0.2 deg/sec.

`adis16130-noisetest-01.xlsx <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/gyroscopes/adis16130-noisetest-01.xlsx>`_



EXAMPLE #2: Sensitivity
-----------------------

This example exercise is based on the calibration method that the following article reference explains:

:adi:`A Simple Gyroscope Calibration by Mark Looney, EDN Europe, July 2010 <static/imported-files/tech_articles/GyroCalibration_EDN_EU_7_2010.pdf>`

Start this process by entering 114000 samples for the record size, which provides a data record of 20 seconds at the nominal sample rate of 5700SPS.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/gyroscopes/adis16130-es-mm-sens-02.png
   :width: 800px

Click on **Start Streaming**, enter the file name/location in the window that pops up and then click on **Save** to start the streaming process. Then, gently rotate the :adi:`ADIS16130`/Interface PCB around, 180 degrees, using the PCB edge and the edge of a table as a guide. Allow the device to rest (zero motion) for a couple of seconds and then rotate it back. This entire process must be complete before the data streaming completes.

NOTE: Over-ranging the gyroscope will introduce errors. This might require iteration to achieve expected results.

Here is an example of a hand-turn, which was a bit choppy but still produced results that were within the expected error range for sensitivity on the :adi:`adis16130`. The 3% error is well within the datasheet specification of +/-10% for sensitivity error.

EXAMPLE #3: Bias vs Temperature
-------------------------------

The :adi:`adis16130` datasheet offers performance curves that project a "bias temperature coefficient" of approximately 0.04 deg/sec per degree Celsius. The purpose of this experiment is to illustrate the process of testing this on an actual :adi:`ADIS16130` unit, using the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS` and techniques covered in this Wiki Guide. For this experiment, place the :adi:`ADIS16130`/Interface PCB inside of an oven and use the twisted pair cable to route it to the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS`, which is located outside of the temperature chamber. See the picture below:

|image15| |image16|

Take note of the clamps that are on the interface board, but not on the :adi:`\|ADIS16130 <adis16130>`. In some cases, clamping the :adi:`adis16130` down to the board will be necessary, due to the vibration in the oven. This was not important for this exercise, but can be influential when developing fixtures for calibration systems.

The following table illustrates the thermal profile for the temperature chamber for this experiment. For those who are developing calibration systems, the dwell times and ramp rates are likely to be an area for application-specific optimization.

============ =============================== =======================
Temperature  Dwell Time/Ramp Rate            Time
============ =============================== =======================
+25C         5 min                           5 min
+25C to -40C ~2 degC/min                     32.5 min (37.5 min max)
-40C         30min                           30 min
-40C to +85C ~2 degC/min                     62.5 min (67.5 min max)
+85C         15 min                          15 min
+85C to +25C ~2 degC/min                     30 (35 min max)
Total Time = 180 min (typical) 195 min (max) 
============ =============================== =======================

In order to support the maximum profile time of 195 minutes, set the data capture process up to collect data for 210 minutes. This allows for 15 extra minutes, for any expected delays or handling. Of course, this is adjustable, once someone has enough experience to understand how these adjustments impact the overall characterization goals. For now, calculate the total samples by multiplying the record time and the sample rate together.

Total samples = 5700 SPS x 210 min x 60 sec/min = 71820000 samples

In order to keep the file size under control, set the averages to produce a sample rate of 5 SPS in the data record.

Averages = Sample rate/Record data rate = 5700 SPS/5 SPS = 1140

   :width: 600px

Note that the bias temperature coefficient was calculated on the rising edge of the thermal profile, using two points between -40 and +85C. The bias temperature coefficient was was within the expectations that the :adi:`ADIS16130` datasheet sets in its performance curves.

==================== ======================= ===========================

INTERFACE CABLE
---------------

Although the :adi:`EVAL-ADISZ <EVAL-ADIS>` system was not designed to support remote device communication, using J1, experimentation has determined that this port can support up to 12 inches of ribbon cabling, while maintaining quality data communication. For lengths that are greater than 12 inches, use shielded, twisted pair cabling. The cable shown in the OVERVIEW section is 3 feet long.

\*\* Cable part number & supplier \*\*

INTERFACE BOARD
---------------

The interface boards in this Wiki Guide is an old design for an adapter board. While any new project would benefit from a new printed circuit board design, we wanted to illustrate the concept using an existing board. Note that J1 on this interface board only supports pins 1 through 12, so pin 13 was routed to the data-ready connection on the :adi:`ADIS16130BMLZ <ADIS16130>`, using a small piece of wire.

ADIS16130 Pin Assignments
-------------------------

While the :adi:`ADIS16130BMLZ <ADIS16130>` uses the same package style and size as the :adi:`ADIS16136AMLZ <ADIS16136>`, it does not use the same pin assignments. This difference in pin assignments prevents it from plugging directly into J4 on the :adi:`EVAL-ADISZ <EVAL-ADIS>` evaluation system. The following table illustrates these differences.
