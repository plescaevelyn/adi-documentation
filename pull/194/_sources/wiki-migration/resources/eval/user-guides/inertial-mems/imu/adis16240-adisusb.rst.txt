EQUIPMENT LIST
--------------

:adi:`ADISUSB`

:adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>`

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Windows XP, Vista, 7 (32-bit systems only)

NOTE: All the required files are contained in the .Cab file and deployed during software package install.

PHYSICAL SETUP
--------------

The :adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>` provides the :adi:`ADIS16240 <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/product.html>` function on a 1.2 inch × 1.3 inch printed circuit board (PCB), which simplifies the connection to an existing processor system. The four mounting holes accommodate either M2 (2mm) or Type 2-56 machine screws. These boards are made of IS410 material and are 0.063 inches thick. The second level assembly uses a SAC305-compatible solder composition (Pb-free), which has a pre-solder reflow thickness of approximately 0.005 inches. The pad pattern on the :adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>` matches that shown in below. J1 and J2 are dual-row, 2 mm (pitch) connectors that work with a number of ribbon cable systems, including 3M Part Number 152212-0100-GB (ribbon-crimp connector) and 3M Part Number 3625/12 (ribbon cable).

Step #1
~~~~~~~

The connection to the :adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>` is simple using J1 and a 12 pin cable included with the :adi:`ADISUSB`.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/240-pcbz.png
   :width: 500px

**WARNING:** Make sure that the connector cable going from J1 on the :adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>` is properly aligned to the J1 connector on the :adi:`ADISUSB`. The 12 pin cable is included with the :adi:`ADISUSB`.

Step #2
~~~~~~~

Mounting to the system frame is accomplished using 4 M2x.4x4mm machine screws included with the :adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>`. The mounting location holes are marked as an example in the picture below. Use the 4 holes to secure the :adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>` to the :adi:`ADISUSB`.

|image4| |image5|

Step #3
~~~~~~~

The following picture shows JP1 in the **+3.3V** position (factory-default). That is the correct JP1 jumper setting on the :adi:`ADISUSB`) required for the :adi:`ADIS16240/PCBZ <en/mems-sensors/mems-accelerometers/adis16240/products/EVAL-ADIS16240/eb.html>`.

USB Driver Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADIS16240_EVAL_Rev_1.cab file contains USB drivers that are compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems. The drivers are unpacked the same time the software application is loaded by double clicking the setup.exe file. The first time the :adi:`ADISUSB` board is plugged into the computer (using the included USB mini cable) the hardware is recognized and loaded. The computer **Hardware Wizard** will find and install the drivers by following the steps below.

|image8| |image9|

The following pictures show the final steps for USB driver install. Click on **Next** then click on **Finish** completing the installation.

|image10| |image11|

**WARNING:** For those who are using Windows XP, Service Pack 3, additional steps are required for completing the driver installation. Please see page 8, on the :adi:`ADISUSB User Guide (UG-363) <static/imported-files/user_guides/UG-363.pdf#Page=08>` for additional information on these steps.

Main Window
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the :adi:`ADIS16240` Software starts-up, the Main Window will appear and look like the following picture. The second picture provides color-coded boxes to support further discussion of each function in this screen.

|image12| |image13|

The orange box identifies the drop-down menus, which provide a number of useful features.

The **Registers** option provides a listing of user-configurable registers in the :adi:`ADIS16240` and also provides read/write access to each one of these registers.

The **Datalog** option provides the core data collection function.

The purple box identifies the output registers, which update, real-time, after pressing the **Read** button (see the red box for the location of the **Read** button).

The yellow box identifies the waveform recorder window. The window contains the accelerometer outputs.

Register Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the **Register Access** window is to provide both read and write access to the user registers in the :adi:`ADIS16240`. The following picture shows the appearance of this window.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/240-register.png
   :width: 600px

The color coded boxes illustrate the different functions that this window provides.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/inertial-mems/imu/240-register-defined.png
   :width: 600px

The purple box identifies the register category. In addition to the Control/Status, this drop-down control offers access to **Output** and **Calibration** registers.

The red box identifies all of the registers that are in the current category. Click on the register name to select a register for individual read/write access.

The green box identifies the read/write control options for the current register selection. Use the hexadecimal format when writing commands to a particular register.

The yellow box updates all the registers in the current category.

The **Update Flash** command saves writable user register data.

APPLICATION TIP: The **Register Access** screen writes to user control registers, inside of the :adi:`ADIS16240`, two bytes at a time. So, when configuring a register, make sure to include the hexadecimal number for all 16-bits, before pressing the **Write Register** button. When using an embedded processor to write to user control registers, inside of the :adi:`ADIS16240`, each command (16-bits) writes to one byte at a time.

Data Capture Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Data Capture function supports synchronous data acquisition, based on the data-ready signal from the :adi:`ADIS16240`. The following picture represents the Data Capture window, right after opening it from the **Main Window** and the second picture provides color-coded boxes, in order to support further discussion of each function that is associated with this screen.

|image14| |image15|

The red box identifies all of the registers that are eligible for inclusion in the next acquisition process. Click on each box to include a register in the next data acquisition sequence. The box will have a check mark when it has been selected.

The green box identifies the configuration box for the name and location of the data storage file.

The yellow boxes identify a number of configuration options for the data acquisition process. The Samples per File is a user input for the total number of samples in a data record. Note that all selected registers will have this number of samples in the data record file, after the acquisition process completes. After each update to the Record Length box, the software calculates then displays the total Capture Time. The Numeric Data Only…No File Header option allows the user to add or remove the header in the data storage file. The Record as LSB's...No Scaling causes the software to convert the decimal, twos complement number into its representative value. For example, when enabling No Scale LSB's Only, the gyroscope output will be in units of degrees/second.
