Block Diagram
-------------

The data path and clock domains are depicted on the below diagram:

The design has one JESD receive chain having 16 lanes at rate of 12.5Gbps. The
JESD receive chain consists of a physical layer represented by an XCVR module, a
link layer represented by an RX JESD LINK module. The transport layer is common
and is represented by a RX JESD TPL module. The link operates in Subclass 1 by
using the SYSREF signal to edge align the internal local multiframe clock and to
release the received data in the same moment from all lanes, therefore ensuring
that data from all channels is synchronized at the application layer.

The link is set for full bandwidth mode and operates with the following
parameters:

-  Deframer paramaters: L=16, M=1, F=2, S=16, N’=16, N=16
-  GLBLCLK – 312.5MHz (Lane Rate/40)
-  REFCLK – 625 MHz (Lane Rate/20)
-  SYSREF – 19.53MHz (DEVCLK/512)
-  DEVCLK – 10000MHz
-  JESD204B Lane Rate – 12.5Gbps
