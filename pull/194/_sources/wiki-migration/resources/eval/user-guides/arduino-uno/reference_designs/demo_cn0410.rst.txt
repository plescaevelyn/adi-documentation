EVAL-CN0410-ARDZ Shield Demo
============================

:adi:`CN0410` is an Arduino compatible shield that is optimized for smart agriculture to control current passing through LED's. The :adi:`CN0410` is used along the the CFTL-LED Bar that has LED's with specific wavelengths that plants utilize.

The circuit shown below is a complete 3-channel single-supply, 16-bit unbuffered
voltage output DAC that maintains ±2 LSB integral and differential nonlinearity
by utilizing a CMOS DAC. This circuit has a voltage to current conversion that
controls the amount of current passing through an LED by using a MOSFET in its
configuration. The circuit also has an isoSPI repeater that allows multiple
boards to be controlled with a single master.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  Arduino Uno board
   -  EVAL-CN0410-ARDZ
   -  USB type A to USB type B cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port
   -  9V 200ma voltage source with a barrel output connector
   -  :adi:`CFTL-LED-BAR <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/cftl-led-bar.html>`

-  Software

   -  CN0410_example software
   -  Arduino/Genuino IDE
   -  Arduino AVR Boards Built-In by Arduino package (1.6.23 or higher)

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

Chip Select
~~~~~~~~~~~

The chip select pin of the AD5686 is hardware configurable and routed to 3
general purpose I/O pins on the board. Use the table below to change the
location of the chip select simply by moving the shunt on P21, and ensuring the
software is configured the same way. By default the chip select is located on
GPIO 10. This feature allows multiple boards using SPI communications protocol
to be stacked on top of each other.

================= ==========
Chip Select (P21) GPIO (P16)
================= ==========
Pins 1 & Pin 2    GPIO 8
Pins 3 & Pin 4    GPIO 9
Pins 5 & Pin 6    GPIO 10
================= ==========

Configuring the Software
------------------------

The software for EVAL-CN0410 does not require any particular configurations in order to setup the application. The only setting that the user could make would be the selection of the CS pin. This can be done by modifying the **SYNC_PIN** inside **adi_cn0410.h**.

::

   #define SYNC_PIN    10

Outputting Data
---------------

After the application starts the user can send commands to set the output of the
DAC channels. Available commands:

-  set_a value
-  set_b value
-  set_c value
-  set_zero - resets all channels to 0

The value can be between 0 and 65535.

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the hardware and software is configured, user needs to follow on screen
instructions to run EVAL-CN0410 demo.

Following is the UART configuration.

::

     Both NL and CR
     9600 baud

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

We recommend not opening the project directly, but rather make a local copy in
your workspace and open it using Arduino/Genuino IDE.

The source code and include files of the **CN0410_example** can be found here:

.. admonition:: Download
   :class: download

   
   :git-arduino:`CN0410_example at Github <Arduino%20Uno%20R3/examples/CN0410_example>`
   

Project Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CN0410_example is a C++ Arduino sketch.

All files are in the same folder as the .ino file and include the source and
header files related to CN0411 software application that implement the CLI
interface and functionality.
