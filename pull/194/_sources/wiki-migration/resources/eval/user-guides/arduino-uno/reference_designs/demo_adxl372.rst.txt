Impact Measurement Demo using the Arduino Uno
=============================================

This demo will use **EVAL-ADXL372-ARDZ** shield along with **Arduino Uno** base board to create a impact measurement application, using the Arduino IDE.

|image1|

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The **ADXL372_example** project uses the **EVAL-ADXL372-ARDZ** shield which has an ADXL372 accelerometer. The ADXL372 is configured to operate in "Instant On" mode which means that the device is powered down, until the sensor records an impact event that triggers a threshold. Once that level is surpassed, the ADXL372 automatically goes into measurement mode to capture the rest of the impact event.

The **ADXL372** is an ultralow power, 3-axis, **±200 g** MEMS accelerometer.

.. important::

   To generate an impact event just hit the device with the palm of your hand.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  Arduino Uno Rev 3
   -  EVAL-ADXL372-ARDZ
   -  Type B to Type A USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADXL372_example sketch
   -  Arduino Interactive Development Environment(IDE)

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

-  Plug the **EVAL-ADXL372-ARDZ** shield on top of the **Arduino Uno** development board by matching up the **POWER, ANALOG, DIGI0, DIGI1** connectors.

   -  Note, the boards should only plug together one way, preventing reverse
      connections.

-  Make sure the jumpers **P10, P11, P12** are configured exactly as the picture below.

   -  P10 -> Pin 1-2
   -  P11 -> Pin 1-2
   -  P12 -> Pin 1-2

-   Plug in the Type B USB cable into the USB port on the Arduino Uno, and the
    other end into the PC or laptop.

Project Structure
-----------------

   :align: center
   :width: 700

The Arduino Sketch is used to load the example into Arduino IDE. The project is
composed of three main parts:

-  the main program (arduino sketch)
-  application layer (IC drivers and sensor data)
-  communication layer

Configuring the Software Parameters
-----------------------------------

Configure the activity threshold in the *ADXL372.h* file.

::

   #define ACT_VALUE          30     /* Activity threshold value */

Configure the inactivity value in the *ADXL372.h* file.

::

   #define ACT_VALUE          30     /* Activity threshold value */

Set the Accelerometer activity Timer in the *ADXL372.h* file.

::

   #define ACT_TIMER          1    /* Activity timer value in multiples of 3.3ms */

Set the Accelerometer inactivity Timer in the *ADXL372.h* file.

::

   #define INACT_TIMER        1     /* Inactivity timer value in multiples of 26ms */

Configure the INT1 pin. (Depending on the ADXL_INT1_SELECT jumper the pin can be
pin 7 for INT1_A and pin 6 for INT1_B)

::

   #define ADXL_INT1_PIN     7

Configure the INT2 pin. (Depending on the ADXL_INT2_SELECT jumper the pin can be
pin 5 for INT2_A and pin 4 for INT2_B)

::

   #define ADXL_INT2_PIN     5

Compiling, Verifying, and Programming
-------------------------------------

-  Once the project has been imported and the software parameters have been appropriately configured, you must Compile/Verify the project within the Arduino IDE. You can do this by clicking on the Sketch menu, and then on the *Compile/Verify* option.
-  Once the project is compiled and free of errors, you can now upload the project to the Arduino Uno. Click on the Sketch menu item, and then click *Upload*.

These two steps can also be done using the quick buttons on the Arduino sketch.
Check out the image below for locations of the quick buttons.

Outputting Data
---------------

Data is output using the USB cable from the Arduino to the PC. The USB port acts
as a serial terminal to display the data being transmitted via UART. Opening the
serial terminal window from the Arduino IDE is very easy, simply click on the
button shown in the picture below.

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may need to configure the serial terminal depending on the current settings
of the Arduino IDE. Make sure the settings are as follows:

::

     Select COM Port
     Baud rate: 9600
     Data: 8 bit
     Parity: none
     Stop: 1 bit
     Flow Control: none

Tools Download and Help
-----------------------

The Arduino tools are easy to use, and there are many tutorials and users guides
to help learn how to use the Arduino IDE.
