Workspace and Projects
======================

A CCES workspace is a folder (e.g. c:\\Users\\anon\\cces\\2.6.0) that contains project resources and metadata. When projects are created or imported, details about that project are stored in the workspace. The workspace metadata also includes preferences set through the CCES Preferences dialog box and IDE window layouts. By default, CCES creates new projects within your workspace folder.

Each time you start CCES, you will be prompted for a workspace location. You can opt to default to a workspace directory by choosing to use a workspace directory as your default. You will not be prompted the next time you open CCES.

How to add startup code and core components to a new project for the ADuCM3029
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An out-of-the-box ADuCM3029 project does not have startup code or a linker description file that maps code and data. It is necessary to add these components using the Run-time Environment (RTE) Configuration Editor.

CrossCore Projects created for Analog Devices' Cortex-M based processors, such as ADuCM3029 include a system.rteconfig file. Opening this file within the IDE will open the RTE Configuration Editor. Components from the CMSIS-Pack, such as drivers and services, can be added to a project by selecting them in the editor and clicking Save.

At minimum, a new ADuCM3029 project will require the Device::Startup, CMSIS::Core and Device::Global Configuration components to be added to the project.

-  Double-click on the system.rteconfig to open the RTE Configuration Editor.
-  Select Device::Startup, CMSIS::Core and Device::Global Configuration.
-  Click Save (Ctrl+S)
-  *You can also choose Device::Startup and click the Resolve button to add dependant components*
