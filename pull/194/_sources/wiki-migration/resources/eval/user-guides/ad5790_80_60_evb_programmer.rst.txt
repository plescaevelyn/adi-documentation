-  When the evaluation board is identified by the software, a prompt will appear for the user to select the evaluation software to reprogram the board to. If the evaluation board is currently configured for use with legacy software, then the user must select the actual device on the board before clicking the 'ACE' button for the software to program it with the correct board ID.
