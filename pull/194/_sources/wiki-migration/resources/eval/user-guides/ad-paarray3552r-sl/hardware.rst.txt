AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL Hardware User Guide
======================================

Introduction
============

The :adi:`AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL` is designed in a small form factor to manage the power sequencing of an RF transmitter signal chain, and is engineered to facilitate power sequencing for a two-stage Doherty amplifier (LDMOS + GaN) along with a one-stage Doherty amplifier (GaN only). However, users have the freedom to employ any GaN amplifiers of their choice.

The design incorporates the :adi:`AD3552R` dual-channel, 16-bit DAC which allows an ultrafast sub-µs voltage settling time of GaN gates from pinch-off to the normal operating voltage.

This also includes a high-side NMOS static switch driver, :adi:`LTC7000`, which adeptly handles key fault events such as overvoltage, overcurrent, and overtemperature.

The on-board :adi:`MAX32666` ultralow power Arm Cortex®-M4 microcontroller exposes all the necessary debug and programming features to enable a complete software development experience with the system. The system's firmware is based on ADI's open-source no-OS framework and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for evaluation and further development.

The system can be powered from an external +38 V to +55 V supply, making it
suitable for applications requiring high current capabilities.

Board Modification
------------------

.. container:: indent

   
   The AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL requires some hardware modifications, which will
   depend on the amplifier you plan to use. Here are the parameters that need
   modification before using the board:
   
   -  Fault Settings
   -  Inrush Current Limiter
   
   **Fault Settings**

   
   .. container:: indent

      The hardware is capable of detecting fault events such as overvoltage,
      overcurrent, and overtemperature. Below are the default settings for these
      fault events. You will need to adjust these settings based on the power
      amplifier you are using.

         
         -  Overvoltage: +55 V
         -  Undervoltage: +38 V
         -  Overcurrent: 3.5 A
         -  Overtemperature: +75°C
         
         **Overvoltage Settings.** The LTC7000s OVLO pin is responsible for the overvoltage event. If the voltage on this pin exceeds 1.21V, an overvoltage fault will be flagged. Below are the default resistor values for a +55V and +60V overvoltage. Adjust the following resistor values to set your desired overvoltage. Refer to :adi:`LTC7000` datasheet for more information.
         
         -  +55 V overvoltage
         
            -  R3, R114 = 1Meg
            -  R4, R115 = 22.6K
         
         -  +60 V overvoltage
         
            -  R24 = 1Meg
            -  R25 = 21K
         
         **Undervoltage Settings.** The LTC7000s RUN pin is responsible for the undervoltage event. If the voltage on this pin falls below 1.11V, an undervoltage fault will be flagged. Below are the default resistor values for a +38V and +6V undervoltage. Adjust the following resistor values to set your desired undervoltage. (Please note that the LTC7000 does not support a fault flag on its FAULT pin when an undervoltage event occurs, so we are unable to detect this kind of fault. However, the device will automatically shut off in such a case.) Refer to :adi:`LTC7000` datasheet for more information.
         
         -  +38 V undervoltage
         
            -  R156, R177 = 1Meg
            -  R172, R160 = 29.4K
         
         -  +6 V undervoltage
         
            -  R26 = 1Meg
            -  R23 = 221K
         
         **Overcurrent Settings.** The LTC7000s SNS and ISET pin are responsible for the overvoltage event. Below are the default resistor values for a 3.5 A overcurrent. Adjust the following resistor values to set your desired overcurrent. Refer to :adi:`LTC7000` datasheet for more information.
         
         -  R9, R31, R120 = 0.015 (R_SENSE)
         -  R12, R34, R123 = 105K (R_ISET)
         
         **Overtemperature Settings.** The MAX6516 is responsible for the overvoltage event. You can adjust the hysteresis to your desired value.

   **Inrush Current Limiter**

   
   .. container:: indent

         
         Driving large capacitive loads such as complex electrical systems with large bypass capacitors should be powered using the circuit shown in the Figure below.\ |image2|\ **Figure 5. Inrush Current Limiter Circuit**
         
         The pull-up gate drive to the power MOSFET from TGUP is passed through
         an RC delay network, RG and CG, which greatly reduces the turn-on ramp
         rate of the MOSFET. This dramatically reduces the inrush current from
         the source supply and reduces the transient ramp rate of the load
         allowing for slower activation of sensitive electrical loads such as
         power amplifiers.
         
         The turn-off of the MOSFET is not affected by the RC delay network as
         the pull-down for the MOSFET gate is directly from the TGDN pin. Note
         that the voltage rating on capacitor CG needs to be the same or higher
         than the external MOSFET and CLOAD.
         
         The values for RG and CG to limit the inrush current can be calculated from the below equation:|image3|
         
         On this application, we will use a <100mA inrush current.
         
         -  Inrush current = 100mA
         -  CLOAD = 20uF (HMC8500 Drain Bypass Capacitor)
         -  CG = 10nF (assumed)
         
         Using the formula above, RG = 200K.

         Note: The default inrush current circuitry (RG, RS, CG) on the board is
         not populated. The user will need to modify the board and install the
         appropriate values before using it.

   -  Turn on the +28V bench power supply once again. You will notice that DS3 (Green LED) lights up, indicating proper power-up.\ |image10|\ **Figure 12. Overall Hardware Setup**
   -  Open the GUI Application. In the GUI Homepage, click the **Go** button under "Device Monitoring and Control".\ |image11|\ **Figure 13. GUI Homepage**
   -  It will show the GUI dashboard. On the device connection, choose the correct Serial Port. Then, press the "Connect" button.
   -  Wait until the HW-SW connection is successful.
   -  In the software setup section, you will find the complete details about the GUI.
   -  The user can perform either a manual power-up/down sequence or an automatic power-up/down sequence.
   -  For the manual power sequence, the user needs to manually adjust the knobs, sliders, and buttons under the "Control Group" section in the GUI according to the amplifier's drain and gate voltage requirements.\ |image12|\ **Figure 14. GUI Control Group**
   -  For the automatic power sequence, the user only needs to press the "Start" button of the power-up under the "Device Group" section in the GUI. It will automatically perform the power-up sequencing requirement of the HMC8500. Please note that the automatic power sequencing has default gate voltage levels designed for the HMC8500 GaN Power Amplifier.\ |image13|\ **Figure 15. GUI Device Group**
   -  To change the default voltages in the automatic power sequencing, the user needs to modify the source code according to their power amplifier requirement.
   -  Once properly powered up, turn on the RF signal generator. On the signal analyzer, you should see an amplifier RF output signal of around +12 dBm at 2.4 GHz, indicating a successful power-up.\ |image14|\ **Figure 16. RF Output**
   -  To power down, press the "Start" button of the power-down sequence and it
      automatically performs the power-down sequence requirement of the HMC8500.

Power Sequencing
----------------

.. container:: indent

   The system exhibits an automated bias sequencing required by a power
   amplifier which minimizes human intervention and possible device damage. The
   default bias sequence implemented follows the common GaN power amplifier
   sequencing as shown below.

|image15| |image16| **Figure 8. Power Sequence**

AD3552R DAC Settling Time
-------------------------

.. container:: indent

   The system enables an ultrafast sub-µs voltage settling time for GaN gates
   from pinch-off to the normal operating voltage by utilizing the AD3553R
   dual-channel, ultrafast, 16-bit DAC. This rapid voltage transition allows the
   board to meet the TDD switching requirements for biasing a GaN amplifier in
   RF front-end applications, such as 5G base station radio units.

   
   The typical voltage transition time from GaN pinch-off to its normal
   operating voltage is shown in the figure below.

Fault Event
-----------

.. container:: indent

   The system can protect itself against undesirable fault incidents, such as overvoltage, overcurrent, and overtemperature events. The on-board :adi:`LTC7000` handles overvoltage (OV) and overcurrent (OC) fault detection, while the :adi:`MAX6516` is responsible for temperature monitoring and detection.

   
   The table below shows the preset threshold for each parameter.
   
   .. container:: center round box

         
         =============== =====================
         Safety Features 
         =============== =====================
         Fault Event     Fault Threshold Limit
         Overvoltage     +55 V
         Overcurrent     3.5 A
         Overtemperature +75°C
         =============== =====================
         

   
   .. tip::

      Users can define the fault threshold limits based on their application by adjusting resistor values. Consult the `schematic <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/pa_array/02_079905d_top.pdf>`_ for the resistor values.

   

Fault Time Response
-------------------

.. container:: indent

   The system also exhibits fast fault detection and flagging.

   
   **Figure 10** shows the time elapsed from when the LTC7000 detects a fault to when it sends a signal to the microcontroller. Under normal conditions, the FAULT pin of the LTC7000 remains HIGH. When a fault event occurs, the FAULT pin is pulled to GND. The system took almost 1 µs to register the fault flag time.

   **Figure 10. Fault Detected Time**
   
   **Figure 11** shows the time it takes for the microcontroller to process the fault signal coming from the LTC7000 and perform the required power-down sequencing. The system took almost 5 µs to register the fault flag time.

   Figure 12 shows the temperature of the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL board in normal
   operating conditions. This is the situation when all of the bias pins are
   sourcing their specified loads under normal operations.
