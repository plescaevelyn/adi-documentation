Embedded Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`AD-PAARRAY3552R` is accompanied by an open-source software stack and associated collaterals, enabling a complete experience from evaluation and prototyping all the way to production firmware and applications development.

The system's firmware is based on Analog Devices' open-source :doc:`ADI's no-OS framework </wiki-migration/resources/no-os>`, which includes most of the tools required for embedded code development and debugging as well as libraries enabling host-side connectivity for system configuration and data transfer over UART.

Updating the Firmware
---------------------

.. container:: indent

   The most common way of programming the system is by dragging and dropping the provided .hex file to the DAPLINK drive. Using the drag-and-drop method, the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the easiest way to get started with the reference design.

   


Setting up the MAX32625PICO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: indent

   To update the board's firmware, a new bootloader has to be flashed on the MAX32625PICO. Follow below procedure:

   
   -   Download the firmware image: `MAX32625PICO Firmware <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/pa_array/max32625_max32666fthr_if_crc_swd_v1.0.5.bin.zip>`_
   -   Do not connect the MAX32625PICO from the PC and the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL board.
   -   Plug the micro-USB cable only in the MAX32625PICO.
   -   Press the button on the MAX32625PICO and then plug the other end of the micro-USB cable into the PC. **(Do not release the button until the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)**.

   -   Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
   -   Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
   -   After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and the MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware of the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL board.
   


Programming the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: indent

   
   -   Connect the MAX32625PICO to the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL board using the 10-pin ribbon cable.
   -   Connect the 48 V power supply to the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL. Make sure the board is powered up for the next steps.
   -   A DAPLINK drive should appear as mounted on the PC.
   -   Drag and drop the **AD-PAARRAY3552R-SLv1.0.0.hex** into the DAPLINK drive. After a few seconds, the drive will be remounted.
   -   Check the DAPLINK directory and make sure there is no **FAIL.TXT** file. In case there is, repeat the drag and drop step. Otherwise, the MAX32625PICO can now be disconnected from the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL, since the firmware update is complete.

Application Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The system also integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) that continuously monitors crucial parameters. This interface facilitates complete system control, enabling faster prototyping and development.
