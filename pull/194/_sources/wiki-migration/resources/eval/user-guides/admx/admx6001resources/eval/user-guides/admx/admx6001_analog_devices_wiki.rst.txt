GENERAL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

The ADMX6001-EBZ is a reference design of a DC-coupled single channel 10GSPS digitizer featuring the AD9213, a low noise, 12-bit high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) :adi:`AD9213` and the AD4080, a 20-bit precision ADC :adi:`AD4080`. The dual-path design achieves true low noise digitization in the broad band from DC to 5GHz. By biasing the ADC driver ADL5580 :adi:`en/products/adl5580`.html with the precision digital-to-analog converter (DAC) LTC2664 :adi:`en/products/ltc2664`.html, it is capable of handling unipolar and bipolar signals at various DC levels, maximizing utility of the input dynamic range of AD9213. This design is ideal for high performance time-domain instruments such as time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS), distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS), and digital oscilloscope.

This document guides the setup and evaluation of the ADMX6001-EBZ board in conjunction with the Xilinx VCU118 field programmable gate array (FPGA) board.

HARDWARE SETUP
--------------

The ADMX6001-EBZ board operates with Xilinx VCU118 FPGA board that serves as the controller for configuring the ADMX6001-EBZ board and streams captured data to a PC for post processing.

The hardware setup includes the following components:

-  ADMX6001-EBZ board (the power adapter is included in the ADMX6001-EBZ package)
-  Xilinx VCU118 FPGA board (the power adapter is included in the Xilinx VCU118 package)
-  2x Micro-USB cables
-  Ethernet cable
-  Signal generator
-  PC running Windows 10 or 11

The 12V power adapters for the ADMX6001-EBZ board and the Xilinx VCU118 FPGA board must be unplugged from the wall outlets before inserting into the barrel connector (P4) on the ADMX6001-EBZ board and the power connector on the Xilinx VCU118 FPGA board with the VCU118 power switch in the OFF position.

Figure 2 shows the connection of the ADMX6001-EBZ board to the Xilinx VCU118 FPGA board via a FMC+ connector and other cables for the connection of power supplies, USB, Ethernet, and the test signal from the signal generator. The Micro-USB cables and Ethernet cable are connected to the PC via a USB adapter if needed. An example of the complete setup is shown in Figure 3. A small bench-top fan is required for heat dissipation of the ADMX6001-EBZ board (refer to Figure 3).

AD4080 DATA INTERFACE CONFIGURATION REGISTERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD4080 low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) data interface is highly configurable. In the ADMX6001-EBZ design, the AD4080 is configured to output the result data on single data lane. The AD4080 data interface configuration Register 0x15 and Register 0x16 need to be configured so that the Xilinx VCU118 controls are aligned with AD4080 conversion data for correct data output.

Complete the following steps for setting the AD4080 data interface configuration registers:

-  AD4080 Register 0x15 set to 0x50 to enable the fixed pattern test, as shown in Figure 26. This step sets AD4080 in test mode.
-  In test mode, the 20-bit AD4080 data is expected to be binary 1010 1100 0101 1101 0110, decimal −342570, or hexadecimal 0xAC5D6. Save the AD4080 data to a .csv file in IIO Oscilloscope and check the value. Refer to the ADMX6001-EBZ Data Acquisition With IIO Oscilloscope section for saving data in IIO Oscilloscope.
-  If the AD4080 data is different from the expected decimal −342570, set the AD4080 Register 0x15 to one of the following values: 0x51, 0x61, 0x71, 0x81, 0x91, 0x01, 0x11, 0x21, 0x31, or 0x41, as shown in Figure 27. Save the data to a .csv file and check the value. Repeat this step with a value in the list until the AD4080 data is exactly −342570. The AD4080 register setting is completed.
-  Set AD4080 Register 0x15 back to 0x40 to disable the fixed pattern test and enable AD4080 normal mode.

The AD4080 data interface configuration registers are set and the AD4080 is ready for data acquisition.

IIO-OSCILLOSCOPE PLOT WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data captured by the the AD9213 high-speed path and the AD4080 precision path can be visualized and saved to a .csv file in the IIO Oscilloscope plot window, as shown in Figure 28 and Figure 29.

   *Figure 29. IIO Oscilloscope Plot Window—Time Domain: ad4080*


The two data paths are listed in the top-left corner. Check one or both and then click the Capture/Stop button to view the data stream. For the IIO Oscilloscope to work smoothly, it is recommended that the number of samples is set to power of 2, such as 2\ :sup:`10` (1024) or 2\ :sup:`16` (65536). The IIO Oscilloscope supports only one scale for each axis so that it is not practical to view the AD9213 high-speed path and the AD4080 precision path simultaneously because the AD9213 (10GSPS) high-speed path is 320 times faster than the AD4080 (31.25MSPS) precision path for the horizontal axis and AD4080 (20-bit) has higher bit resolution than AD9213 (12-bit) for the vertical axis in the ADMX6001-EBZ design.

The IIO Oscilloscope plot window can also view the captured data in the frequency domain. An example of a 2MHz sinewave captured by AD4080 is shown in Figure 30.


|image18|

.. container:: centeralign

   *Figure 30. IIO Oscilloscope Plot Window—Frequency Domain*


The data can be saved in a .csv file for post processing and analysis, as shown in Figure 31. From the File menu, select Save As to open the Save As window. Make sure to select the path from the dropdown list and select the correct checkbox before clicking the Save button on bottom-right.

   *Figure 31. Save Data as a .CSV File in the IIO Oscilloscope Plot Window*


INPUT SIGNAL OFFSET SHIFT FOR AD9213
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input signal is often from transducers or sensors as a unipolar signal with DC offset, whereas the AD9213 works best with differential input. By biasing the ADL5580 input terminal with the output of the precision DAC LTC2664, the ADL5580 converts the unipolar signal to a differential signal with an adjustable DC offset to maximize the utility of the AD9213 input dynamic range. The actual use case may vary depending on the specific application.

The DAC value of 32768 corresponds to 0V and is used as the default biasing to ADL5580. To achieve a targeted DC offset shift **x** mV, the DAC value can be calculated as

DAC value = 32768×(1 + **x** /5000)

where **x** is the DC offset in mV.

Round the DAC value to the nearest integer as the DAC LTC2664 input. The DAC output range is −5V to +5V.

To change the LTC2664 DAC value for ADL5580 biasing, write the DAC value as raw data to output_voltage0, as shown in Figure 32. To illustrate the effect of offset shift, clear the Auto scale checkbox, set the Y max to 2048, and set the Y min to −2048. Figure 33 through Figure 35 show the AD9213 high-speed path data with the same sinewave input but different DAC settings for offset shift.

   *Figure 48. Install Additional Libraries and Run Python Scripts for ADMX6001-EBZ Evaluation Board*


The Python scripts call modules in the PyADI-IIO library to initialize the ADMX6001-EBZ board by setting required registers, JSED and LVDS data lanes, and other control signals. Examples of Python scripts can be found at the product page for the ADMX6001-EBZ.

RUN EXAMPLE PYTHON SCRIPTS FOR THE ADMX6001-EBZ
-----------------------------------------------

Examples of Python scripts are provided on the ADMX6001-EBZ board product page for board evaluation. These Python scripts call modules in the PyADI-IIO library to initialize the ADMX6001-EBZ board by setting required registers, JSED and LVDS data lanes, and other control signals. The user is encouraged to check the product page of the ADMX6001-EBZ board for updated and/or additional examples of Python scripts.

The example script **ADMX6001_MultiClass_pCal.py** defines the classes to setup, initiate, configure, and operate the ADMX6001-EBZ for data acquisition and visualization. A list of useful methods defined in this script for operating the setup of the ADMX6001-EBZ board and the Xilinx VCU118 board follows.

-  AD4080_CAl(self): configure the AD4080 LVDS data interface, Register 0x15 and Register 0x16, for correct data output.

-  set_dac_offset(self, voltage): set the DC offset in mV for the AD9213 path. By setting the appropriate DC offset, the signal can be moved up or down for maximizing the dynamic range of the AD9213.

-  capture_data_ad9213(self, nsamples): the AD9213 captures data of nsamples at 10GSPS.

-  capture_data_ad4080(self, nsamples): the AD4080 captures data of nsamples at 31.25MSPS.

-  plot_data_ad9213(self, data): plot data captured by the AD9213.

-  plot_data_ad4080(self, data): plot data captured by by AD4080.
