AD-PZSDR2400TDD-EB User Guide
=============================

The :adi:`AD-PZSDR2400TDD-EB` is affectionately dubbed the first 'RF personality card'. It plugs into the ADRV1CRR-FMC :adi:`en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADRV1CRR-FMC.html` carrier card. 35mm U.FL coaxial cables connect the card to the ADRV9361-Z7035 :adi:`en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADRV9361-Z7035.html#eb-overview` providing access to the transmit and receive inputs of the :adi:`AD9361`. Information on the card, how to use it, the design package that surrounds it, and the software which can make it work, can be found here.

The purpose of the :adi:`AD-PZSDR2400TDD-EB` is to provide the user with a tunable path to condition the transmit or receive signals of the :adi:`AD9361`. Selection of TX or RX path is achieved by the 200MHz to 2.7GHz SPDT switch :adi:`HMC546LP2` controlled by the FPGA and accompanying software. The transmit path consists of a 2.4GHz filter, half watt driver amplifier :adi:`ADL5324` and 2 watt power amplifier :adi:`HMC921`. The receive path consists of the same 2.4GHz filter as well as a low loss LNA :adi:`HMC669`.
