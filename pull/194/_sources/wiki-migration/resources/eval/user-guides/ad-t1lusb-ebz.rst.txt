Overview
--------

The AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ board is an interface between USB 2.0 and a 10BASE-T1L interface.

The current hardware configuration provides a straightforward architecture with a USB Ethernet Controller and MAC (`LAN9500A <https://wiki.analog.com/http/www.microchip.com/en-us/product/lan9500a>`_) connected through MII to the :adi:`ADIN1100` PHY.

The design also includes an EEPROM for saving and recalling MAC configurations and status LEDs to indicate link status (MAC) and user-programmable status flags from the PHY.

The AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ board doesn't require any configuration to be functional and ready for use.

Setup Examples
--------------

The AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ board is intended to be ready for use out of the box to quickly control any system with a 10BASE-T1L interface.

A couple of design examples that have a 10BASE-T1L interface that will work together with the AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ board are:

-  :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` - Software-configurable Analog and Digital I/O with 10BASE-T1L Evaluation and Development Platform
-  :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL` - Arduino Form-factor Development Platform Based on MAX32690 ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller

.. tip::

   \ **Note:** The **AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ** will **send or receive data only** over a FROFIBUS/SPE cable, so any design with a 10BASE-T1L interface will need to be powered separately.

Network Testing
---------------

When the AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ board is connected to a computer via a USB cable, a new network interface should be available.

This can be verified by running on a shell terminal the **``ipconfig`` command on a Windows system** or **``ifconfig`` on a Linux system**.

The new network configuration which corresponds to the following example:

::

   Ethernet adapter Ethernet 3:

      Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
      Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::5079:d4ec:5a1:6387%63
      Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address. . : 169.254.193.171
      Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
      Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :

After this we can run the ``ping`` command as ``ping -t 169.254.193.171`` to obtain the following response if everything works properly:

::

   Pinging 169.254.193.171 with 32 bytes of data:

   Reply from 169.254.193.171: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128

In this way, we can confirm that the connection between a computer and the AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ board works as expected.
