**GMSL Deserializer Evaluation Kit (MAX96724)**

-  Flip the SW5 switches to the ON position - enables I2C communication over the
   CSI bus

.. note::

   Make sure you have all the PoC-related jumpers set to the corresponding VPOC_x point (ref. :adi:`datasheet <media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max96724-bak-evk-max96724r-bak-evk.pdf>` p. 15/22) (1 to 4 for the possible serializer inputs to the quad deserializer).

-  Example from the datasheet - J3 for SIOA input:

GMSL SerDes Evaluation Kits Validation and Switch Setup
-------------------------------------------------------

**MAX96724 Deserializer Evaluation Kit**

-  Please make sure that the **CFG** pins of the MAX96724 deserializer are set to low (0) - indicating a COAX - GMSL 2 connection between serializers and deserializer. The levels can be seen and changed by using the GMSL SerDes GUI :adi:`software <en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/embedded-development-software/software-download.html?swpart=SFW0019760I>`. You need to connect the MAX96724 kit to a host PC by using an USB cable and then refresh the application to see the added device.

**AD-GMSLCAMRPI-ADP# Adapter**

-  Configure the switches on the GMSL Deserializer adapter for **CAM2**.

System setup
------------

-  Write the `AMD KV260-based latest SD card image <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/gmsl>`_ on a 8GB (or more) SD card
-  Plug the SD card into the KV260 SD card slot
-  Connect the HDMI cable from the monitor to the HDMI connector of the KV260 evaluation kit
-  Connect the 2 Tier 4 C1 cameras to INA and INB of the deserializer kit (if you have only one camera, connect it to the INA port of the deserializer)
-  Connect the 15 pins camera cable between the Kria and the P1 connector of the interposer. **Make sure to use the cable with contacts on the same sides.**
-  Connect the 22 pin flex cable
-  Connect the **KV260 evaluation kit** to the power supply
-  Connect the **MAX96724 evaluation kit** to the power supply and put the corresponding switch in the **"ON"** position
-  KV260 will boot by default from QSPI. It must be forced to boot from SD card to correctly load the custom BOOT.BIN. For this please follow the guide `here <https://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/creating_applications/2022.1/build/html/docs/bootmodes.html>`_ and run **boot_sd** boot mode
-  Connect a USB mouse and keyboard to the KV260 evaluation kit. It's possible
   to use either a mouse & keyboard combo or a separate mouse and keyboard

.. note::

   Ubuntu credentials user:analog/pass:analog

.. note::

   To change the number of cameras that would be used in the setup, you would
   need to change the default devicetree binary that is located in the boot
   partition of the SD card to the corresponding number of cameras (between 1
   and 2), by overwriting the system.dtb to an one from the corresponding
   directory. The devicetree binary options are located in the bootfs partiiton
   (in nr_cams/1cam or 2cams directory/system.dtb). The bootfs partition can be
   mounted by using the mount utility: e.g. mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt.

   |image3|

.. note::

   The setup from the attached figure contains the two SWs of the GMSL
   Deserializer RPi adapter as follows: the SW1 set to the left side and the SW3
   oriented to the connected flex cable, in the upper part in this case,
   oriented to the P6 flex cable connector. In addition to the connections from
   the figure, please make sure that the Kria KV260 and MAX96724 evaluation kits
   are powered up using their corresponding power-related barrel jack
   connectors.

--------------

Running the evaluation application
----------------------------------

Once Linux boots you'll see on the HDMI monitor the Linux desktop and on the top left corner a shortcut to the script named **video_cfg.sh**. Double clicking on the icon will start the media-ctl configuration script. The script is running in background without any pop ups.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-gmslcamrpi-adp/kria_video_cfg.png
   :width: 600

After the script was executed once, one should double click on Qt V4L2 test Utility icon to start the video capture application. A window like bellow should open. First the user must select **video0** device by clicking the open icon.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-gmslcamrpi-adp/qv4l2_select_video_dev.png
   :width: 600

A new instance of Qt V4L2 test Utility should be started and selected **video1** this time. After this step the play button should be pressed on both Qt V4L2 test Utility instances. Video should be visible on the 2 windows.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-gmslcamrpi-adp/qv4l2_video.jpg
   :width: 600

OpenGL rendering is recommended to be disabled by accessing Qt V4L2 test Utility
capture menu. Capture will start only if both Qt V4L2 test Utility instances are
on play state. This is a current HDL limitation.

RTP-based Streaming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In order to do a streaming of the data that is captured from the cameras to
   an external machine, you can use the 1G Ethernet-based transmission available
   through the attached port of the KV260 evaluation kit and a streaming-related
   application such as the one available in the GStreamer framework (an e.g.
   would be the RTP-based streaming support for uncompressed data available in
   the GStreamer).

Power off sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Open a terminal and type **sudo poweroff**. This will safely power off the Kria and ensure that the SD card is properly unmounted
