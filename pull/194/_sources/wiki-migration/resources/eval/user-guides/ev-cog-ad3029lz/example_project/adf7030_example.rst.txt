ADF7030 INTERFACE WITH EV-COG-AD3029LZ
======================================

Introduction
------------

This document explains about the hardware and software setup, which is required to interface a ADF7030 radio transceiver with the EV-COG-AD3029LZ using SPI protocol. The entire setup is made simple with the use of AD-GEAR-DISPLAY1Z, which contains the slots for the ADF7030 Daughter Card.

The hardware details cover the COG jumper settings and also the pin mapping between the ADF7030-1 Daughter card and the EV-COG-AD3029LZ. The software details cover the software development kit required and the software architecture of the code base written to interface the ADF7030 Daughter card with the EV-COG-AD3029LZ.

Software Details
----------------

This section contains software related information about AD-GEAR-DISPLAY1Z and the EV-COG-AD3029-LZ and the application. Links are provided to the user guides, BSPs, software tool chains and the example project at the end of this page.

Application files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A library consisting of ADF7030-1 specific drivers are provided for interfacing the radio module with the host controller.

The example software provided consists of the following,

-  Three example application projects:

   -  OfflineCalibration

      -  TxPacket
      -  RxPacket

-  ADF7030-1 specific driver source files.

- The example application requires ADuCM302x-Rel2.0.0 BSP for IAR to be installed.

Software Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The software architecture for the ADF7030-1 applications is depicted below


|image3|

- The system specific APIs like SPI, UART, GPIO etc and present in the ADuCM302x-Rel2.0.0 BSP .

- The Radio control APIs are found in the Driver files provided within the project application folder.

- The 3 different projects (OfflineCalibration, RX_packet and TX_packet) share the same workspace but only one of them can be set as active at a time.

IDE Setup and example application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section covers the various steps involved in getting the RX_packet and TX_packet application code to run on EV-COG-AD3029LZ after the hardware setup is done.

Following are the steps involved,

-  Download and install IAR Embedded Workbench 7.60.1 or higher.
-  Download and Install TeraTerm or any equivalent Terminal emulator program
-  The ADF7030-1 project is available on `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.analog.com/projects/IOTTGAPPS/repos/adf7030-1-rf-support-for-3029/browse>`_.
-  Import the source into IAR workspace .
-  Set TX_packet as active project, build and flash it into the transmitter setup.
-  Now, set RX_packet as active project, build and flash it into the receiver setup.
-  open two instances of TeraTerm(Terminal emulator program) each for transmitter and Receiver, press reset on both setups and see RSSI and data being printed on the receiver terminal window.
