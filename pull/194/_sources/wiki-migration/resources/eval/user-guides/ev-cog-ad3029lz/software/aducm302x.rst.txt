Analog Devices ADuCM302x Device Support Pack
============================================

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The ADuCM302x Device Family Pack (DFP) provides access to all the necessary on-chip peripheral drivers for both the :adi:`ADuCM3029` and the :adi:`ADuCM3027` devices. This software layer is the foundation layer needed when writing applications using this microprocessor family. When combined with the EV-COG-AD3029LZ software pack as well as the Sensors software pack, there are many great Internet of Things(IoT) applications and demos that can be replicated using the EV-COG-AD3029LZ development platform.

The following on-chip drivers are provided as part of the ADuCM302x Device Family Pack:
