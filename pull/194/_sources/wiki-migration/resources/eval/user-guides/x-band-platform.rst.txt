X-Band Phased Array Development Platform User Guide
===================================================

Product Details
---------------

The :adi:`X-Band Development Platform <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/x-band-development-platform.html>` contains one :adi:`AD9081-FMCA-EBZ <eval-ad9081>` AD9081 MxFE Evaluation Board, one :doc:`ADXUD1AEBZ </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/xud1a>` X/C Band Up/Down Converter, and one :doc:`ADAR1000EVAL1Z </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/stingray>` X/Ku-Band Analog Beamforming Board. The target application is phased array radars, electronic warfare, and ground-based SATCOM, specifically a X Band 32 transmit/32 receive channel hybrid beamforming phased array.

The X-Band Development Platform highlights a complete system solution. It is intended as a testbed for demonstrating hybrid beamforming phased array radar as well as the implementation of system level calibrations, beamforming algorithms, and other signal processing algorithms. The system is designed to mate with a `ZCU102 <https://www.xilinx.com/ZCU102>`_ Evaluation Board from Xilinx®, featuring the Zynq® UltraScale+™ ZU9EG FPGA, with provided reference software, HDL code, and MATLAB system-level interfacing.

The system can be used to enable quick time-to-market development programs for applications like:

-  ADEF (Phased-Array, RADAR, EW, SATCOM)
-  Hybrid Beamforming
-  Electronic Test and Measurement

General Description
===================

This user guide serves as the main source of information for system engineers and software developers using the X-Band Phased Array Development Platform. The target application is phased array radars, electronic warfare, and ground-based SATCOM, specifically a 32-channel transmit/32 receive hybrid beamforming phased array phased array at X-Band (8 GHz to 12 GHz).

The system platform highlights a complete system solution. It is intended as a testbed for demonstrating phased array system level calibrations, hybrid beam forming (analog/digital) algorithms, and other signal processing algorithms. The board is designed to mate with a `ZCU102 <https://www.xilinx.com/ZCU102>`_ Evaluation Board from Xilinx®, which features the Zynq® UltraScale+™ ZU9EG FPGA, with provided reference software and HDL code.
