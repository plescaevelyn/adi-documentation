Configuring the ADIN1300 for Ethernet PHY Compliance Test Modes
===============================================================

Overview
--------

The purpose of this application note is to describe the configuration of the
ADIN1300 for the various Ethernet PHY compliance test modes as set out by
IEEE802.3.

The ADIN1300 supports the IEEE test modes, Test Mode 1, Test Mode 2, Test Mode 3
and Test Mode 4 used for 1000BASE-T IEEE compliance testing. The ADIN1300 has
some additional test modes that are useful for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX
compliance testing. Details of the registers, sequences of writes are captured
in this document. Use this application note in conjunction with the product
datasheet.

Testing Equipment and Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When performing this testing, user will need Ethernet compliance test fixture
and associated Ethernet physical layer compliance software. There are a number
of vendors provide Ethernet Compliance test equipment. For ADI in-house
validation, we used Tektronix TDSET3 compliance software in addition to having
UNH (University of New Hampshire perform compliance testing).

Once equipment is in place and hardware powered and connected to the test
fixture, configure the PHY through the MDIO interface to set the required test
mode and use the compliance software to record and report the results.

Reset Between Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure the device is in a known state, either start from a power cycle or
alternatively, issue the following writes to reset the device with fresh read of
the hardware configuration.

-  GE_SFT_RST_CFG_EN.Write(0b1) - Register 0xFF0D to ensure the hardware configuration is refreshed.
-  GE_SFT_RST. Write(0b1) - Register 0xFF0C subsystem reset

Extended Register Addressing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADIN1300 supports a range of extended management interface registers which
can be accessed using Clause 45 access or alternatively using Clause 22 access
through the EXT_REG_PTR (address 0x0010) and EXT_REG_DATA (address 0x0011),
these registers provide user ability to read/write to the extended register
space (any register greater than 0x001F) indirectly. If using Clause 22 access,
write the 16-bit register address into the EXT_REG_PTR register and then read or
write the EXT_REG_DATA register.

1000BASE-T Testing
------------------

IEEE Test Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADIN1300 supports the IEEE test modes, Test Mode 1, Test Mode 2, Test Mode 3
and Test Mode 4 used for 1000BASE-T IEEE compliance testing. An IEEE test mode
can be selected by writing to register address 9, bits 15:13. The TST_MODE bit
field can be used to select the transmit test waveforms required for Gigabit
IEEE compliance testing.

-  Test Mode 1 is used for testing of the 1000BASE-T transmitter waveform.
-  Test Mode 2 and 3 are used for testing of the 1000BASE-T transmitter jitter.
-  Test Mode 4 is used testing of the 1000BASE-T transmitter distortion.

1000BASE-T Test Modes (Master Slave Control Register)

Address: 0x09: Reset, 0x0200, Name: MSTR_SLV_CONTROL This address corresponds to
the MASTER-SLAVE Control register specified in clause 40.5.1.1 of IEEE Std
802.3. Only Test mode bits are show in table below, refer to datasheet register

are:

-  Link Pulse Testing

10BASE-T is configured by writing the following register – include it in the sequence above if 10BASE-T operation is required.

-  B_10_E_EN.Write(0x0) - 10BASE-Te is enabled by default, write 0 to configure
   10BASE-T.

Testing Using ADI Evaluation GUI
--------------------------------

The ADI evaluation board uses small MDIO dongle board for USB to MDIO
communications and the accompanying GUI provides access to the various Test
modes from the “Test Mode” tab. Select the relevant test mode to configure and
“Execute Test”. In the “Activity log” the register writes can be observed.
