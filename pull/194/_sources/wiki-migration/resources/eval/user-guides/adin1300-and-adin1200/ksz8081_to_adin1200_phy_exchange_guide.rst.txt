         **Overview**

         
         This PHY exchange guide captures pertinent information to support
         migration from the MicroChip KSZ8081MNX/RNB to the Analog Devices
         ADIN1200 Ethernet PHY. The ADIN1200 supports MII, RMII and RGMII MAC
         interfaces from the same package version, while the KZS8081MNX version
         supports a MII MAC interface and the KSZ8081RNB supports RMII. The PHYs
         have different pinouts, therefore the ADIN1200 is not a drop-in
         replacement for the Microchip product. This requires edits to the
         schematic and board layout to achieve this exchange. The following
         sections detail the modifications at the schematic level required to
         migrate from KSZ8081 to the ADIN1200 device.
         
         Hardware Changes By Function
         
         **Power Supplies Overview**

         
         The supply requirements are listed in Table 1. Both devices can operate
         from a minimum of one 3.3V power supply rail AVDD_3P3 (VDDA_3.3V),
         where the VDDIO rail is connected to 3.3V. Both devices have an on chip
         voltage regulator to generate the internal core supply rail and
         provided to a pin for decoupling purposes.

            :width: 600
         
         The ADIN1200 is robust to power supply sequencing and the power can be
         applied in any order. The ADIN1200 provides two pins for each supply
         rail, whereas the Microchip device provides one power supply pin for
         each rail. The VDDIO supply rail powers the MAC interface and MDIO
         blocks, this can operate from 1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V. Decoupling
         requirements for each device differs as described in Table 2

            :width: 600
         
         **RESET Operation**

         
         An active low hardware reset pin, RESET_N (RST#) is provided on Pin 6
         of the ADIN1200 and pin 32 of the KSZ8081. The hardware strapping pins
         are read and updated at the de-assertion of reset for both devices. For
         the ADIN1200, the RESET_N pin resides in the AVDD_3P3 voltage domain,
         whereas for the Microchip device, the RST# pin is referenced to VDDIO.
         In applications where the MAC interface is powered from VDDIO of 1.8V,
         level shifting of the RESET_N signal applied to the ADIN1200 may be
         required to ensure the voltage level on the RESET_N pin is in excess of
         the minimum input high threshold level.
         
         **Clocking**

         
         A 25 MHz crystal or external clock source is used to provide the
         reference clock for both devices. In RMII mode, the ADIN1200 expects an
         external 50MHz REF_CLK provided to the XTAL_I/REF_CLK pin. The
         KSZ8081RNB (RMII mode) can provide a 50 MHz REF_CLK to the MAC device
         from the 25 MHz source. Alternatively, an external 50 MHz clock can be
         provided to both the PHY and MAC.
         
         **Bias Resistor**

         
         An external resistor, REXT is required to bias internal reference
         circuitry for both KSZ8081 and ADIN1200. The ADIN1200 requires a 3.01
         kΩ resistor (1% tolerance, 100 ppm/°C temperature coefficient)
         connected to pin 10. The KSZ8081 uses an 6.49 kΩ on pin 10.

            :width: 600
         
         **Media Dependent Interface (MDI)**

         
      The ADIN1200 has voltage mode line drivers with on-chip terminations so no external termination resistors are required and the center tap of the transformer does not require biasing to supply voltage. Both devices use voltage mode line drive for connection from the MDI_0:1_P/N (RXM/P, TXM/P) pins to the magnetics and RJ-45 line using the same external circuit. The recommended external circuit for the interface to the magnetics and RJ-45 is shown in Figure 1. The KSZ8081 is also a voltage mode PHY. |image1| **Figure 1 Isolation using Discrete Magnetics**

   
   .. container:: half column

         
         **MDIO/Management Interface**

         
         Both devices can be hardware strapped to be used in an unmanaged
         configuration. Alternatively, they can provide SMI/MII access over the
         two wire MDIO interface. The MDIO pin (Management Data Open Drain
         Input/Output) for SMI/MII interface to MAC and requires an external
         pullup resistor. The recommended value for ADIN1200 is a 1.5kΩ resistor
         connected to pin 24. The KSZ8081 recommends 1kΩ connected to pin 11. A
         hardware interrupt output pin INT_N (INTRP) is provided in both devices
         and is open drain. The recommended value for ADIN1200 is a 1.5kΩ
         resistor connected to INT_N pin 27. The KSZ8081 recommends 1kΩ
         connected to INTRP, pin 21.
         
         **LED Function**

         
         Both devices support two LED pins. The ADIN1200 pins are LED_0 and
         LINK_ST. The LED_0 has programmability of LED functions, with different
         blinking operation possible through MDIO configuration, the default
         mode is ON when Link is Up, blink if activity. The LINK_ST provides
         static information about Link up or down status. The KSZ8081 pins are
         LED0, LED1, where LED0 can be configured for On/Off and Blink if
         activity while LED1 can be configured to indicate 10 or 100M link
         speed. Both devices use these pins for Speed and Auto-Neg strapping
         purposes.
         
         **LED Circuit**

         
         The ADIN1200 LED_0 operates from the AVDD_3P3 voltage domain, therefore can support driving LEDs even when the MAC interface is running at the lower voltage of 1.8V. The KSZ8081 LED circuits operate from the VDDIO domain. The default LED operation is on if the Link is up and blinks when there is activity, this operation can be reprogrammed through MDIO write. For the LED_0 of the ADIN1200, it can be configured with 4-level strapping. The strapping configuration will have an impact on how the LED function operates, and needs to be considered if the LED pins are used to directly drive an LED. If the strap pin is pulled high by the strapping resistors, (MODE_3/MODE_4) the output will be configured as an active low driver and conversely if the strapping input is pulled low (MODE_0/MODE_1), the output will be configured as active high. This LED circuit should be configured accordingly. |image2| Figure 2. LED_0 Hardware Configuration Pin Interaction
         
         **Link Status, LINK_ST**

         
         The ADIN1200 has a dedicated LINK_ST pin to provide information to the
         MAC on the status of the Link. By default, the LINK_ST pin goes high
         indicating the link is up and low to indicate the link is down. The
         LINK_ST polarity is programmable by setting the bit high
         GE_LNK_STAT_INV_EN. The LINK_ST could be used to drive an LED, however
         it resides in the VDDIO voltage domain, therefore, when driving an LED
         in an integrated RJ45 jack where the PHY VDDIO is 1.8V, level shifting
         will be required.

         **MAC Interface**

         
         The ADIN1200 supports MII, RMII and RGMII MAC interface modes, whereas
         the KSZ8081RNB supports RMII and the KSZ8081MNX supports MII interface.
         The following sections describe specifically the MII and RMII
         interfaces for both devices.
         
         **MII Interface**

         
         The MII interface is the communication path between the PHY and MAC
         devices. The KSZ8081MNX version will be covered here. The MII interface
         has a high pin count, with a total of 15 pins for data transmission,
         reception and to signal errors or collision. It is sometimes used in
         100M applications as it has a lower latency than RGMII and is much
         lower than RMII. Table 4 shows a pin overview of both devices for the
         MII MAC interface mode. When using the ADIN1200 in MII mode, the
         multifunction pin “LED_0/COL/TX_ER” automatically becomes COL.
         Similarly, the “INT_N/CRS” becomes CRS. The ADIN1200 sub-system
         registers provide user with ability to reconfigure which pin the COL
         and CRS functions are provided on (option of redirecting to GP_CLK,
         LINK_ST or INT_N). This requires a register write over MDIO interface
         to reconfigure.
         
         .. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/adin1300-and-adin1200/ksz8081_table_4_mii_mac_interface_mode_pin_comparison.png
         

   
   .. container:: half column

         
         **RMII Interface**

         
         The KSZ8081RNB model has RMII interface. RMII is a reduced MII
         interface using fewer pins as shown in Table 5. The pin count for this
         interface is 8 pins.

         
         |image3|

         RMII mode requires a 50MHz clock, REF_CLK. The KSZ8081RNB can generate
         a 50MHz clock internally and provide it to the MAC. Alternatively, it
         can accept an external 50MHz clock from the MAC. In RMII mode, the
         ADIN1200 requires an external 50MHz clock applied to XTAL_I.
         
         **RGMII Interface**

         
         The ADIN1200 supports an RGMII interface mode, while the KSZ8081 does
         not. The RGMII interface has a low pin count interface support for 10M,
         100M and Gigabit operation with a total of 12 pins for data
         transmission, reception and to signal errors or collisions. It is the
         most common interface used for Gigabit applications. The ADIN1200 can
         support 10/100 M speeds over the RGMII interface. Table 6 shows a pin
         overview of the ADIN1200 RGMII interface.

            :width: 600
         
         **Output Clocks**

         
         The ADIN1200 can optionally provide a number of clock signals on the
         GP_CLK pin. This is configured via MDIO writes and the clocks available
         are a 125 MHz free running clock, 25 MHz clock and 25MHz/125 MHz
         recovered clock.

         Hardware Configuration
         
         Both devices have a number of strapping options to enable managed or unmanaged configurations of the PHY function such as PHY address, mode of operation, Auto-Negotiation and MAC Interface. After power on, the strapping pin voltages get sensed and latched upon existing from a reset and the sensed voltages are used to set the personality of the PHY. When configuring any strapping configurations, ensure to review the default state of the MAC side, whether the pins are being driven when coming out of reset or if there are internal pulls. Understanding the behavior on the MAC side is key to ensuring there are no conflicts with the hardware strapping implemented, or to adjust the strapping resistor values if required. The KSZ8081 uses 2-level strapping options throughout, while the ADIN1200 uses a mix of 2-level and 4-level. In general, strapping pins are multi-functional and have different operation after the device is brought out of reset. The ADIN1200 has internal pull downs on many of its strapping pins (not all), therefore it would be possible to minimize external strapping resistors. |image4| Figure 3. ADIN1200 Hardware Strapping, 2 and 4 level strapping resistors

         
         |image5|

         Strapping configurations are very specific to the device, consult the
         respective datasheets to determine the exact configuration for required
         use case.
         
         **Hardware Configuration of Speed**

         
      For the ADIN1200, speed configuration is done using two pins, PHY_CFG0 and
      PHY_CFG1. These pins do not have any internal pull resistors, therefore
      external strapping is required. Both pins support 4-level strapping,
      providing much flexibility in terms of the possible combinations, such as
      Auto-neg speeds shown in Table 8 or Forced modes shown in Table 9. Review
      the datasheet hardware configuration pin section for full detail on the
      possible settings using these pins. The KSZ8081 uses pin SPEED to select
      between 10 or 100 M speeds and pin DUPLEX to configure HD or FD.

            :width: 600
         
         **Hardware Configuration of Auto-MDIX**

         
         Selection of Auto-MDIX for the ADIN1200 is done using one pin,
         (MDIX_MODE) with 4-level strapping. In the KSZ8081 Auto-MDI/MDI-X is
         enabled by default and can be disabled/configured with an MDIO write.

         
         |image7|

         **MAC Interface Selection**

         
         The ADIN1200 uses two hardware pins, MACIF_SEL0 and MACIF_SEL1 to
         provide user ability to select different MAC interfaces. These two pins
         have internal weak pull downs, therefore the default operation would be
         RGMII with delays as shown in Table 11. To configure any other MAC
         interface mode, use 10kΩ pull up or pull down resistors to select
         accordingly. The KSZ8081 MAC interface selection (RMII/MII) is chosen
         by selecting the appropriate part version (RNB/MNX).
         
         **Hardware Configuration of PHY Address**

         
         Both devices have a default strapping providing a PHY address of
         0x0000. The ADIN1200 provides four PHY address pins, allowing up to 16
         unique addresses possible. The PHY address pins are shared with the RXD
         output pins. The KSZ8081 provides three PHY address pins, capable of 8
         unique addresses. Two PHY Address pins are dedicated pins, with the
         third PHY address shared with an RXD output pin. Both devices use
         two-level strapping, either pull high or low to configure the PHY
         address.

   Strapping configurations are very specific to the device, consult the
   respective datasheets to determine the exact configuration for required use
   case.

         Package
         
         Both the ADIN1200 and the KSZ8081 are available in a 32 lead QFN/LFCSP
         package of 5 mm x 5mm body size. The devices have different pinouts,
         therefore the ADIN1200 is not a drop-in replacement for the Microchip
         product. This requires edits to the schematic and board layout to
         achieve this exchange.
         
         The underside of the LFCSP package for the ADIN1200 includes an exposed
         paddle which should be soldered directly to the board with an array of
         vias for thermal purposes. There are also two exposed stripes adjacent
         to the exposed paddle. These do not need to be soldered to the board,
         they should be treated as a keepout area as they are connected to
         supply rails in the device, therefore should not be tied to ground and
         there should be no routing or traces on the PCB layer directly
         underneath them.
         
         Other Pinout Considerations
         
         **Integrated MDI Termination**

         
         Both devices include integrated termination resistors on the MDI paths.
         These are voltage mode PHYs, no external resistors are required for
         biasing and no supply voltage is required at the center tap of the
         transformer.
         
         **RGMII**

         
      The ADIN1200 also supports RGMII MAC interface mode.

   
   .. container:: half column

         
         Software Considerations
         
         Both devices can be hardware strapped to be used in an unmanaged
         configuration. Alternatively, they can provide SMI/MII access over the
         MDIO interface. The KSZ8081 supports Clause 22 register access, while
         the ADIN1200 supports both Clause 22 and Clause 45 access. Registers
         0x0 to 0xF are common across all PHYs.
         
         **Linux Driver**

         
         The ADIN1200 has a Linux Driver available in the Linux mainline kernel. The ADIN1200 linux driver detail is captured here: :doc:`/wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/net-phy/adin`
         
         **Non Operating System Driver**

         
         The ADIN1200 has a Non Operating System Driver available from the devices product page here: :adi:`en/products/adin1200.html#product-requirement`

Example Configurations for RMII
-------------------------------

The following example captures how to configure the ADIN1200 for an unmanaged
configuration with RMII Interface, operating in Auto-negotiation mode
advertising all speeds. The PHY will power up in this state, ready to establish
a link with a link partner. The MAC interface configuration pins (MACIF_SEL0/1)
are pulled to VDDIO, setting the PHY to RMII mode. GP_CLK is set to MODE_3 to
configure an automatic MDIX operation. In addition, the PHY_CFG0 and PHY_CFG1
pins are configured for MODE_4 and MODE_1 respectively. The PHY_CFG0 pin is also
shared with the LED_0 pin, it’s configuration with MODE_4 means an active low
LED can be used on LED_0.

The following list summarizes an RMII auto negotiate, 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps full
duplex or half duplex:

-  MAC Interface = RMII

   -  MACIF_SEL0 = MODE_1 = 10 kΩ pull-up resistor
   -  MACIF_SEL1 = MODE_1 = 10 kΩ pull-up resistor

-  MDIX_MODE = automatic MDIX, preferred MDIX

   -  MDIX_MODE = MODE_3

-  PHY address = 0b0001
-  Speed selection = 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps with full duplex or half duplex,
   auto-negotiation enabled

   -  PHY_CFG0 = MODE_4 = 10 kΩ pull-up resistor

::

     *PHY_CFG1 = MODE_1 = 10 kΩ pull-down resistor
