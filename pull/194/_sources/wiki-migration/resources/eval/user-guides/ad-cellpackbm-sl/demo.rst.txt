Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Battery Pack Assembly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: indent

   In this demo, 39 batteries will be assembled to create a 48V battery pack.

   
   -  **Determine the Number of Batteries**
   
      -  The number of cells in series **N** can be calculated by dividing the **total voltage needed** (48V) by the **voltage of one cell** (3.7V).
   
         -  In this example, 13 cells are required to build a 48V battery pack. Each cell consists of 3 batteries connected in parallel, resulting in a total of 39 batteries for the entire pack.
         -  Arrange the batteries according to the picture below.
   
   .. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-bmse2e3w-sl/battery_arrangement.png
      :align: center
      :width: 2000px
   
   -  **Connecting the Batteries**

      :align: center
      :width: 2000px
   
   ::
   
        * Make a Parallel Connection. Connect 3 batteries in parallel by linking all positive terminals and all negative terminals using the lithium-ion battery nickel strip. Use a spot welder, ensuring a strong and reliable connection. Repeat this process to form 13 cells.
          * After completing the 13 cells, make a Series Connection by connecting the positive terminal of one cell to the negative terminal of the next cell. Continue this process until all 13 cells are connected in series.
      Adding Cell Terminal Strips
        * Cut and prepare the appropriate lengths of nickel strips to be used as terminal connections.
          * Attach a nickel strip based on the picture below. Use a spot welder or suitable method to securely weld the strip to the terminal.
          * Solder a single wire cable on each nickel strip terminal except for Vbat+ and Vbat-.

      :width: 2000px
   
   -  Insulation and Final Assembly
   
      -  Ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated to prevent short circuits.
   
         -  Use heat shrink tubing or electrical tape to cover exposed connections.
         -  Place the battery pack in a suitable enclosure for protection and ease of handling.

   .. warning::

      Refer to the diagram above and make sure to connect the bottom part of the pack.

         
      Important: Before connecting lithium-ion cells in parallel, ensure that all cells have the same or very close voltage levels (within ±0.05V). Connecting cells with different charge levels can result in large inrush currents, potentially causing: sparks or overheating, permanent cell damage, fire or thermal runaway, reduced battery life.

   


Connection Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Set the P14 jumper of the SDP-K1 to the 3.3 V position.

Running the Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: indent

   
   -  Follow the instructions provided above to set up the hardware components. Ensure all connections are secure and aligned with the diagram and specifications.
   -  Open the **BMS Browser GUI** either by searching for it in the Start Menu or using the shortcut on the Desktop.
   -  Upon launching, a console window will appear to display background information.
   -  Two new tabs will open in the default browser on the PC, with the User Guide tab as the default.
   -  Switch to the alternative tab to access the BMS Browser configuration page, which should be displayed.
   -  Ensure that the SDP-K1 is connected to the PC via the USB-C cable on P10. The **Blue LED**, **D31** will illuminate when powered.
   -  Go to the **Interface Connection** section and select the COM port associated with the SDP-K1.
   -  Under the **Daisy Chain** section, ensure the *Generation* drop-down box is set to **ADBMSGEN6**.
   -  From the **Products** list, select the **ADBMS2950**, then click on the right arrow to add it to the Daisy Chain. Then select the **ADBMS6830** and add it as well in the daisy chain. **Settings** can remain as default.
   -  Click Launch.
   
   .. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-cellpackbm-sl/browser_launch.png
      :align: center
      :width: 2000px
   
   -  Upon launching, the Quick Measure tab will open. Note: this utility only supports a single BMS product in a Daisy Chain. Click Start Quick Measure to begin measurements.
   
   .. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-cellpackbm-sl/start-quick-measure.png
      :align: center
      :width: 2000px
   
   -  Check the Total PEC Status under the Memory Map. This indicates the status of the isoSPI link between the EVAL-ADBMS6822 and the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW and EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC.
   
      -  Verify the connection of the twisted cable between the EVAL-ADBMS6822 and the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW.
      -  Ensure that the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW and EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC are powered up properly.
   
   -  Check the cell voltage readings. Monitor the voltage channels on the Quick Measure Utility graph. Select which signals to display on the graph under the **Plot All Devices** column.

      :align: center
      :width: 2000px
   
   .. note::

      For Step 9: If cell voltage measurement is the focus of the demo, place ADBMS6830 as the second device in the daisy chain—both in hardware wiring and software configuration. If battery pack current and voltage monitoring is the priority, place ADBMS2950 as the second device in the daisy chain. This is important because the BMS Browser GUI primarily recognizes and interacts with the second device in the daisy chain during operation

   


Results and Discussion

Quick Measure Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: indent

   The Quick Measure tab simplifies metric measurement with a preloaded command sequence. Note that it supports a single device in the daisy chain, and key features enhance configuration and visualization.

   .. container:: centeralign

      **Battery Pack Current Monitoring**

   
   Using a 50 μΩ shunt resistor, the total battery pack current can be calculated by dividing the I1ADC voltage by the shunt resistance. For instance, with an I1ADC voltage of 0.000088 V, the current is determined as:
   
   .. math::
   
   
      Battery Pack Current = (I1) / (50 × 10^{-6}Ω)
   
   .. math::
   
   
      Battery Pack Current = (0.000088 V) / (50 × 10^{-6}Ω)
   
   .. math::
   
   
      Battery Pack Current = 1.76 A
   
   This calculation provides the actual current flowing through the battery pack based on the measured voltage across the shunt resistor.

   
   |image3|

   .. container:: centeralign

      Battery Pack Voltage Monitoring

   
   ADBMS2950B features two dedicated battery-stack voltage measurements path that connect to one or two external resistor dividers via the VBAT1 and VBAT2. In this example, the battery-stack voltage is determined as:
   
   .. math::
   
   
      Battery-Stack Voltage = (VB1 / 9.1 Ω) (9.1 Ω + 3 \times 1200 Ω)
   
   .. math::
   
   
      Battery-Stack Voltage = \frac{0.088300 V}{ {9.1 Ω}} (9.1 Ω + 3 \times 1200 Ω)
   
   .. math::
   
   
      Battery-Stack Voltage = 35.02 V
   
   The voltage at these pins is first buffered to provide a high input resistance and then applied to two 16-bit ADCs.
