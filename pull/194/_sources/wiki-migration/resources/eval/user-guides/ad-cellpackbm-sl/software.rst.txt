Custom GUI Configuration
------------------------

The configuration settings in the GUI's config.json file allow users to tailor
the software to their specific needs, providing a more customized and efficient
experience.

This section explores the three key settings: auto_detect_sdp,
limit_usb_polling, and display_user_manual_on_start - that users can adjust to
better align the software to their intended applications.

Key Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

auto_detect_sdp:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Purpose:** Determines whether the software automatically connects to all comports or requires manual selection of the NUCLEO comport.
-  **Default Setting:** true
-  **Modification:**

   -  Open the config.json file located in the base directory of the software.
   -  Locate the "auto_detect_sdp" setting and change its value to false.
   -  Save the changes.

limit_usb_polling:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Purpose:** Controls the poll rate of the NUCLEO comport, balancing CPU usage and sample rate.
-  **Default Setting:** false
-  **Modification:**

   -  Open the config.json file.
   -  Find the "limit_usb_polling" setting and change its value to true if a reduced poll rate is preferred.
   -  Save the changes.

display_user_manual_on_start:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Purpose:** Governs whether the user manual is displayed each time the software starts.
-  **Default Setting:** true
-  **Modification:**

   -  Open the config.json file.
   -  Locate the "display_user_manual_on_start" setting and change its value to false if you prefer not to see the manual on startup.
   -  Save the changes.

.. tip::

   By adjusting these configuration settings in the config.json file, users can
   optimize the software's behavior to better suit their requirements. Whether
   it's fine-tuning comport connections, managing CPU usage, or controlling the
   display of the user manual, these settings provide a flexible approach to
   enhancing the software's usability. Make sure to save your changes and
   restart the software for the modifications to take effect.
