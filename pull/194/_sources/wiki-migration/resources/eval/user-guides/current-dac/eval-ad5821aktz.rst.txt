To connect the on-board VCM load, links should connect positions of JP3 and JP4 as indicated in Table 1.

Link positions are outlined in Table 1. Default positions are in bold.

Table 1: EVAL-AD5821A-DBZ Link Positions and Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

==== ======== ======================
Link Position Description
==== ======== ======================
JP1  **ON**   Internal
JP2  OFF      External
                 
JP3  **ON**   Internal VCM load
JP4  OFF      External VCM load
                 
P8   **1-2**  Load supplied by AVDD1
     3-4      Load supplied by AVDD2
                 
==== ======== ======================

P2 connector can be used to connect and external I2C host. To do that disconnect the links on JP1 and JP2.

JP3 and JP4 connectors allow the access to the typical VCM resistances and inductances. When the links are connected to the typical VCM resistances and inductances, the user also has access to test the ±VCM pins (TP1 and TP2) and the middle point between the resistor and the inductor (TP3).

To use an external VCM load, disconnect the links on JP3 and JP4 and connect the external load to P5.

EVAL-APOLLO-LD-MBZ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This board has been designed to connect different daughterboards that support different products. It also features a connector to the Apollo microcontroller board.

The EVAL-APOLLO-LD-MBZ also contains LDOs to generate the required voltages for AD5821A and other ICs like level shifters, current sense amplifiers and one ADC, who provides support to measure the AVDD1/AVDD2 supply voltages and currents.

By using different configuration of links, the user can select either AVDD1 or AVDD2 supply to power the AD5821A and is also possible to configure the supplies as fixed or adjustable. DVDD is the IO voltage for I2C level of AD5821A and can also be configured via links.

A more detailed explanation of AVDD1/AVDD2 and DVDD configuration is given in the *Software/Plugins/Hardware Setup* section of this document.

Table 2 shows the default link positions (default positions are in bold) and Figure 3 shows the default links position in green as well as the board connectors and test points.

PLUGINS
~~~~~~~

REGISTER MAP
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plugin provides access to all the registers and register fields of the part. For the AD5821A there is only one register, the input register, so it is recommended to control the device using the AF Driver plugin that will be explained later.

Clicking on *RegMap1* in *Register Map Tree* the whole register map is inserted in the main subpanel as shown in Figure 8. The information shown is updated from the device and the user can expand/contract a specific register to update it and show the fields inside. When the value or enumeration column is modified, the new configuration is written to the device.

HARDWARE SETUP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Hardware Setup plugin helps the user to configure AVDD1, AVDD2 and DVDD supplies and three GPIOs, as well as selecting the appropriate links for a given configuration.

An image of the EVAL-APOLLO -LD_MBZ silkscreen is shown in the panel to the right (Figure 9), showing the default link positions highlighted in green. When changing the options on the left panel, the link positions also change in the board image. The user must ensure that the positions of the jumpers in the silkscreen image match the current positions of the links in the board when any of the options is changed. After moving the jumper to the indicated position click OK next to the warning message that appears on the bottom of the panel.

   *\*\* Figure 9. Hardware Setup plugin \*\**


AVDD1 and AVDD2
"""""""""""""""

The configuration options for AVDD1 and AVDD2 are the same. The difference between these two supplies is that AVDD1 powers the AD5821A and the VCM load and the AVDD2 powers only the load. The two supplies are mutually exclusive. The VDD pin of AD5821A (see Daughterboard Schematic under Documents menu) is always connected to AVDD1.

The first option is to choose AVDD1/AVDD2 Internal (default) or External. In case external supply is selected, the user must connect the power supply cable to P9 (AVDD1) or P22 (AVDD2). The positive is pin 1 and ground is pin 2.

There are three possibilities under Internal Supply Options (only when Internal supply is selected):

-  *Adjustable 2.7 V – 4.8 V* (default): Uses a LDO that can be adjusted by software. An external supply is required for voltages higher than 4.8 V.
-  *3.3 V fixed*: 3.3 V from a fixed LDO
-  *5 V fixed*: 5 V from USB

When *Adjustable 2.7 V – 4.8 V* is selected, the control boxes under *AVDD1/AVDD2* can be used to set the desired voltage. A voltage monitor box is positioned to the right side of the correspondent control box. The voltage measurements are provided by an on-board ADC. When *IAVDD1/IAVDD2* checkbox is set, the current from AVDD1 and AVDD2 supplies are also measured.

GPIOs
"""""

There are three possible sources for the GPIOs:

-  *Software* (default): The software controls the GPIO level
-  *DVDD*: GPIO is at level high, voltage equal to DVDD
-  *GND*: GPIO is at level low, voltage equal to 0 V

GPIO1 is connected to AD5821A’s XSHUTDOWN pin. Setting the Level to low puts the AD5821A in power-down mode. Setting the Level to high (default) puts the part in operating mode again.

GPIO2 and GPIO3 are not connected in this evaluation board so their settings have no effect on the AD5821A.

DVDD
""""

The DVDD is the digital IO for the I2C level of AD5821A.

-  *1.8 V* (default): Internal LDO
-  *3.3 V*: Internal LDO
-  *EXT*: External. In this case the level is internally limited to 3.3 V

AF DRIVER
"""""""""

Figure 10 shows the *AF Driver* plugin. This plugin is used to control the power-down function and the sink current of the AD5821A in an easy manner. It controls the AD5821A *XSHUTDOWN* software function (bit 15 of input register) and the AF code data D0..D9 (bits 4 to 13 of input register) to set the desired sink current.

At start up the AD5821A is in power-down mode. The button in *Auto Focus Drive Control* shows the text POWER UP. By clicking on the button, the AD5821A goes to operating mode and the button text toggles to POWER DOWN. By clicking again, the part returns to power-down. The button works in an alternate function between POWER UP and POWER DOWN.

Once in operating mode, the current sink by the AD5821A can be controlled in one of three ways:

-  Moving the slider
-  Typing the current value in the *Current* box (in mA)
-  Typing the *DAC Code* in the corresponding box (See Ad5821A datasheet for information about the DAC code)

Below the current control section is the Input Register. Its value automatically updates when the user changes the current level or click on *POWER UP/POWER DOWN* button. Although the user can read/write the input register, it is preferable to control the AD5821A using the functions explained before. The *Input Register* is not necessary to control the part; it is shown for informative purposes only.

AF DRIVER SWEEP
"""""""""""""""

This plugin is used to sweep the AD5821A current between a minimum current and maximum current, at time intervals defined at *Time Step* control box (time intervals below 10 ms are not accurate).

The value of the current is updated in the slider and monitor boxes to the right of the min/max current setting boxes, as shown in Figure 11.

Click on *Start Sweep* button to start the sweep, Stop Sweep button to stop it and the Reset button to bring the AF Driver current to 0 mA.
