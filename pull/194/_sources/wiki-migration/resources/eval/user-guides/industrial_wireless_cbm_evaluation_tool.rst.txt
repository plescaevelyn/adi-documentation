Wireless Vibration Monitoring Platform
======================================

Overview
--------

This document details the function and setup of an Analog Devices wireless
Condition Based Monitoring (CBM) evaluation platform. The platform provides a
wireless signal chain for MEMS-accelerometer based vibration monitoring.
Visualisation of this data for up to three motes (device package containing
accelerometer, microcontroller and RF board) is available through a PC-based
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The CBM hardware signal chain consists of a single-axis ADXL1002 accelerometer
mounted to the base of the module. The output of the ADXL1002 is read into the
ADuCM4050 low power microcontroller where it is buffered, transformed to
frequency domain and streamed to the SmartMESH IP mote. From the SmartMESH chip
it is wirelessly streamed to the SmartMESH IP Manager. The manager connects to a
PC and visualization and saving of the data can take place.

Getting Started
---------------

Equipment
~~~~~~~~~

The following hardware is required to use the evaluation tool.

-  :adi:`SmartMesh IP Manager (DC2274A) <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/dc2274a-a.html#eb-overview>`

::

   *CBM Hardware Module (referred to as “Mote”)

The software required to see the data collected can be accessed by direct
download from this wiki. See "Software Installation"

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Plug the manager into any available USB port on your PC
-  Insert a battery into at least one mote.
-  Download the available software below in the software installation section.
-  Save the CBM_app executable anywhere on your PC and launch the program.
-  A window should pop up, prompting you for the COM port of your manager. Search for the manager port number in your computers device manager, under PORTS(COM & LPT). The correct COM port is the *last of four consecutive COM ports*.
-  Click connect.
-  When the Mote's green LED starts blinking, data is plotted, with the default being time and fft plots.
-  While the mote is stationary, double click the remove adc offset checkbox

Guides
~~~~~~

A setup guide has been created for the Wireless CBM tool which is available on
this wiki. This may be used if the quickstart provided here does not result in
successful operation of the program, or for more information about this program
and its setup.

In addition, a firmware guide with greater detail on the inner workings of the
program can be downloaded here.

Typical Measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the program running, with a mote connected, simply shaking the mote
in the direction of the axis (indicated on the mote by a small notch near the
base) should update the plots with some meaningful vibration data.

This demo can be improved by using the mote in conjunction with a small
motorized device (e.g. electric fan). Simply place the mote as close to the
vibration source as possible and observe the results in the GUI.

Below is a typical example of DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) data for an
unbalanced motor rotating at 2000 RPM. Additionally provided is an explanation
of where motor and bearing information should appear through the use of DFT.
