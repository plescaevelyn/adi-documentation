:adi:`ADP505x DEMO GUI software <media/en/evaluation-boards-kits/evaluation-software/adp505x_demogui_installer_ver-cg_wv2_00.zip>`

General Description
-------------------

This user guide describes the hardware and software for the evaluation of the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053`, including detailed schematics and printed circuit board (PCB) layouts.

The :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation board combines four high performance buck regulators and supervisory in a 48-lead LFCSP package to meet demanding performance and board space requirements. The :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation board can connect to high input voltages, up to 15 V directly, without any preregulators.

The :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` share a common PCB evaluation board; however, whereas the :adi:`ADP5051` board can support an external USB dongle connection and GUI software to evaluate the comprehensive functionalities provided by an I\ :sup:`2`\ C interface, the :adi:`ADP5053` has no I\ :sup:`2`\ C interface capability. Both the :adi:`ADP5051` and the :adi:`ADP5053` operate in the same manner and are available in an adjustable voltage option.

Full details on the devices are provided in the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` data sheet available from Analog Devices, Inc., and should be consulted in conjunction with this evaluation board user guide.

USING THE EVALUATION BOARD
==========================

POWERING UP THE EVALUATION BOARD
--------------------------------

The :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation board is supplied fully assembled and tested. Before applying power to the evaluation board, follow the procedures in this section.

Enable Jumpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each channel has its own enable pin, which must be pulled high to enable that channel (see Table 1). To disable the channel, pull the enable pin low or leave it floating.

The enable control for each regulator has a 0.8 V precision enable threshold, which allows the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` to be easily sequenced between channels or other input/output supplies. It can also be used as a programmable UVLO input by the resistor divider.

When the external hardware enable pin is high, the CHx_ON enable register setting in the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software can be used to power down each channel operation.

**Table 1. Channels of the Enable Pins**

========= === ============== ======================
Channel   Pin Enable Jumpers Description
========= === ============== ======================
CH1: Buck EN1 J-EN1          0.8 V precision enable
CH2: Buck EN2 J-EN2          0.8 V precision enable
CH3: Buck EN3 J-EN3          0.8 V precision enable
CH4: Buck EN4 J-EN4          0.8 V precision enable
========= === ============== ======================

Power Input Jumpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each channel has its own power input jumper, which enables support for either a separate input voltage or cascaded options for all channels.

The power input for the buck regulators is 4.5 V to 15 V. Shunt S1, S2, and S3 to allow for easy setup by using all of the same input voltages for the buck regulators.

The power supply for the VDDIO pin in the I\ :sup:`2`\ C interface block is 1.7 V to 3.6 V; shunt LK7 to use VDD (3.0 V) as the VDDIO supply. See Table 2 for the power input details.

**Table 2. Channels of Power Input Pins**

========= ===== ============ ==============
Channel   Pin   Input Jumper Input Range
========= ===== ============ ==============
CH1: Buck PVIN1 J11          4.5 V to 15 V
CH2: Buck PVIN2 S1           4.5 V to 15 V
CH3: Buck PVIN3 S2           4.5 V to 15 V
CH4: Buck PVIN4 S3           4.5 V to 15 V
VDDIO     VDDIO LK7          1.7 V to 3.6 V
========= ===== ============ ==============

Jumper J-SYNC (SYNC/MODE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Jumper J-SYNC, as shown in Figure 1, connects the SYNC/MODE pin of the device to either low or high. Shunt the center contact of the J-SYNC jumper (SYNC/MODE) to the left pin header to pull the SYNC/MODE pin high to VREG (5 V) to allow the buck regulators into forced PWM operation. In this setting, use the PSMx_ON register setting in the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software to configure individual PSM/FPWM operation for each buck.

Shunt the center contact of the J-SYNC jumper to the right pin header to pull the MODE pin low, which forces the buck regulators to operate in automatic PWM/PSM operation. The PSMx_ON setting in the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software is ignored.

Input Power Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before connecting the power source to the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation boards, ensure that the evaluation board is turned off. If the input power source includes a current meter, use that meter to monitor the input current. Connect the positive terminal of the power source to the PVIN1_4 terminal (J11) on the evaluation board, and connect the negative terminal of the power source to the GND terminal (J12) of the board.

If the power source does not include a current meter, connect a current meter in series with the input source voltage. Connect the positive terminal of the power source to the positive lead (+) of the current meter, connect the negative terminal of the power source to the GND terminal (J12) on the evaluation board, and the connect the negative lead (−) of the current meter to the PVIN1_4 terminal (J11) on the board.

Output Load
~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that the board is turned off before connecting the load.

Connect an electronic load or resistor to set the load current. If the load includes an ammeter, or if the current is not measured, connect the load directly to the evaluation board, with the positive (+) load connected to one of the channels. For example, connect Buck 1, J16 (VOUT1), and the negative (−) load connection to J15 (GND).

If an ammeter is used, connect it in series with the load. Connect the positive (+) ammeter terminal to the evaluation board for Buck 1, J16 (VOUT1), connect the negative (−) ammeter terminal to the positive (+) load terminal, and connect the negative (−) load terminal to the evaluation board at J15 (GND).

Input and Output Voltmeters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Measure the input and output voltages with voltmeters. Ensure that the voltmeters are connected to the appropriate evaluation board terminals and not to the load or power sources themselves.

If the voltmeters are not connected directly to the evaluation board, the measured voltages are incorrect due to the voltage drop across the leads and/or connections between the evaluation board, the power source, and/or the load.

Connect the input voltage measuring voltmeter positive terminal (+) to the evaluation board at J11 (PVIN1_4) and connect the input voltage measuring voltmeter negative (−) terminal to the evaluation board at J12(GND). Connect the output voltage measuring voltmeter positive (+) terminal to the evaluation board at J16 (VOUT1) for measuring the output voltage of Buck 1, and connect the output voltage measuring voltmeter negative (−) terminal to the evaluation board at J15 (GND).

Quick Start
-----------

Ensure that the software and USB driver are installed as described in the Installing the Software section. Ensure that

::

   *The power source voltage for the buck regulators (PVIN1, PVIN2, PVIN3, PVIN4) is 4.5 V to 15 V. Shunt the S1, S2, and S3 jumpers to use all of the same input voltages for the buck regulators.
   *Optional for I<sup>2</sup>C interface evaluation: shunt LK7 to use VDD as the VDDIO supply, and connect the USB dongle to the I<sup>2</sup>C head jumper in the board.
   *Input the WDI toggle signal, which is required as an evaluation WDI feature.
   *Use the J-EN1, J-EN2, J-EN3, and J-EN4 jumpers to enable or disable the desirable channel.

Figure 10 shows the :adi:`ADP5051` board connection diagram. The :adi:`ADP5053` works in a similar manner, but does not have a USB dongle connection.


|image9|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 10. ADP5051 Board Connection Diagram (USB Dongle is Optional)*\


When the power source and load are connected to the evaluation board, the board can be powered for operation. If the load is not enabled, enable the load. Verify that it is drawing the proper current and that the output voltage maintains voltage regulation. After the power-up, the following output voltage can be measured:

::

   *V<sub>OUT1</sub> = 1.2 V, supply up to a 4 A output load
   *V<sub>OUT2</sub> = 3.3 V, supply up to a 4 A output load
   *V<sub>OUT3</sub> = 1.8 V, supply up to a 1.2 A output load
   *V<sub>OUT4</sub> = 5.0 V, supply up to a 1.2 A output load
   *V<sub>REG</sub> = 5.0 V, supply up to a 50 mA output load

ADP5051 GUI SOFTWARE
====================

To run the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI, click **Start** > **All Programs** > **Analog Devices ADP505x** > **ADP505x DEMO GUI-cg**. If the program starts correctly and the board is detected, the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI appears, as shown in Figure 11. The program default settings are as follows:



- Choose the correct device I<sup>2</sup>C address. Select **WDI Ver 0x4A** for the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053`.
- All registers are initialized to default values.
- Check the I<sup>2</sup>C status.

MEASURING EVALUATION BOARD PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------

Measuring Output Voltage Ripple of the Buck Regulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To observe the output voltage ripple of Buck 1, place an oscilloscope probe across the output capacitor (COUT_1) with the probe ground lead at the negative (−) capacitor terminal and the probe tip at the positive (+) capacitor terminal. Figure 12 shows the typical output ripple waveform.


|image10|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 12. Output Ripple, V\ IN = 12 V, V\ OUT = 1.2 V, L = 1 μH,

   C\ OUT = 47 μF × 2, f\ SW = 700 kHz, FPWM Mode*\


Set the oscilloscope to ac, 10 mV/division, and 2 µs/division time base, with the bandwidth set to 20 MHz to avoid noise interference with the measurements. To minimize coupling, shorten the ground loop of the oscilloscope probe.

To effectively measure the output voltage ripple, solder a wire to the negative (−) capacitor terminal and wrap it around the barrel of the probe and connect the tip directly to the positive (+) capacitor terminal, as shown in Figure 13.


|image11|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 13. Measuring Output Voltage Ripple*\


Measuring the Switching Waveform of Buck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To observe the switching waveform with an oscilloscope, place the oscilloscope probe tip at the end of the inductor with the probe ground at GND. Set the oscilloscope to dc, 5 V/division, and 1 µs/division time base.

When the SYNC/MODE pin is set to high, the buck regulators operate in forced PWM mode and the PSMx_ON registers in the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software can be used to configure individual PSM/FPWM operation for each buck. Typical PWM and PSM switching waveforms are shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15.

When the MODE pin is set to low, the buck regulators operate in power save mode (PSM), improving the light load efficiency.


|image12|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 14. Typical PSM Mode Waveform, V\ IN = 12 V, V\ OUT = 3.3 V, I\ OUT = 3 A, f\ SW = 600 kHz, L = 4.7 μH, C\ OUT = 47 µF × 2, FPWM Mode*\

   f\ SW = 600 kHz, L = 4.7 μH, C\ OUT = 47 µF × 2, FPWM Mode*\


Measuring the Synchronization Input or Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure the SYNC/MODE pin as the clock output,set the SYNC_OUT bit in :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software (or by factory fuse). A clock is generated at the SYNC/MODE pin with the frequency equal to the internal frequency set by the RT pin.

When the SYNC/MODE pin is configured as the input, the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` can be synchronized to an external clock applied to the SYNC/MODE pin. Note that the internal clock set by the RT pin must be programmed close to the external clock.

Measuring Load Regulation of the Buck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test the load regulation by increasing the load at the output and looking at the change in output voltage. The input voltage must be held constant during this measurement. To minimize voltage drop, use short low resistance wires, especially for loads approaching maximum current. Typical buck load regulation is shown in Figure 16.


|image14|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 16. Buck Load Regulation*\


Measuring Line Regulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To measure line regulation, vary the input voltage and examine the change in the output voltage. Typical buck line regulation is shown in Figure 17.


|image15|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 17. Buck Line Regulation*\


Measuring Efficiency of the Buck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Measure the efficiency, η, by comparing the input power with the output power.

:math:`\displaystyle η = \frac{V_{OUT} × I_{OUT}}{V_{IN} × I_{IN}}`

To reduce the effect of IR drops, measure the input and output voltages as near as possible to the input and output capacitors.

Measuring Inductor Current
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Measure the inductor current by removing one end of the inductor from its pad and connecting a current loop in series. A current probe can be connected to this wire.

Modifying the Board
-------------------

Setting the Output Voltage of the Bucks (CH1 to CH4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The buck output voltage is set through external resistor dividers, shown in Figure 19 for Buck 1. Optionally, the output voltage can be factory programmed to default values, as indicated in the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` data sheet. FB1 must be connected to the top of the capacitor on VOUT1 by placing a 0 Ω resistor on R\ :sub:`TOP`. In an output adjustable version, the equation for the output voltage setting is

:math:`V_{OUT} = V_{REF} × (1 + R_{TOP}/R_{BOT})`

The V\ :sub:`REF` voltage (FB1, FB2, FB3, FB4) for the buck regulators is 0.800 V in the adjustable version.


|image17|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 19. Buck 1 External Output Voltage Setting*\


When the output voltage of the bucks are changed, the values of inductors, output capacitors, and compensation networks might, likewise, need to be recalculated and changed for stable operation. See the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` data sheet for more details on external components selection.

Setting the POR Threshold Voltage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The monitoring voltage can be set through external resistor dividers, as well (see Figure 20). The equation for the monitoring voltage is

:math:`V_{OUTx} = V_{VTH} × (1 + R_{TOP}/R_{BOT})`

The voltage of VTH is 0.500 V.


|image18|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 20. Monitoring Voltage Threshold Setting*\


External Resistor Divider Setting for Bucks and POR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation boards are supplied with the resistor divider for a target output voltage. Varying the resistor values of the resistor divider networks varies the output voltage accordingly. Table 3 shows the external resistor divider for each channel.

**Table 3. External Resistor Dividers in Each Channel**

Changing the Switching Frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The switching frequency of the\ :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` on the evaluation board is programmed at 650 kHz. To change the switching frequency, replace the R3 resistor at the RT pin with a different value, as shown in Figure 21.


|image19|

.. container:: centeralign

   \ *Figure 21. Switching Frequency vs. RT Resistor*\


There is a frequency-halved bit (FREQ1 and FREQ3 in Register 7) for Channel 1 and Channel 3, respectively. Each bit can be used to program its switching frequency to be half that of the master switching frequency, which is set by the RT pin.

When the switching frequency is changed, the values of inductors, the output capacitors, and the compensation networks must, likewise, be recalculated and changed for stable operation. Refer to the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` data sheet for more details on external components selection.

Changing the Peak Current-Limit Threshold in Channel 1/Channel 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The peak current limit of the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation board in Channel 1 and Channel 2 is set to 6.4 A. To change the peak current limit threshold, replace the R8 resistor for Channel 1 (R7 for Channel 2) with a different value, as shown in Table 5. The programmable current-limit threshold feature allows for the use of a small size inductor for low current applications.

**Table 5. Load Capability Setting on Channel 1**

+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

Changing the Soft Start Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The soft start time of the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` on the evaluation board is programmed at 2 ms for the four buck regulators. To change the soft start time, replace the R39 and R16 resistors for Channel 1 and Channel 2 (R40 and R18 for Channel 3 and Channel 4) with a different value, as shown in Table 6 (note that N/A means not applicable).

Changing Channel 1/Channel 2 to a 2-Phase Parallel Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel 1 and Channel 2 are programmed as individual outputs on the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation boards. To configure Channel 1/Channel 2 as a 2-phase parallel output operation, the following steps are required:

::

   -Short the jumper, S4.
   -Change R39 = 100 kΩ and R16 = 600 kΩ (or R39 = 600 kΩ and R16 = 100 kΩ) in the SS12 pin setting.
   -Remove R17 and C8 from the COMP2 pin.
   -Remove R4, and replace R29 with 0 Ω on the FB2 pin.
   -Shunt the J-EN2 jumper to low.
   -Use the FB1 pin (R2 and R28) to set the output voltage.
   -Use J-EN1 (EN1 pin) to enable or disable the regulator.

During the parallel configuration, the input voltage and the current-limit threshold for both channels should be the same, and FPWM mode operation on both Channel 1 and Channel 2 are recommended. See the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` data sheet for details regarding 2-phase parallel output.

Changing the Phase Shift (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) in the Buck Regulators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation board, the phase shift is 180° between Channel 1 and Channel 2, and 180° between Channel 3 and Channel 4. Channel 1 and Channel 3 operate in 0° phase shift.

With the :adi:`ADP5050` only, the phase shift can be programmed at 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270° from Channel 2 to Channel 4 with reference to Channel 1 via PHASE2, PHASE3, and PHASE4 in the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software. See the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` data sheet for details regarding 2-phase parallel output.

Changing the Power-Good (PWRGD) Output Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the :adi:`ADP5051`/:adi:`ADP5053` evaluation board, the PWRGD output becomes active high when the selective regulator is under normal operation. The PWRGD hardware output is logically AND'ed of an internal unmasked PWRGD signal.

With the :adi:`ADP5051` only, each immediate PWRGD signal in each buck can be read back by the PWRGDx bit in the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software. The only desirable channels from Channel 1 to Channel 4 can be configured by factory fuse or I\ :sup:`2`\ C interface. Use the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software to configure MASK_CHx in Register 0x08 to obtain a desirable PWRGD output signal.

Changing the Interrupt Output Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the :adi:`ADP5051` only, use the :math:`overlineINT` pin for the fault condition warning. During normal operation, the interrupt output is pulled high. When any fault occurs, the :adi:`ADP5050` pulls the :math:`overlineINT` pin low to raise the fault warning to the I\ :sup:`2`\ C host. There are six interrupt sources available in the :adi:`ADP5051`, as shown in Table 6.

+===========+=====================================================================================+
| PWRG1_INT | Power-good failure detected on Channel 1                                            |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PWRG2_INT | Power-good failure detected on Channel 2                                            |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PWRG3_INT | Power-good failure detected on Channel 3                                            |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PWRG4_INT | Power-good failure detected on Channel 4                                            |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| LVIN_INT  | PVIN1 voltage drops below the specified threshold (adjustable in Register 7)        |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TEMP_INT  | Junction temperature rises above the specified threshold (adjustable in Register 7) |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| MR_INT    | The :math:`overlineMR` button has been pressed                                      |
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The interrupt (if any) that appears on the :math:`overlineINT` pin is determined by the mask bits mapped in Register INT_MASK. To clear an interrupt, write 1b to the detected bit in INT_STATUS, or reset the device using UVLO.

Reading the interrupt or writing a 0b has no effect.

Enabling the Overheat Detection (ADP5051 Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the thermal shutdown protection, the :adi:`ADP5051` has another overheat warning function, which compares the junction temperature against the specified overheat threshold: 105°C, 115°C, or 125°(adjustable in Register 8, TEMP_TH).

Unlike thermal shutdown, the overheat warning function only sends out a warning signal without any shutdown. When the junction temperature rises above the threshold, the status bit, TEMP_INT, goes high. To clear the TEMP_INT status bit, write 1b to the status bit. The TEMP_INT bit status is latched until the bit is cleared.

Use the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software to set the TEMP_TH register to enable the overheat feature. Configure TEMP_INT to source this overheat fault into the :math:`overlineINT` pin.

Enabling the Low Input Voltage Detection (ADP5051 Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the undervoltage lockout (UVLO), the :adi:`ADP5051` includes a low input voltage detection circuit (to monitor PVIN1 only) that compares the input voltage against the specified voltage threshold, which is adjustable from 4.2 V to 11.2 V with 0.5 V steps in Register 8, TH_CFG.

Unlike the UVLO shutdown, the low input voltage warning function only sends out a warning signal without any shutdown. When the input voltage drops below the threshold, the status bit, LVIN_INT, goes high. To clear the LVIN_INT status bit, write 1b to the status bit. The LVIN_INT bit status is latched until the bit is cleared.

Use the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software to set the LVIN_TH bit to enable the low input voltage detection feature. Configure LVIN_INT to source the low input fault into the nINT pin.

Enabling the Dynamic Voltage Scaling (ADP5051 Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`ADP5051` provides a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) function for Channel 1 and Channel 4, and those outputs can be real-time settings via I\ :sup:`2`\ C interface. Because only fixed output options support the DVS function, FB1 and FB4 must be connected to the output by placing a 0 Ω resistor on R\ :sub:`TOP`.

Use the :adi:`ADP5051` GUI software to set DVSx-INTVAL and enable DVSx-ON in Register 0x05. Then, change the different VID options in the CHx VOUTx register to obtain a real-time output voltage step up or step down.

.. tip::

   Note that to avoid rapid output voltage changes to the next target value that result in abnormal problems, such as PWRGD failure, OVP latch-off, or hiccup, enable the DVS function prior to setting VID.
