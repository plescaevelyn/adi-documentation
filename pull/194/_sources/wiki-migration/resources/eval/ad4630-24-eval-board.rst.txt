General Description
-------------------

The EVAL-AD4630-24FMCZ, EVAL-AD4030-24FMCZ & EVAL-AD4630-16FMCZ evaluation boards enable quick and easy evaluation of the AD4X3X family of 24-bit & 16-bit precision successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The `AD4630-24 <http://www.analog.com/en/products/AD4630-24.html>`_ & `AD4630-16 <http://www.analog.com/en/products/AD4630-16.html>`_ are 2MSPS per channel, low power, dual channel 24-bit or 16-bit SAR ADCs while the `AD4030-24 <http://www.analog.com/en/products/AD4030-24.html>`_ is a single channel 24-bit precision SAR ADC that supports up to 2 MSPS per channel. The evaluation boards demonstrate the performance of either the AD4630-24, AD4030-24 or AD4630-16 and provides a configurable analog front end (AFE) for a variety of system applications. The evaluations board are designed for use with the Digilent `ZedBoard <http://digilent.com/shop/zedboard-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/>`_. The ZedBoard is used to control data capture and buffering. The evaluation board connects to the ZedBoard board via a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) mezzanine card (FMC) low pin count (LPC) connector. The ZedBoard hosts a Xilinx Zynq7000 SoC, which has two processor cores and programmable FPGA fabric. The ZedBoard connects to the PC through USB.

Setting Up the Evaluation Board
-------------------------------

Figure 1 illustrates the evaluation system components. To use the system, connect the evaluation board to the ZedBoard, connect a micro-USB cable to the USB OTG port, apply power to the ZedBoard, open the ACE GUI, and supply an input stimulus to one or both ADC channels.

Each ADC channel has dedicated SMA connectors that support either a singled-ended or differential input. The signals on these inputs are injected to the configurable AFE (see the **Analog Front End** section below for more details). The digital interface to the system controller board uses level shifters to translate between the VIO supply of the AD4630-16 and the I/O voltage of the Zynq 7000 on the ZedBoard. By default, the evaluation board is powered from the system controller board 12V supply through the FMC connector. The **Power Supplies** section contains a list of optional on-board connections that can be used to connect external supplies and references to the board.

Power Supplies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary 12V supply to the EVAL-AD4X30-XXFMCZ comes from the ZedBoard through the FMC connector. 12V is regulated down to an intermediate voltage with a switcher and then is post regulated down to the various voltage rails. 12V is also used to generate the negative rails for the buffers and final drive amplifiers.

Each of the voltage rails are brought out to turrets so they can be easily measured (see **Figure 1**). A bench supply can be used to drive these turrets to supply the evaluation board manually. This is useful if a current measurement is required. Each supply is decoupled where it enters the board and at each device. A single ground plane is used on this board to minimize the effect of high frequency interference. The voltage ranges listed in the table below represent the expected ranges for the board. If the user desires to connect external supplies to the board, the amplifier data sheets and the `AD4630-24 datasheet <http://www.analog.com/en/products/AD4630-24.html>`_, `AD4030-24 datasheet <http://www.analog.com/en/products/AD4030-24.html>`_ or `AD4630-16 datasheet <http://www.analog.com/en/products/AD4630-16.html>`_ should be consulted to ensure that the external supply values comply with the device requirements.

**Table 1. On-Board Power Supplies**

Reference Circuit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the on-board LT6655 provides a 5 V reference to the AD4630-24, AD4030-24 & AD4630-16. It drives the REFIN pin of the ADC through an R-C filter (R=100Ω, C=1μF) that reduces the low frequency noise. The REFIN pin is connected to an internal buffer, eliminating the need for an external buffer. However, if the user desires to use an external reference that drives the internal buffer, it can be attached the EXT REF SMA connector (see figure below). R137 should be populated with a zero ohm resistor, and R136 should be open. The internal buffer can be bypassed by attaching an external reference to the REF turret on the board. To reduce the ADC power consumption, the internal reference buffer can be disabled (see respective products data sheet).

|image2| **Figure 3. EVAL-AD4X30-XXFMCZ Reference circuit (AD4630-24 shown. Configuration applies to all parts)**

Clock Circuit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ZedBoard uses a 100MHz reference clock to generate its internal clocks as well as the sample clock for the AD4630-24, AD4030-24 or AD4630-16. To simplify system operation an on-board 100MHz, low-jitter crystal oscillator (XO) on the EVAL-AD4X30-XXFMCZ board supplies this clock as the default configuration, as shown in the figure below. To use an external clock source, remove R55 and connect an external clock source to J1, the CLK IN SMA. **The external clock frequency must be < 100 MHz**. The user should take care to use a low jitter clock source to achieve best system performance. The external clock level should be 10 to 12 dBm.

|image3| **Figure 4. EVAL-AD4X30-XXFMCZ clock circuit (AD4630-24 shown. Configuration applies to all parts)**

Analog Front End
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-AD4X30-XXFMCZ has a flexible driver network that can be configured for a variety topologies. The default network is shown in Figure 5, in which the ADA4945-1 fully differential amplifier is driving the ADC. It can accommodate both single-ended and differential signal sources, and drives the ADC differentially. As populated, it has a unity gain. When using a single-ended source, the unused input should be terminated with the equivalent source impedance. **Note:** As implemented, the AD4945-1 driver on the evaluation board preserves the differential value of IN+ - IN- (with appropriate gain scaling applied), but inverts the signal polarity that is injected to the ADC. Hence, if a positive DC signal is applied to the input, it should be attached to IN_A/B-, and likewise, a negative DC signal should be attached to IN_A/B+ to preserve the signal polarity.

**Table 2. EVAL-AD4620-16FMCZ Default AFE Configuration**

A second topology can be seen in Figure 6. This topology consists of a pair of unity gain buffers, the ADA4896-2. It also can be driven by either a singled-ended or differential source. This network is ideal for observing the best noise performance of the AD4630-16, due to the low voltage and current noise of the ADA4896-2 (1 nV/rtHz and 2.8 pA/rtHz, respectively). It also offers a common mode input impedance of 10 MΩ and a wide input common mode voltage range of -4.9V to +4.1V (when using +/- 5V supplies). **Note:** This driver circuit also inverts the polarity of the input signal. To preserve polarity when measuring DC voltages, connect a positive voltage to IN_A/B-. Likewise, a negative DC voltage should be connected to IN_A/B+.

**Table 3. Unity Gain Dual Buffer Configuration**

Figure 7 shows a driver network which combines the ADA4896-2 with the ADA4945-1. This circuit is ideal for applications that require a high input impedance along with gain to maximize the input range of the ADC. The gain of the ADA4945-1 can modified by changing either the feedback resistors or input resistors.

In case necessary, it is possible to supply all the LDOs directly with external power supplies via J7 and J8. There is also two different options to generate the -3.3V although only the LT3093 is mounted on the board. |image8| **Figure 10. Power-tree**

Reference Circuit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the on-board ADR4550 provides a 5 V reference to the AD4630-24 & AD4630-16. It drives the REFIN pin of the ADC through an R-C filter (R=100Ω, C=22μF) that reduces the low frequency noise. The REFIN pin is connected to an internal buffer, eliminating the need for an external buffer. However, if the user desires to use an external reference that drives the internal buffer, it can be attached the J5 SMA connector (see figure below). R124 should be populated with a zero ohm resistor, and R116 and R123 should be open. The internal buffer can be bypassed by attaching an external reference to the REF turret on the board. To reduce the ADC power consumption, the internal reference buffer can be disabled (see respective products data sheet). There is also the option to mount the LTC6655 or the LTC6655LN reference which is suitable to use it together with the unbuffered input of the ADC.

|image9| **Figure 11. EVAL-AD4630-XXFMCZ Reference circuit (AD4630-24 shown. Configuration applies to all parts)**

Clock Circuit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ZedBoard uses a 100MHz reference clock to generate its internal clocks as well as the sample clock for the AD4630-24 or AD4630-16. To simplify system operation an on-board 100MHz, low-jitter crystal oscillator (XO) on the EVAL-AD4630-XXFMCZ board supplies this clock as the default configuration, as shown in the figure below. To use an external clock source, remove R1 and connect an external clock source to J6, the CLK IN SMA. **The external clock frequency must be < 100 MHz**. The user should take care to use a low jitter clock source to achieve best system performance. The external clock level should be 10 to 12 dBm.

|image10| **Figure 12. EVAL-AD4630-XXFMCZ clock circuit (AD4630-24 shown. Configuration applies to all parts)**

Analog Front End
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-AD4630-XXFMCZ has a flexible driver network that can be configured for a variety topologies. The default network is shown in Figure 13, in which the ADA4945-1 fully differential amplifier is driving the ADC. It can accommodate both single-ended and differential signal sources, and drives the ADC differentially. As populated, it has a unity gain. When using a single-ended source, the unused input should be terminated with the equivalent source impedance. **Note:** As implemented, the AD4945-1 driver on the evaluation board preserves the differential value of IN+ - IN- (with appropriate gain scaling applied), but inverts the signal polarity that is injected to the ADC. Hence, if a positive DC signal is applied to the input, it should be attached to IN_A/B-, and likewise, a negative DC signal should be attached to IN_A/B+ to preserve the signal polarity.

**Table 7. EVAL-AD4620-16FMCZ Default AFE Configuration**

There is one buffer used to generate common mode voltage, U26. The voltage can be adjusted from 0V to Vref by selecting correctly the ratio between R98, (or R122 or R99) and R5.

|image12| **// Figure 14. Common mode voltage generation //**

A second topology can be seen in Figure 15. This topology consists of a pair of unity gain buffers, the ADA4896-2. It also can be driven by either a singled-ended or differential source. This network is ideal for observing the best noise performance of the AD4630-16, due to the low voltage and current noise of the ADA4896-2 (1 nV/rtHz and 2.8 pA/rtHz, respectively). It also offers a common mode input impedance of 10 MΩ and a wide input common mode voltage range of -4.9V to +4.1V (when using +/- 5V supplies). To use the full span of the ADC the input signal of each buffer needs to be centered at 2.5V

**Table 8. Unity Gain Dual Buffer Configuration**

If the signal generator connected to the inputs of the ADC cannot generate a DC offset, there is the option to use the VOCM buffer to create an DC offset and connect it to the non-inverting input of the ADA4896 amplifiers like Figure 16.

Another option available (Figure 17) on the board is to use the ADA4896 in an inverting configuration with the possibility of connecting an DC offset on the non-inverting pin. I this case it is necessary to have two input signals delayed 180º and select the correct resistors values to generate a 2.5V (R98 and R3) as VOCM.

Controller Board
----------------

The ZedBoard, which is the system controller board, enables the configuration of the ADC and capture of data from the evaluation board by the PC via USB (or Ethernet). The AD4X30-XX family of parts support a multi-lane serial port interface (SPI) for each data converter channel. The SPI interface for each channel is connected to the ZedBoard via the FMC connector (P1). The ZedBoard™ functions as the communication link between the PC and connected evaluation board. It buffers samples captured from the evaluation board in its DDR3 memory. The ZedBoard board requires power from a 12V wall adapter (included with the ZedBoard). It hosts a Xilinx® ZYNQ® 7020 SoC, which contains two ARM® Cortex-A9 Processors and a Series-7 FPGA with 85k Programmable Logic cells. A Linux OS runs on the host processor system. It communicates with the PC through either a USB 2.0 high speed port or a 10/100/1000 Ethernet port. The default software configuration uses USB.

System Operational Constraints
------------------------------

Sampling Frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table illustrates the maximum sampling rates that can be achieved based on the device configuration. Note that the FPGA SPI engine only supports Zone 2 data transfers from the AD4630/AD4030.

**Table 11. Maximum sampling rate by device configuration **^ Clocking Mode ^ Lane Mode (per channel) ^ Data Rate ^ Data format ^ Max sampling rate ^ \| SPI \| 1 \| Single (SDR) \| 32-bit \| 1.75 MSPS (**note 1**) \| \|     \|     \| SDR \| 24-bit \| 2 MSPS \| \|     \|     \| Dual (DDR) \| 32 or 24-bit \| 2 MSPS \| \|     \| 2 \| SDR or DDR \| 32 or 24-bit \| 2 MSPS \| \|     \| 4 \| SDR or DDR \| 32 or 24-bit \| 2 MSPS \| \| Echo Clock \| 1 \| SDR \| 32-bit \| 1.75 MSPS (**note 1**) \|

=== === ========== ============ ======
        SDR        24-bit       2 MSPS
        DDR        32 or 24-bit 2 MSPS
    2   SDR or DDR 32 or 24-bit 2 MSPS
    4   SDR or DDR 32 or 24-bit 2 MSPS
=== === ========== ============ ======

**Note 1**: The sampling rate in Single lane, 32-bit output formats in SDR mode are limited by the FPGA SPI engine. This is not a limitation of the AD4630/AD4030 device.
