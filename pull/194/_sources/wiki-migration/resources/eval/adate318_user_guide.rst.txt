The :adi:`ADATE318` datasheet provide additional information and should be consulted when using the evaluation board. All documents and software tools are available at the :adi:`ADATE318` main page.

Quick Start Guide
=================

-  Install the Software

   -  Insert the CD that contains the evaluation software to the PC then run “setup.exe” from CD-ROM. This will install the relevant USB drivers and software to your PC.
   -  Software should be installed prior to connection of the evaluation board to the PC’s USB port to ensure the board is correctly recognized by the PC.
   -  All software, documentation and setup files will be copied to
      C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\ADATE318
      Evaluation Board Software by default.

-  Plug in the hardware

   -  Using the USB cable, connect the EVAL-ADATE318 to the computer.
   -  You will be prompted to install the USB drivers. The software should find
      these drivers automatically. You may be required to restart your PC after
      the installation.

-  Unplug the USB cable then apply power supplies.

   -  Now you are ready to use the ADATE318 board.
   -  Disconnect the USB cable (Power rails should always be applied prior to USB cable).
   -  Apply appropriate power supplies

      -  +21VDC = +21V
      -  -10VDC = -10V
      -  GND = 0V

   -  Connect the USB cable again then launch the software.

-  Running the Evaluation Software.

   -  Browse for ADATE318 Evaluation Board Software in your Start menu.

-  Verifying you are communicating with the Hardware

   -  When the software launches, the main window will open if there are no issues. A command prompt indicating errors will pop up otherwise.
   -  To verify the communication with the hardware, a Read All command may be
      initiated. The software will reflect the default values upon power up if
      there is successful communication.

ADATE318 Device Description
===========================

The :adi:`ADATE318` is a complete, single-chip ATE solution that performs the pin electronics functions of driver, comparator, and active load (DCL), four quadrant, per pin, parametric measurement unit (PPMU). It has VHH drive capability per chip to support flash memory testing applications and integrated 16-bit DACs with an on-chip calibration engine to provide all necessary dc levels for operation of the part.

The driver features three active states: data high, data low, and terminate
mode, as well as a high impedance inhibit state. The inhibit state, in
conjunction with the integrated dynamic clamps, facilitates the implementation
of a high speed active termination. The output voltage capability is −1.5 V to
+6.5 V to accommodate a wide range of ATE and instrumentation applications.

The :adi:`ADATE318` can be used as a dual, single-ended drive/ receive channel or as a single differential drive/receive channel. Each channel of the ADATE318 features a high speed window comparator as well as a programmable threshold differential comparator for differential ATE applications. A four quadrant PPMU is also provided per channel. All dc levels for DCL and PPMU functions are generated by 24 on-chip 16-bit DACs. To facilitate accurate levels programming, the :adi:`ADATE318` contains an integrated calibration function to correct gain and offset errors for each functional block. Correction coefficients can be stored on chip, and any values written to the DACs are automatically adjusted using the appropriate correction factors.

The :adi:`ADATE318` uses a serial programmable interface (SPI) bus to program all functional blocks, DACs, and on-chip calibration constants. It also has an on-chip temperature sensor and over/undervoltage fault clamps for monitoring and reporting the device temperature and any output pin or PPMU voltage faults that may occur during operation.

=========================

Power Supplies
--------------

The following external supplies must be provided:

-  21V between +21VDC and GND.
-  -10V between -10VDC and GND.

GND input is provided on the board. Each device supply is decoupled to GND with
10μF and 0.1μF capacitors. Each device supply pin is again decoupled with a
0.1μF capacitor to GND.

Default Jumper Setup
--------------------

The default setup is for control by the PC via the USB port. The default link
options are listed in Table 1.

Using the ADATE318 Evaluation Board
-----------------------------------

The :adi:`ADATE318` board requires on two voltage supplies (+21V and -10V). These supplies are enough to power the entire board including the digital portion. This board also has SMA provision for both the inputs and outputs. Recommended to be controlled via USB, this board can be used with the provided software for easy access to user registers within :adi:`ADATE318`. Designed to be interactive, the ADATE318BCPZ also features an LED array at the bottom portion to help the user know that the correct data are being written to or read from the part.

Evaluation board Software
=========================

Software Operation
------------------

To launch the software, select the :adi:`ADATE318` submenu from the Analog Devices menu or use Windows Search. Next, click :adi:`ADATE318` Evaluation Software. The main window of the :adi:`ADATE318` software looks as follows:

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/adate318.jpg

This allows control of all the main functions of the :adi:`ADATE318` and access to the DAC registers as required. The main window of the software include three sections. One of them is the DAC Levels section which allows the user to write to the DACs within :adi:`ADATE318` either all in one click or singly. The Single Read and Write section meanwhile allows the user to read or write to a specific register, may it be a DAC register or a control register. The Control Register section lets the user configure the settings of :adi:`ADATE318`.

DAC Level Registers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DAC Level Registers section, located at the upper left of the user interface, lists all the current settings of the DACs within :adi:`ADATE318`. Changing the values at a text field and pressing 'Enter' in this section is equivalent to writing that value to the specific DAC. The corresponding value (HEX code or Voltage) will change accordingly.

This section also lets the user load or save register settings for all DAC and
Control registers for quicker testing.

Single Read and Write Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section of the user interface makes it easy for the user to write to or
read from specific registers as desired. Note that when reading from a register,
it is not necessary to fill the data field as this field will show the data read
from the part.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/adate318_read_write.jpg

Control Registers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It would have been difficult for the user to manually fill the single write section to configure the settings of :adi:`ADATE318`, thus this section is built to address this. This section allows modification of the part's settings by letting the user know which register is being written to, and what specific setting is being changed. Alarms can also be read from this section.
