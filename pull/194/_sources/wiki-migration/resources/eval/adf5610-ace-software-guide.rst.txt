EV-ADF5610SD1Z ACE SOFTWARE USER GUIDE
======================================

Software Installation Procedures
--------------------------------

You can install the EV-ADF5610SD1Z plug-in from the ACE start-up page.

-  You can install ACE from http://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/ace-software.html.
-  On the ACE start-up page locate and click the **Plug-in Manager** on the side bar.
-  Select Available Packages from the panel second side bar
-  Search for Board.ADF5610 and install plug-in

Evaluation Board Set-up
-----------------------

To run the plug-in, perform the following steps:

-  After installation, double click the ADF5610 icon that appears on the **Attached Hardware** tab when the SDP board is connected and attached to the board. If the icon does not appear, consider re-installing the ADF510 plug-in or try refreshing Attached hardware icon.
-  Connection is automatically established with the :adi:`SDP-S` when you navigate into the front panel of the Board plug-in

GENERAL SOFTWARE FEATURES
-------------------------

Main Controls
-------------

The **RF Output Controls** tab (see figure 2) contains the RF settings for control of the output frequency. Consult the register descriptions for the :adi:`ADF5610` datasheet for details. Ensure that the value of the **External Reference Frequency** box equals the applied reference signal. The **External Reference Frequency** is set to 50MHz by default, which is the frequency of the on-board reference source. The PFD frequency is calculated from the reference frequency, the R counter, the reference doubler, and the reference divide by 2. Ensure that the value in the **f_PFD (MHz)** box matches the value specified in the loop filter design.

General Controls
----------------

The **General Controls** tab (see Figure 3) contains the other register settings, as described in the :adi:`ADF5610` data sheet.

VCO Subsystems Controls
-----------------------

The **VCO Subsystems controls** lets you set the VCO register parameters, as described in the :adi:`ADF5610` data sheet. There is also a section in the VCO subsystems tab to **readback subbands** of the current frequency by a simple button click. The subband values are returned for the current RF VCO frequency when **Read Subband** is pressed.

Sweep and Hop Controls
----------------------

**Sweep and Hop Control** lets you perform **Sweep** or **Hop** when **Autocalibration** is enabled or disabled.

Sweep
~~~~~

-  To sweep between frequencies with **Autocalibration** enabled, first define start VCO frequency, stop VCO frequency and channel spacing. This will start sweep using the frequencies while the **Autocalibration subband table** is populated with the sweep frequencies and subbands.
-  To sweep using subbands, the **Autocalibration Subbands** table must be populated with the subbands from **Autocalibration sweep**. When Autocalibration is disabled and sweep is started, sweep will be use the subbands on the Autocalibration Subbands table.

Autocalibration Subbands Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three buttons on the top righthand corner of the Autocalibration
subband table used to control the data contained in the table.

-  The first button is used to import subband data saved in csv file stored in the local directory.
-  The second button icon is used to export a copy of the subband data in csv format in a local directory.
-  The third button is used to add a single sweep step to the table using the
   current VCO start frequency.

The **Autocalibration subbands** table can be cleared using the **clear table** button under the table. Finally, a subband sweep can be performed at random by using the delete icon on each column to delete a sweep step or define a VCO start frequency and use the add button to add the sweep step to the table.

Hop
~~~

Similar to the Sweep, you can hop between two frequencies.

-  When Autocalibration is active, it automatically calibrates the subband needed for that particular frequency.
-  For frequency hop in manual mode, run Autocalibrate using the **Calibrate** button to obtain the start and stop subbands. These subbands are pre-loaded into subbands A and B field, and Autocalibration is deactivated. Frequency hop is then executed with the known subbands loaded into the device.

EVALUATION AND TEST
-------------------

To evaluate and test the performance of the EV-ADF5610SD1Z use the following
procedure. To ensure the software is able to program the device correctly,
follow these few steps as they appear anytime the board is powered up.

-  Connect the USB cable from the :adi:`SDP-S` board.
-  Connect the 6V power supply to the VCC 6.1V SMA (J7) connector, but ensure power supply is turned off.
-  Connect the USB cable from the :adi:`SDP-S` board to the PC
-  Run the ACE software.
-  Select ADF5610 that appears on the Attached Hardware connection tab and navigate to the main controls of the ADF5610.
-  Power the 6V power supply.
-  Connect the spectrum analyzer to SMA Connector RFOUT (J1).
-  If the board is configured for external reference, connect the reference to the SMA Connector REFIN (J4). Ensure the external reference match the value on the software main control.
-  Click Write All Registers in the bottom right corner of the RF Control tab.
-  Measure the output spectrum and single sideband phase noise.

Read Subband Register
---------------------

You should attempt to read subband only when Autocalibration is enabled. This is because the **Subband Register** is updated when Autocalibration is enabled before navigating to desired frequency:

-  Select desired VCO frequency you want to read subband and **Apply Changes**.
-  Navigate to the **VCO Subsystem** tab and hit the readback subband button.
