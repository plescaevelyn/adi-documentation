Serial Communication Classification Protocol (SCCP) with the LTC4296-1
======================================================================

Introduction
------------

Serial Communication Classification Protocol (SCCP) allows for an IEEE 802.3cg,
Single-pair Power over Ethernet (SPoE) compliant Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)
to classify a compliant Powered Device (PD) before power is applied to a cable.
Through SCCP, information on device class, type, pd_faulted, and Cable
resistance measurements enabled/disabled can be obtained.

This Wiki provides an application circuitry overview, SCCP transactions
overview, sample C code SCCP implementation, evaluation guidance and reference
material for class and type. The sample C code may be used as a starting point
for integrating SPoE power management into a system host microcontroller.

SCCP APPLICATION CIRCUITRY
--------------------------

The SCCP was derived from the 1-Wire® protocol and utilizes a half-duplex,
bi-directional open-drain bus where the PSE or PD can pull-down. Figure 1
illustrates an SPoE system featuring the LTC4296-1 PSE, the LTC9111 PD, an
application host microcontroller, and ADIN1100 10BASE-T1L PHYs. Only one of five
LTC4296-1 ports is shown, and the "x" suffix denotes pin names as a function of
port number.

The LTC4296-1 SCCP related components include pulldown MOSFET M3, line sense NPN
BJT transistor Q1, snubber disconnect MOSFET M2, the LTC4296-1 SWx pin, and the
host microcontroller GPOx and GPIx pins. The microcontroller's GPOx pin drives
M3 to pulldown the line voltage while Q1 limits the maximum voltage sensed at
the GPIx pin. Snubber R3/C4 is provided for loop stability during inrush and
current limit of high-side MOSFET M1 and is disconnected during PD detection and
SCCP. Secondary snubber R5/C5 prevents excess ringing at the OUTPx pin when
snubber R3/C4 is disconnected.

Microcontroller requirements for implementing SCCP are:

-  Per port GPO pin (SCCPOx)
-  Per Port GPI pin with ADC functionality (SCCPIx)
-  A timer with resolution of at least 1us

At the PSE, the LTC4296-1 is set up for the classification state by the microcontroller. Classification is configured by setting the software PSE ready bit (PxCFG0, Bit6, SW_PSE_READY) and the classification mode bit (PXCFG0, Bit 13, SET_CLASSIFICATION_MODE) before entering the detection state. If the microcontroller determines a valid PD with a compatible class is present, the port can proceed to the power-up state by setting the port software power available bit (Register PxCFG0, Bit 5, SW_POWER_AVAILABLE) and the end classification bit (Register PxCFG0, Bit 14, END_CLASSIFICATION). Further description of port states can be found in the :adi:`LTC4296-1 Datasheet <media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ltc4296-1.pdf>`.

On the PD side, the LTC9111 detects the SCCP logic states on the lines through
SNS1 and SNS2 and uses external MOSFETs (M13/M14) to pull-down the port voltage
during classification in order to transmit a logic low. The use of two external
MOSFETs allows successful classification regardless of input connector polarity
configuration.

SCCP Transactions Overview
--------------------------

SCCP transactions are comprised of initialization, write slot, and read slot
protocols. The PSE initiates all protocols by pulling down the bus. The PSE also
provides a voltage limited pull-up current to restore the bus voltage to a logic
high. The PD uses the rectified voltage from the PSE pull-up to retain state
during pull-down events. Table 1 summarizes the basic SCCP protocols, and Figure
2-4 illustrates the corresponding waveforms.

   \ *Table 1. SCCP Protocols*\

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PSE initiates the SCCP transaction by pulling down on the bus during the reset pulse. After which the PD responds with a pull-down presence pulse. During the reset pulse, the PSE pulls down on the bus voltage below the input logic low voltage, V\ :sub:`TL` (2V PSE, 1V PD), for reset time low time, t\ :sub:`RSTL` (8ms-10.5ms).

Once the PSE releases the bus, the PD detects the rising edge cross the input logic high voltage V\ :sub:`TH` (3V) and waits the presence-detect high time, t\ :sub:`PDH` (0.7ms-1.3ms), before transmitting a presence pulse. The PSE samples for the PD presence pulse by t\ :sub:`MSP` (1.8ms-2.2ms). The PD holds the presence pulse for the presence-detect low time, t\ :sub:`PDL` (2.8ms-5.2ms).

|image2|

.. container:: centeralign

   *Figure 2. SCCP Initialization*

Write Time Slot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The duration of the write time slot for either a '0' or '1' should last for a maximum of t\ :sub:`WRITESLOT` (2.78ms). When the PSE writes a '0' to the PD, first the PSE pulls down the bus voltage below the V\ :sub:`TL`, then the PSE releases within the write 0 low time, t\ :sub:`W0L` (1.8ms-2.2ms), as seen in Figure 3. In the case where the PSE aims to write a '1', the PSE pulls down on the bus voltage, and then it releases the line within the write 1 low time, t\ :sub:`W1L` (0.09ms-0.61ms), as illustrated in Figure 3. See Figures 26-29 for example waveforms.

|image3|

.. container:: centeralign

   *Figure 3. SCCP Write Time Slot*

Read Time Slot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PSE initiates the read time slot by pulling low on the bus. Subsequently, the PSE releases the bus within t\ :sub:`W1L`, at which point the PD responds by pulling the bus low for the read 0 low time, t\ :sub:`R0L` (1.75ms-3.25ms), in order to transmit a '0' (Figure 4). Alternatively, if the intention is to transmit a '1', the PD refrains from pulling the bus low after the read 1 low time, t\ :sub:`W1L`. This read time slot is repeated for each PD bit, see Figure 30-34 for example waveforms. The PD sends data LSB first. Each of these read time slots has a maximum duration of t\ :sub:`READSLOT` (3.83ms).

|image4|

.. container:: centeralign

   *Figure 4. SCCP Read Time Slot*

Additional Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following an Initialization Sequence or a Write/Read Time Slot, there is a recovery time of t\ :sub:`REC` (0.27ms-0.33ms). This recovery time begins from the moment the PSE OUTPx voltage exceeds the V\ :sub:`TH` threshold and extends until the bus voltage begins to get pulled down. Additionally, the bus voltage during any transaction must have a rise time from GND to V\ :sub:`TH` within t\ :sub:`R` (0.025ms-0.5ms). It must have a fall time from V\ :sub:`PUP` (4.7V-5.5V) to V\ :sub:`TL` within t\ :sub:`F` (0.025ms-0.25ms). The PD Reservoir Capacitor Recharge Time, denoted as t\ :sub:`CHRG`, extending from when the voltage on the bus crosses the V\ :sub:`CHRG` threshold (4.23V) to the commencement of the bus voltage being pulled down, must exceed 0.2ms.

SCCP Transaction Waveform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure 5 illustrates a basic example SCCP transaction. The two waveforms are:

-  Ch1: Differential voltage at PSE MDI/PI connector
-  Ch2: Voltage at LTC9111's SCCP pin relative to GND_PD

Note SCCP data is read/written LSB first, low byte first.

The basic SCCP transaction is comprised of: i. Initialization ii. Write
Broadcast Address (0xCC)

-  Following the Initialization Sequence, the PSE proceeds with a Broadcast
   Address write operation. During this operation, the PSE transmits 0xCC to the
   PD. This is used to address a PD on the bus without sending out a unique
   address code information.

iii. Write Read_Scratchpad Command (0xAA)

-  Subsequent to the Broadcast Address write operation, the PSE sends a
   Read-Scratchpad Command (0xAA). This command configures the PD for subsequent
   two-byte CLASS_TYPE_INFO read plus CRC byte read operation.

iv. Read PD CLASS_TYPE_INFO Low Byte

-  Following the Read_Scratchpad Command, the PD sends the Low Byte of its
   CLASS_TYPE_INFO to the PSE.

v. Read PD CLASS_TYPE_INFO High Byte

-  After the Low Byte of the CLASS_TYPE_INFO is transmitted the PD sends the
   High Byte of the ClASS_TYPE_INFO to the PSE. Interpretation of
   CLASS_TYPE_INFO is located in Table 7 & 9 located in the Appendix section of
   this Wiki.

vi. Read PD CRC Byte

-  In the final step, the PSE reads the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value of
   the PD. This value is derived from the received scratchpad class info word.

SCCP Read Registers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Figure 12 shows example code for sccp_read_register(). The sccp_read_register() intializes the bus, checks for a PD presence pulse, writes the broadcast address command byte (0xCC) followed by the passed read command byte (cmd), and then reads two bytes of PD data plus the CRC byte. The PD data bytes plus CRC byte are stored at the address of the passed \*buf pointer.

Example Detection, Classification, and Power-up Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure 14 provides example code sccp_do_class() for implementing detection,
SCCP, and then power-up one or more ports when the PSE and PD and PSE classes
are compatible. The code assumes intialization of the following peripherals:

-  Timer Initialization
-  SPI peripheral for communicating with LTC4296-1
-  Per port GPI and GPO for supporting SCCP

Outline of sccp_do_class():

-  1. For each port 'x':

   -  Check if port_supports_class[x] is True

      -  Confirm LTC4296-1 port has not already powered-up with read of port
         status {pxst.pse_status != (PSE_STATUS_DELIVERING or
         PSE_STATUS_SLEEPING or PSE_STATUS_UNKNOWN)}

         -  Go to next port if either a or b are false, otherwise go to 2.

-  2. Read LTC4296-1 port configuration register 0 (pxcfg0) and save into 'pxcfg0_old' variable
-  3. Disable LTC4296-1 write protection, and write the following bits to the
   pxcfg0 register:

   -  pxcfg0.sw_en = 1

      -  pxcfg0.sw_pse_ready = 1

         -  pxcfg0.set_classification_mode = 1
         -  pxcfg0.tdet_disable = 1

-  4. If pxst.pse_status fails to go to searching (011b) after 4ms, restore pxcfg0 register contents and go to next port, else proceed to 5.
-  5. Check PD detection signature (required by IEEE 802.3bu/cg before going to
   SCCP):

   -  initialize t_det_start from timer

      -  While time elapsed since t_det_start is less than 3.1ms:

         -  If pxst.det_vlow = 0 & pxst.det_vhi = 0 (valid PD signature
            voltage), increment t_hold timer, else reset t_hold

            -  If elapsed time since t_det_start > 3.1ms and t_hold < 1ms set
               valid_signature = 0, elseif t_hold > 1ms set valid_signature = 1

-  6. Do SCCP (note IEEE 802.3bu/cg allows a PSE to power up w/out SCCP if
   valid_signature == 1):

   -  Call sccp_read_register() function and pass Read_Scratchpad command byte

      -  If no PD presence pulse was detected, restore pxcfg0 register contents
         with pxcfg0.sw_power_available=0 and go to next port.

         -  If PSE class and PD class are compatible (class_compatibility
            matrix), power up port by restoring old pxcfg0 register with
            pxcfg0.sw_power_available = 1, pxcfg0.sw_pse_ready = 1, and
            pxcfg0.sw_en = 1.

            -  If PSE class and PD class are incompatible, set pxcfg0.sw_en = 0

-  7. Go to next port or return if last port

SCCP Evaluation with EVAL-SPoE-KIT-AZ
-------------------------------------

Equipment for Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  EVAL-LTC4296-1-AZ: 5-port PSE controller LTC4296-1 motherboard
-  EVAL-LTC4296-1-RC-AZ: microcontroller card for driving LTC4296-1 motherboard
-  EVAL-10BT1L-SMC-AZ: Media Converters for PSE and PD motherboards
-  EVAL-LTC9111-AZ: PD controller LTC9111 motherboard

SCCP transaction can be evaluated with the EVAL-SPoE-KIT-AZ and the LTC4296-1
GUI. In the drop down menu, boxed in Figure 15, select the maximum PSE class and
select Type E. Select classify if classification without power is desired or
select power up for classification and subsequent powering up of the PD if it is
equal to or less than the maximum PSE class. Once successful power up of the PD
has occurred Power Good indicator should light up green as shown in Figure 16.
