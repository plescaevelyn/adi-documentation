Mechanical and Thermal Considerations
=====================================

Stacking Considerations
-----------------------

In order to maintain the dual-polarization lattice spacing of 7.5 mm between
on-tile HMC8108s and between tiles when stacked vertically, there are a few
things that need to be considered. The parts placement in layout needs to be
done so that there is no more than 7.5 mm of space between each Rx channel on
tile. Additionally, part heights need to be verified to make sure that stacking
is possible. The tallest component in the BOM for this design is the LTM8020
power module, coming in at 2.42mm. This ensures that the tiles can be vertically
stacked with leeway.

Another stacking consideration that is made is the choice of tile-to-backplane controls/data connector. The main points of concern for this connector selection are number of positions, right angle mount, part height, and on-board termination. For this application, the `SAMTEC ERF5-RA <https://www.samtec.com/products/erf5-ra>`_ right-angle board mounted socket is ideal. This connector has a height of 4.75mm while containing 100 positions and supporting high speed applications with up to 28 Gbps performance.

The same stacking consideration has to be made for the on-tile power connector. The main points of concern for this are voltage rating (12 V), continuous current rating (1.5 A) and surge current rating (4.5 A) in addition to the aforementioned physical specs including part height, PCB mount orientation and termination method. The standard `TSM-102-01-L-SH-P-TR <https://www.samtec.com/products/tsm-102-01-l-sh-p-tr>`_ surface mount 0.1000" pitch TSM series header from SAMTEC is ideal for fitting these specifications.

Thermal Considerations
----------------------

A steady-state thermal simulation on ANSYS FLUENT was conducted to assess the
thermal safety of the power dissipating devices in an eight-tile stackup using
preliminary on-tile parts placement. A fan was applied within the simulation
with a rotational speed of 3000 RPM that was positioned 200mm away from the
platform and blew laterally between the tiles. The results showed that with the
fan on at 3000 RPM, all devices on all eight boards are thermally safe with the
exception of the LTC6953 chip on Tile 6 in the stack. The simulation result is
shown below.

**Figure 2: Tile 6 Temperature Hotspot**

It is observed that on Tile 6, the junction temperature of the LTC6953 chip is
131.91 degrees Celsius, which is 1.91 degrees over the rated junction
temperature of the chip. It also seems that the main hotspot of each board is
centered around the LTC6953. This makes sense due to the relatively higher power
consumption of this chip compared to the other chips on the board. A few
potential solutions for this problem include shifting these chips closer to the
middle of the board so that there is more surface area for heat dissipation or
including thermal vias underneath the LTC6953 chips which may not be possible
due to the stacking considerations mentioned in the previous section.
