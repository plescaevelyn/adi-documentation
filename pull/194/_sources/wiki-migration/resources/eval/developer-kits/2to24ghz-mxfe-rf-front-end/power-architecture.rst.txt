Power Architecture Overview
===========================

The power solution for the 2-24GHz Front End provides regulation for the four major functional blocks in the system: the transmit chain, the receive chain, the LO chains, and the :adi:`AD9081` or :adi:`AD9082` MxFE with clocking solution.

The power for the transmit chain (shown below) features two switching regulators. One is the ultra-small :adi:`MAXM17632`, which delivers 1A at high efficiency from up to 36Vin in a tiny 3x3mm uSLICTM package. The other is the :adi:`ADP5600`, which integrates a low ripple interleaved inverting charge pump with a high performance LDO to easily produce clean negative voltages. The sensitive signal chain power domains are regulated by low noise, high performance linear regulators.

The power for the receive chain (shown below) follows a similar design philosophy as the transmit. It uses the same :adi:`MAXM17632` power module and highly integrated :adi:`ADP5600` to minimize the solution space. The sensitive power domains of the signal chain are regulated by low noise linear regulators.

The power for the LO chains (shown below) utilize two :adi:`MAXM17632` power modules and the :adi:`ADP5600`. These are accompanied by low noise linear regulators for the sensitive signal chain power domains.

The power solution for the MxFE and its clock (shown below) features Silent Switcher® technology. These high efficiency regulators, :adi:`LTM8051`, :adi:`LT8625S` and :adi:`LT8627S`, feature low EMI and output noise. Some power domains of the MxFE chip can be driven directly from a Silent Switcher® output, while the more sensitive ICs such as the :adi:`ADF4377` clock chip are further regulated by LDOs like the :adi:`LT3045`. The :adi:`LT3045` LDO features industry leading performance with 77dB PSRR at 1MHz.
