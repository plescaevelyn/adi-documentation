LO Generation Options
=====================

The 2-24GHz RF Front End has two different sets of LO specifications and requirements- one for the fixed LO sources and a second for the wideband, tunable LOs. Additionally, LO performance requirements vary widely across the instrumentation, communications, and aerospace & defense application space, so while a one-size-fits-all solution for the LO generation circuitry may not be practical, Analog Devices offers numerous, flexible options for wideband frequency synthesizers.

Fixed LO Source
---------------

The 18GHz, fixed LO source can be supplied by any integrated PLL/VCO such as the :adi:`ADF4371`, or a discrete LO implementation using ADI PLLs and quad-band VCOs for applications requiring lower phase noise. The frequency synthesizer circuit detailed in CN0568 (shown below), provides one possible solution for a discrete LO implementation using the :adi:`ADF41513` PLL and :adi:`HMC8362` quad-band VCO.

This circuit was adapted to provide a cleaner output tone (reduced spurs) and a higher output power with the following block diagram:

For this design, we selected a discrete LO implementation using the ADF41513 and the HMC8362 to achieve lower phase noise and power consumption. The following plot shows the simulated phase noise performance in ADI SimPLL:

Tunable LO Source
-----------------

The tunable LO synthesizer has a more complex set of requirements, many of which directly impact the system-level functionality of the signal chain, such as tuning speed and frequency coverage. The wideband frequency synthesizer circuit shown in the figure below uses the :adi:`ADF4371` integrated PLL/VCO, which is one potential option for the tunable LO source, enabling low phase-noise tuning across the RF signal chain’s full operating range. The tunable filtering on the :adi:`ADF4371` outputs is optional and dependent on the LO spurious requirements of the end system. The SPDT switch selects between the two :adi:`ADF4371` outputs and the :adi:`HMC383` driver amp ensure sufficient LO drive level at the mixer for optimal performance.
