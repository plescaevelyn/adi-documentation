Evaluation Board Hardware

The following instructions are for setting up the physical connections to the
AD9528/PCBZ. The user must install the evaluation software prior to connecting
the evaluation board to their PC.

Power Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`AD9528/PCBZ <EVAL-AD9528>` is setup by default to power the :adi:`AD9528` and remaining circuitry using the provided 6V wall power supply connected to drive an Analog Devices :adi:`ADP5052 5-channel integrated power solution <ADP5052>` which is configured to output 3.3V and 5V from two internal buck regulators. The evaluation board can be configured to power the AD9528 with one of three on board power configurations as shown in **Table 1**.

**Table 1. Power Supply Configuration Jumper Settings**

+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------+------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------+------------------------------+

PC Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following instructions assume that the power supply is correctly configured to one of the three configurations discussed in the **Power Connections** section.

-  Connect the wall power supply to the main power connector labeled P500.

   -  The red LED labeled 3V3_USB (DS4) will illuminate.
   -  The green LED labeled RESETB (DS3) will illuminate.

-  Connect the USB cable to the evaluation board and computer.

   -  The red LED labeled CR300 on the AD9528 evaluation board will illuminate.
   -  The red LED labeled USB_STATUS (CR2) will blink once the evaluation board
      has successfully communicated with the PC.

Refer to the Evaluation Board Software section for details on running the AD9528
evaluation board software.

Signal Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inputs
^^^^^^

The :adi:`AD9528/PCBZ <EVAL-AD9528>` has preinstalled connections for REFA, REFB, VCXO_IN, SYSREF_IN, and SYSREF_REQ. REFA and REFB are accessible via SMA connectors J27 and J4. A 0dBm sinusoidal input may be connected to these inputs to provide a reference signal to PLL1 of the :adi:`AD9528`. The :adi:`AD9528` can create an internally generated SYSREF signal or can provide a buffered external SYSREF by applying signals to SYSREF_IN via SMA connectors J6 and J7. A third SYSREF option allows an external trigger to initiate SYSREF pulse from the internal SYSREF generator. The SYSREF_REQ pin is accessible by 3 paths on the evaluation board:

-  **Using an External Signal on SMA Connector J30**

   -  Jumper P6 set to position 3 (EXTERNAL REQUEST)

-  **Using Push Button S1**

   -  Jumper P6 removed.

-  **Using the Evaluation Software GUI to Access the Pin Through the USB Controller**

   -  Jumper P6 set to position 1 (USB CONTROLLER REQUEST)

A low phase noise VCXO with single ended 3.3V CMOS output is populated by default. The :adi:`AD9528/PCBZ <EVAL-AD9528>` allows the user to use an external VCXO evaluation daughter board by utilizing J14 which is connected to the :adi:`AD9528` VCXO_VT pin and J101 which can be shorted to the :adi:`AD9528` VCXO_IN_P pin. The path connected to J101 can also be used to provide a reference to PLL with an external 3.3V CMOS source. A third path allows the :adi:`AD9528` to be configured as an asynchronous generator by using a small 3.3V CMOS XO on Y1. The following steps detail how to configure the :adi:`AD9528/PCBZ <EVAL-AD9528>` for the three different VCXO_IN input options:

Outputs
^^^^^^^

Connect an oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, or other lab equipment to any of the
horizontal OUTx inputs on the edge of the board. OUT0, OUT1, OUT11, and OUT12
are differentially terminated with 100Ω and ac coupled to SMA connectors J10-J13
and J34-J37. OUT4, OUT5, OUT8, and OUT9 are differentially terminated with 100Ω
and combined to one output via a balun to SMA connectors J18, J20, J26 and J29.
Baluns T8 and T13 can be removed and shorted so that both the positive and
negative outputs from OUT4 and OUT9 can be connected to SMA connectors.

Use the following steps to configure and lock both AD9528 PLLs by loading a
premade setup file.

-  Apply a 0dBm 122.88MHz signal to SMA connector J27 (REFA_P).
-  Download the **AD9528 Quick Start Setup File** found online on the :adi:`AD9528 Evaluation Board Page <EVAL-AD9528>`.
-  Once downloaded, the setup file can be loaded into the evaluation board by opening the AD9528 Evaluation Software, click File> Load Setup, and select the appropriate .stp file.
-  A prompt will display that the settings from the setup file have been loaded
   into the AD9528. A VCO calibration is needed to lock the output PLL to the
   new AD9528 settings. Press Yes to perform a VCO calibration and output
   synchronization.
