DEMO MANUAL EVAL-ADBMS1818
==========================

**ADBMS1818 Daisy Chain isoSPI Battery-Stack Monitor**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Demonstration circuit EVAL_ADBMS1818 is a multicell battery stack monitor
featuring the ADBMS1818, an 18-cell monitor on the EVAL_ADBMS1818. Multiple
boards can be linked through a 2-wire isolated serial interface (isoSPI) to
monitor any number of cells in a stack. The demo circuit also features
reversible isoSPI enabling a fully redundant communication path.

The EVAL_ADBMS1818 can communicate to a PC by connecting directly to a DC2026
Linduino® One. The DC2026 must be loaded with the appropriate program (called a
“sketch”) to control the battery stack monitor IC and receive data through a USB
serial port. The DC2792/DC1941 can be connected to the DC2026 to provide a fully
isolated isoSPI interface to the EVAL_ADBMS1818.

Design files for this circuit board are available at `www.analog.com/en/products/adbms1818.html <http://www.analog.com/en/products/adbms1818.html>`_

Evaluation board Schematic is available here: `eval-adbms1818_schematic.pdf <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/eval-adbms1818_schematic.pdf>`_

HARDWARE SETUP
--------------

Wiring J4 Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL_ADBMS1818 demo circuits (boards) have different connector pinouts. It
is critical that the correct wiring is followed or there is a risk of damaging
the demo board.

When connected to a battery stack, power for the EVAL_ADBMS1818 is provided by
the cell group being monitored. To connect the cell group, separate the
screw-terminal block section from the J4 connector. Then, insert the
cell-voltage connections or resistors into the screw-terminal clamping contacts.
These connections provide the power and input stimulus for the battery stack
monitor IC.

Cell-voltages are wired to J4 starting from position 1 (most negative potential
of the group). Please reference the appropriate demo board J4 connector pinout
in Tables 1 and 2.

Alternatively, resistors can be used to simulate battery cell-voltages. 100Ω
0.5W or equivalent resistors are recommended because 100Ω (or lower values)
typically will not induce measurement errors and the 0.5W (or greater rating)
will keep the resistor temperatures low preventing power dissipation damage.

EVAL_ADBMS1818 18 Resistor Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carefully connect eighteen 100Ω resistors between each screw-terminal block
clamping contact from position 1 to position 19 as shown in Table 2,
EVAL_ADBMS1818 J4 Pinout. Provide a stack-equivalent power supply connection to
position 19 (positive) and position 1 (negative). The power supply may be
adjusted to provide the desired nominal cell-voltage (e.g. 59.4V will be 3.3V
per cell).

JUMPERS
-------

The demo board jumpers must be set to match the desired mode of operation. The
jumpers enable the Discharge Timer and select the serial communication mode to
the battery stack monitor IC.

ISOMD Jumpers JP1–JP3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0: Set jumpers to 0 for standard SPI communication to the IC through the J3
connector.

1: Set jumpers to 1 for isoSPI communication to the IC through either the J1 or
J2 connector.

SWTEN Jumper JP4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0: Set jumpers to 0 for Discharge Timer disable.

1: Set jumpers to 1 for Discharge Timer enable.

EVAL_ADBMS1818 SERIAL INTERFACE OPTIONS
---------------------------------------

The EVAL_ADBMS1818 has several communication options. The DC2026 Linduino One
provides a USB-to-SPI interface, and is ideal to interface from a PC to any SPI
device. In this case, the DC2026 SPI interface can connect directly to the
EVAL_ADBMS1818 (see section entitled DC2026 to EVAL_ADBMS1818 SPI Connection for
details). Alternately, the DC2026 SPI can be translated to isoSPI via the DC2792
or DC1941 demo boards. The DC2792 is a dual master isoSPI demo board which can
be connected as a typical single-ended isoSPI bus master or to both ends of a
reversible con-figuration with two isoSPI bus masters. The DC1941 can be
connected as a typical single-ended isoSPI bus master.

USING OTHER SPI MASTER BOARDS
-----------------------------

When a different SPI master microcontroller board is used instead of the DC2026,
more components or equipment are required to properly interface to the demo
boards. Here are the requirements:

SPI MISO Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most SPI master microcontroller boards will not have a SPI MISO line pull-up. A
5kΩ pull-up resistor is required on the SPI MISO line because the battery stack
monitor IC SDO is an open drain NMOS output pin. Otherwise, the SPI MISO line
will be floating where the SPI readback of each byte will typically appear as no
response or all ones or 0xFFs. There are several places where the pull-up
resistor can be installed. On the EVAL_ADBMS1818, a 0603 size 5kΩ resistor can
be soldered onto R8 or on the microcontroller board, a 5kΩ resistor can be added
between the micro-controller SPI MISO line and the microcontroller VCC pin.

isoSPI IC Power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A separate 5V power supply is required when using a different SPI master
microcontroller board. The DC2026 J1 header provides power for the isoSPI IC
through the 14-pin ribbon cable into the DC2792 J1 header or the DC1941 J2
header. Refer to demo manual DC2792A or demo manual DC1941D for external power
supply instructions.

EVAL_ADBMS1818 SPI CONNECTION
-----------------------------

An SPI connection begins with the SPI master con-nected to the first (or
“bottom”) EVAL_ADBMS1818. Additional EVAL_ADBMS1818 boards can be daisy-chained
onto the isoSPI bus. Communication begins from the first (or “bottom”)
EVAL_ADBMS1818 then to the next “upper” EVAL_ADBMS1818 then finally to the last
(or “top”) EVAL_ADBMS1818.

The EVAL_ADBMS1818 can be controlled by the DC2026 Linduino One board. The
DC2026 is part of the Arduino compatible Linduino platform that provides example
code that will demonstrate how to control the multicell battery stack monitor
ICs. Compared to most Arduino compatible microcontroller boards, the DC2026
offers conveniences such as an isolated USB connection to the PC, built-in SPI
MISO line pull-up to properly interface with the battery stack monitor IC open
drain SDO, and an easy rib-bon cable connection for SPI communication through
the EVAL_ADBMS1818 14-pin QuikEval J3 connector.

APPENDIX A THE SKETCHBOOK CONTENTS
----------------------------------

The bmsSketchbook will generally contain the follow-ing folders: Libraries, Part
Number, Documentation, and Utilities.

**Libraries directory:** contains a subdirectory for each IC in the sketchbook. Each subdirectory contains a .cpp and .h file. These files contain all of the constant definitions and low-level IC command implementations. Porting to a different microcontroller requires changes to some library files.

**Part Number directory:** contains example control pro-grams for each IC. Inside the Part Number folder, each BMS IC has a sketch(.ino) file that implements a control program to evaluate the functionality of the IC. This sketch allows the user to control the IC through a serial terminal and make all primary measurements. This sketch also allows for evaluation of self-test and discharge features of the IC. Generally, the name of a sketch relates to the IC’s demo board. For example, the sketch for LTC6804 is DC1942.ino, for LTC6811 it is DC2259.ino, and for ADBMS1818 it is EVAL_ADBMS1818.ino.

**Utilities directory:** contains support programs, including a program that emulates a standard Linear Technology DC590 isolated USB to serial controller.

**Documentation directory:** contains html documentation for the provided code base. Documentation for all of the BMS ICs can be accessed by opening the Linduino.html file, as found in the main sketchbook directory (shown below) and in the Documentation directory.

What Is A Sketch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A “sketch” is simply another word for a microcontroller/ Linduino program. The
term is generally only used when referring to Arduino based programs, as
sketches have several abstractions that remove some of the complexity of a
standard microcontroller(MCU) program. All sketches contains two primary
functions, the setup() and the loop() function. These are in fact the only
functions that are mandatory in a sketch and are almost always implemented in
some form in a typical MCU program. The setup() function is run once at power on
or after the MCU is reset. The setup() function generally is used to initialize
the MCU peripheral circuits and to initialize all of the control variables. The
loop() function is similar to a main() function that has implemented an infinite
loop inside a standard C program. The code within the loop() function is
typically where the primary program code is placed. The code within the loop()
function will repeat infinitely.

Sketch Modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sketches can be modified to a set of applications specific requirements. All sketches are written such that the most common modifications can be made by changing the variables listed in the /\*Setup Variables \*/ table at the top of the sketch. For reference, example modifications to a DC2259 (LTC6811) sketch are shown below. These modifications are applicable to most of the available BMS ICs in the sketchbook.

Common modifications can be made by changing the Setup Variables. The most
common application changes are listed below. After the variables are changed,
the sketch will need to be recompiled and uploaded to the Linduino.

1. To change the number of ICs in the isoSPI network, change the TOTAL_IC
   variable. A number between 1 and 4 should be entered. In an application that
   has 2 devices in the network the modified line will look like:

::

   const uint8_t TOTAL_IC = 2;

2. Often an application may need to sample data at a rate faster than the
   default 500ms (2Hz). To modify the loop/ sample rate the
   MEASUREMENT_LOOP_TIME variable should be changed. The loop time must be
   entered in milliseconds and should be a number larger than 20ms. To change
   the loop rate to roughly 10 measurements a second the loop rate should be
   changed to 100mS. The modified line will look like:

::

   const uint16_t MEASUREMENT_LOOP_TIME = 100;

3. It is possible to modify which measurements fall within the loop during the
   Loop Measurements command. The following list are the measurements that can
   be looped:

::

   const uint8_t MEASURE_CELL = ENABLED; // This is ENABLED or DISABLED
   const uint8_t MEASURE_AUX = DISABLED; // This is ENABLED or DISABLED
   const uint8_t MEASURE_STAT = DISABLED; //This is ENABLED or DISABLED

By default only a cell measurement is done, as noted by MEASURE_CELL = ENABLED.
What measurements are made can be changed by setting what the Measure field is
equal to. To Measure Cells and the Status register but not the AUX register, the
variables would be setup as shown below:

::

   const uint8_t MEASURE_CELL = ENABLED; // This is ENABLED or DISABLED
   const uint8_t MEASURE_AUX = DISABLED; // This is ENABLED or DISABLED
   const uint8_t MEASURE_STAT = ENABLED; //This is ENABLED or DISABLED

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4. ADC conversion settings can also be modified in the Setup Variables section.
   The default setup is to run the ADC in ‘Normal’ mode, which has a 7kHz filter
   code; in this mode the ADC_OPT bit is Disabled. Typical choice for which cell
   to convert is ALL. Full ADC conversion programming requires setting ADC_OPT,

ADC_CONVERSION_MODE, CELL_CH_TO_CONVERT, AUX_CH_TO_CONVERT and
STAT_CH_TO_CONVERT. These variables are programmed with constants listed in the
LTC68xy_daisy.h file. For simplicity they are also listed below:

::

   MD_422HZ_1KHZ
   MD_27KHZ_14KHZ
   MD_7KHZ_3KHZ
   MD_26HZ_2KHZ
   ADC_OPT_ENABLED
   ADC_OPT_DISABLED
   CELL_CH_ALL
   CELL_CH_1and7
   CELL_CH_2and8
   CELL_CH_3and9
   CELL_CH_4and10
   CELL_CH_5and11
   CELL_CH_6and12

To set the ADC to have a 1kHz filter corner the ADC_OPT and ADC_CONVERSION_MODE
variables would be changed to:

::

   ADC_OPT = ADC_OPT_ENABLED;
   ADC_CONVERSION_MODE = MD_422HZ_1KHZ;

To convert only cells 2 and 8,

::

   CELL_CH_TO_CONVERT = CELL_CH_2and8;

5. In another example, the user may want to change the undervoltage and
   overvoltage thresholds. Each number is based on an LSB of 100µV.

::

   //Under Voltage and Over Voltage Thresholds
   const uint16_t OV_THRESHOLD = 41000;
   // Over voltage threshold ADC Code. LSB = 0.0001
   const uint16_t UV_THRESHOLD = 30000;
   // Under voltage threshold ADC Code. LSB = 0.0001
