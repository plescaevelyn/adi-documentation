ADS9-V2EBZ HIGH SPEED CARRIER CARD
==================================

Preface
-------

The :adi:`ADS9-V2EBZ <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADS9-V2EBZ.html>` Carrier Card was developed to support the evaluation of Analog Devices High Speed Data Converters with serial line rates up to 28Gbps. This Wiki site provides a high level overview of the platform. The ADS9-V2 is intended to be used only with specified Analog Devices Evaluation Boards. The ADS9-V2 is not intended to be used as a general purpose development platform, and no support is available for standalone operation. The ADS9-V2 may contain hardware features that are not fully productized or supported by our default customer evaluation configurations. Please refer to Xilinx and its approved distributors for general purpose FPGA Development Kits if needed.

Using the ADS9-V2EBZ to evaluate High Speed Converters
======================================================

Overview
--------

When connected to a specified Analog Devices high speed converter evaluation
board, the ADS9-V2EBZ works as a data generation and acquisition board. Designed
to support the highest speed JESD204B/C converters, the FPGA on the ADS9-V2EBZ
acts as the data and control interface. A typical test setup is shown below.
