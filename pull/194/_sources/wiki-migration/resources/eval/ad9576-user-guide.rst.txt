GENERAL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

The AD9576 evaluation board is a compact, easy-to-use platform for evaluating all features of the :adi:`AD9576` dual channel, power-on ready clock generator. The :adi:`AD9576` provides a multi-output clock generator function, along with two on-chip phase-locked loop cores, PLL0 and PLL1, optimized for asynchronous clocking applications. The PLLs are fully configurable via serial port control as well as configurable via pin-programmable ready, PPR, pins to select between numerous power on ready configurations.

The :adi:`AD9576` can output up to 11 differential clock signals driven by a mix of a high performance PLL, general purpose PLL, and buffered reference input. 11 total outputs and 3 reference inputs are accessible on the evaluation board. The output differential transmission line pairs use 50Ω single ended characteristic impedance and are connected to standard edge launch SMA connectors. The AD9576/PCBZ has a fully configurable power supply to allow the user to evaluate the AD9576 while being powered directly by a step down switching regulator or external LDOs. The :adi:`AD9576` evaluation board uses RoHS-compliant FR-4 material. For convenience, detailed information from the :adi:`AD9576 data sheet <static/imported-files/data_sheets/AD9576.pdf>` has been included here. Use this user guide in conjunction with the :adi:`AD9576 data sheet <static/imported-files/data_sheets/AD9576.pdf>` available at www.analog.com.

Reference Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9576 evaluation has 3 reference inputs sources. The physical connection of each source is configurable between an on board XTAL, and on board XO, and an external reference input via SMA connector by configuring a set of 3 jumpers specific to the individual reference. **Table 2** shows the jumper setting to configure the REF0 input connections.

**Table 2. REF0 Configuration Jumper Settings**

================= =========== ================= =================
REF0 Input Source Settings                      
================= =========== ================= =================

P208         P210                    P212
============ ======================= ======================

**Please note:** Each AD9576 input receiver should be configured appropriately for signal applied. Please see the Reference Input section and Table 32 of the :adi:`AD9576 data sheet <static/imported-files/data_sheets/AD9576.pdf>` for more information on this subject.

Serial Port Configuration Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The logic state of the AD9576 serial port configuration pins, SP0 and SP1, are read upon exit from a reset state and determine the protocol of the serial port as well as if a PPR load will be executed. P102 and P103 are connected to SP0 and SP1 respectively and **Table 4** shows the effect of P102 and P103 states at release from a reset state.

**Table 4. Serial Port configuration**

+-------------------+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+-----------+

PPRx Pins
~~~~~~~~~

The AD9576 uses pin strapping to select among a multitude of power-on ready
configurations for its 11 output clocks, which require only the connection of
external pull-up or pull-down resistors to the appropriate pin program reader
pins (PPRx). These pins configure the internal registers for establishing the
desired frequency translations, clock output functionality, and input reference
functionality.

Each PPR pin can be individually configured between all applicable impedance and terminus values by configuring a set of 3 jumpers specific to the individual reference. **Table 5** shows the jumper setting to configure the REF0 input connections.

**Table 5. PPR0 State Jumper Settings**

========== ================ ================ ===============
PPR0 State Settings

========== ================ ================ ===============

| PPR1, PPR2, and PPR3 may be configured in the same manner, but with jumper equivalencies shown in **Table 6**.

**Table 6. PPRx State Jumper Equivalency**

+-------------+------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
| PPR0 Jumper | Equivalent PPR1 Jumper | Equivalent PPR2 Jumper | Equivalent PPR3 Jumper |
+=============+========================+========================+========================+

+-------------+------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

Used in conjunction with the PPR tables (Table 31 - Table 34) in the :adi:`AD9576 data sheet <media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD9576.pdf>`, these pins allow the user to set the AD9576 to a multitude of power on ready configurations provided the serial port configuration pins are configured to allow a PPR load.

**Please note:** The AD9576 input receivers physical connections should be configured to match the reference input format configured by PPR0 and the AD9576 outputs should be terminated to match the output logic formats determined by PPR1, PPR2, and PPR3.

RESETB Push Button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The blue RESETB push button, S100, is located in the lower left quadrant of the board. When this button is depressed, the AD9576 is held in a chip level reset state. This push button may be used to reconfigure the logic levels read by the AD9576 for the serial port configuration pins and PPRx pins. **Please note:** This push button is a board level operation and the evaluation software is unaware of its operation. Therefore, using this push button will desynchronize the state of the AD9576 with the state of the evaluation board software. To re-establish synchronization, one must press the **READ ALL** button in the AD9576 Chip View window.

EVALUATION BOARD SOFTWARE

The AD9576 evaluation software allows the user to control the full functionality of the AD9576 through SPI communication with the evaluation board. The AD9576 evaluation software is implemented as a component plug-in in ADI’s :doc:`Analysis \| Control \| Evaluation (ACE) Software </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/ace>` desktop software. ACE allows the evaluation of control of multiple evaluation systems from across ADI’s product portfolio and is designed to educate the user in the functional operation of the component. The :doc:`ACE wiki page </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/ace>` contains system requirement and prerequisite information as well as links to the most recent installer and user guide. The ACE user guide contains detailed information concerning all current aspects of the ACE environment. Much of that information will not be described in this document, but some main ACE operational points relevant to component level functionality will be described. It is highly recommended to review the ACE user guide to discover the myriad capabilities and offerings the ACE environment provides to the user.

Software Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following instructions to set up the AD9576 evaluation board software.
Do not connect the evaluation board until the software installation is complete.

-  Download the AD9576 driver installer, **ADI_LRF_CYUSBdriver.exe**, from the AD9576 Evaluation product page.
-  Run the installer and follow the prompts through completion.
-  Download the :adi:`ACE software installer <ace>`. Any ACE version greater than 1.25 supports the AD9576 plugin. Older ACE version 1.10.2671.1118 also supports the plugin: `Analysis \| Control \| Evaluation (ACE) Software Version 1.10.2671.1118 <https://swdownloads.analog.com/ACE/ACEInstall_1.10.2671.1118.exe>`_
-  Follow the section 2.1, installation guide, of the ACE User Guide to
   completion.

General Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Power up and connect the evaluation board to the PC. Open the ACE software. After opening ACE, the user will be presented with the Start View shown in **Figure 2**. The Explore Local Plug-ins section shows all plug-ins that are locally installed and allows the user to operate the plug-in without the presence of the associated evaluation platform. The Attached Hardware section shows all ADI evaluation platforms which are found to be connected to the PC. The appearance of an Unknown Hardware plug-in means that the plug-in for a detected ADI evaluation platform is not locally installed. Double click on any of the shown plug-ins will open the associated plug-in and navigate to its default view, which is the board view for the AD9576. Note: opening a plug-in from the Explore Local Plug-ins section will not automatically establish a connection with the associated evaluation platform even if the hardware is connected. Only opening a plug-in from the Attached hardware section will automatically establish this connection.

   |image2| **Figure 2. ACE Start Screen**

Board View
~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9576 board view can be seen in **Figure 3**. As the AD9576 evaluation platform is for a single component, the board view has only three main portions, each circled and numbered in **Figure 3**:

-  View toolbar
-  AD9576 primaray component link
-  PPR pin state jumper truth table

.. container:: centeralign

   |image3| **Figure 3. AD9576 ACE Plug-in Board View**

The board view toolbar provided three board level functions and a detailed description may be found in section 3.6.3 of the ACE user guide. The AD9576 primary component link allows the user to navigate to the AD9576 chip view, shown in **Figure 4**, by double clicking this link. The chip view is the primary conduit through which the user can interface with the AD9576. The PPR pin state jumper truth table shows the user the jumper configuration to place a given PPR pin into a PPR state. Used in conjunction with the PPR tables (Table 31 - Table 34) in the :adi:`AD9576 data sheet <static/imported-files/data_sheets/AD9576.pdf>`, the user can set the AD9576 to a multitude of power on ready configurations. Please note that the SP0 and SP1 jumpers must be configured to allow a PPR load.

Chip View
~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: centeralign

   |image4| **Figure 4. AD9576 ACE Plug-in Chip View**

The chip view is the primary interface used to configure the AD9576. It consists
primarily of an interactive block diagram which shows the configuration of the
device, calculates the frequency translation, implements frequency based error
checking, and allows the user to intuitively configure the AD9576 parameters. It
should be noted that in order to synchronize the register content of the
software with that of the AD9576 after a PPR load, the user must press the ‘Read
All’ button in the chip view toolbar in the upper left hand portion of the
window.

Block Interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A detailed explanation of the interaction with the block diagram is explained in the `ACE User Guide <http://swdownloads.analog.com/ACE/ACE_User_Manual_rev3.pdf>`_ sections 3.7.1 through 3.7.3. However, it should be noted that the AD9576 chip view heavily leverages the use of configuration menus for blocks with multiple associated bit fields. Clicking on such a block will pop up a menu as pictured in **Figure 5**.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image5| **Figure 5. Divider Q3 configuration menu**

Clicking and dragging the title bar of the menu will allow the user to relocate
the menu at one’s convenience. In order to close the menu, the user may close
the ‘close’ button or simply click away from the menu.

Frequency Translation Calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The frequency translation of the AD9576 is calculated from reference input frequency to output clock frequency based on the state of the intermediate blocks in between. Not every block in the block diagram impacts the frequency translation, but those that do contain a tool tip displaying the input and output frequencies associated with said block as illustrated in **Figure 6**.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image6| **Figure 6. Frequency display tool tip.**

Changing the configuration of a block that affects the frequency translation will produce an automatic calculation and error checking to inform the user of the impact the change has had on the operation of the AD9576. Any errors resulting from the error checking functionality will display visually as well as the Events Tool View. This view gives the user additional detail regarding the nature of the error and is explained in detail in the `ACE User Guide <http://swdownloads.analog.com/ACE/ACE_User_Manual_rev3.pdf>`_, section 3.9.3.

Memory Map View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9576 ACE plug-in as contains a detailed view of the entire register map in either register or bit field based format, known as the Memory Map shown in **Figure 7**. This view may be accessed by clicking the ‘Proceed to Memory Map’ button in the lower right hand corner of the chip view.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image7| **Figure 7. AD9576 ACE Plug-in Memory Map View.**

The memory map view is explained in detail in the `ACE User Guide <http://swdownloads.analog.com/ACE/ACE_User_Manual_rev3.pdf>`_ section 3.8, but one of the more useful features in the functional group filter shown in the left portion of **Figure 7**. The AD9576 bit fields have been grouped by relevant functionality and the functional group filter allows the user to quickly and easily switch between viewing only bit fields or registers contained within these macro level functional groups.

Sessions
~~~~~~~~

The ACE application has the ability to save and recall a given configuration of the software including all currently open plug-ins. These ‘states’ are referred to as ‘sessions’. The File selection in the application toolbar contains options to create, open, save, or close sessions, as shown in **Figure 8**.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image8| **Figure 8. ACE File Menu.**

The left hand section of the Start View also exposes the ability to create and
open sessions as well as maintaining a list of recent sessions that may be
directly opened.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Though the AD9576 supports I :sup:`2`\ C communication, currently the ACE application does not support the usage of the I :sup:`2`\ C portion of the AD9576 drivers.
-  Currently, the ACE AD9576 plug-in does not support the control or read back
   of the AD9576 evaluation board GPIO pins.
