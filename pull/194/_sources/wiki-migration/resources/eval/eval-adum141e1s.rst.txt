EVALUATING THE ADUM141E1S QUAD CHANNEL ISOLATOR
===============================================

Preface
-------

The :adi:`EVAL-ADUM141E1S` supports the ADUM141E1S quad-channel digital isolator based on Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler® technology. Combining high speed CMOS and monolithic air core transformer technology, the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` provideds outstanding performance characteristics superior to alternatives such as optocoupler devices and other integrated couplers. The :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` offers low propagation delay and low pulse width distortion as well a tight channel matching. The :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` features two different fail-safe options by which the outputs transition to a pre-determined state when the input power supply is not applied or the inputs are disabled.

Complete specifications for the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` are provided in the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` data sheet available from Analog Devices, Inc., and should be consulted in conjunction with this Wiki user guide when using the evaluation board.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` board, shown in Figure 1, can be used to evaluate the performance and data sheet specifications of the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>`. Figure 2 shows the schematic of the :adi:`EVAL-ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` circuit which can be used to test the accuracy of the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` and perform other tests. The :adi:`EVAL-ADUM141E1S` is a 4-layer PC board, complete with ground and power layers as shown in the Evaluation Board Schematics and Artwork section.

Figure 2 shows the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` schematic of the :adi:`EVAL-ADUM141E1S` evaluation board. U1 is the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` in the center of the board and Pin 1 is the top-left pad with respect to the notch in the silkscreen’s package outline.

Equipment Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Agilent B1110A Pulse generator or equivalent (capable of supplying 75 MHz square wave with at leave 4 V amplitude and 50% duty cycle
-  MSOX6004A Keysight Oscilloscope (1 GHz - 6 GHz, 20 GSa/s) with N2796 active probe (2 GHz BW, 1 MΩ, <1 pF) or equivalent
-  Keysight (Agilent) E3631A Triple Output Power Supply or equivalent
-  SMA to BNC coaxial cable
-  50Ω SMD resistors
-  15 pF capacitors
-  Cables for power supply connections

Power Input
~~~~~~~~~~~

Each side of the :adi:`ADUM141E1S <ADuM141ES>` requires an off-board power source. The power source must be independent if common-mode voltages are applied across the isolation barrier or damage may occure to the power supply.

Example Test Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Install the 50Ω input resistors (R6 and R16).
-  Install the 15 pF load capacitors (C8, C9, C10, and C11).
-  Connect the evaluation board to the test equipment. See Figure 2 below. Note: Make sure the pulse generator and power supply outputs are disabled.

-  Once the connections have been made in Step 3 (Figure 2) set both output of the power supply to 5V. Enable the outputs.
-  Configure the pulse generator to produce a 0V – 5V step, 75MHz Square Wave with an offset value of 2.5V. (If using the Agilent B1110A the max amplitude at 75MHz will be 4 V) Enable the pulse generator output. Note: This provides an input to the A Channel (VIA, J1) of the evaluation board.
-  Set the oscilloscope to the following settings: CH1 = 750 mV/div, Time Base = 2 ns/div.
-  Select the following measurements for CH1: Amplitude, Rise Time, Fall Time, and Frequency.
-  Use the N2796A active probe to capture the A Channel Output (VOA) at connector J5 (a 75 MHz square with an amplitude of approximately 5 V should be visible). An example plot is shown below in Figure 3.

-  Check the supply current on both outputs of the power supply to ensure that IDD1 and IDD2 does not exceed 25 mA.
-  Repeat steps 6 and 7 for any of the remaining channels desired for test (B, C and/or D) by connecting the pulse generator to the appropriate input channel and the oscilloscope to its corresponding output. Refer to the table below for connections:
