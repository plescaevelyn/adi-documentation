DPG2
====

The Data Pattern Generator is a bench-top instrument for driving vectors into
Analog Devices' high-speed Digital-to-Analog converters. The DPG connects to a
PC over USB, and allows a user to download a vector from their PC into the DPG’s
internal memory. Once downloaded, the vector can be played out to an attached
Evaluation Board for a specific DAC at full speed. This allows for rapid
evaluation of the DAC with both generic and customer-generated test data.

**Please note:** Analog Devices' pattern generators and high-speed DAC evaluation boards are designed and sold solely to support an efficient and thorough means by which to evaluate Analog Devices high speed DACs in a lab environment for a wide range of end applications. Any application or use of the pattern generators and/or high-speed DAC evaluation boards, other than specified above, will not be supported.*

The DPG2 has been replaced by the :doc:`DPG3 </wiki-migration/resources/eval/dpg/dpg3>`. For information on the software used to control the DPG2 and DPG3, see the :doc:`High-Speed DAC Software Suite </wiki-migration/resources/eval/dpg/dacsoftwaresuite>` page.

Output Data
===========

The DPG2 has two 16-bit ports capable of interfacing with both LVDS and LVCMOS
devices. When transmitting a data vector each sample from the data file is
played sequentially on the output port. Note that while the two data ports are
labeled "I" and "Q" in the pinout, the actual mapping of bits to DACs will
depend on the particular evaluation board connected. Many DACs with interfaces
of 16-bits or less will only use a single port (generally the "I" port).

For LVCMOS/LVTTL devices, 3.3V, 2.5V, and 1.8V levels are supported.

The vector length must be at least 256 points per channel, and the length must
be divisible by 256 for proper operation.

Clocking
========

The DPG requires an input clock to set the frequency of the data output. This is
labeled DCO, for Data Clock Out. In LVDS mode, this clock is supplied through
the main connector, and no other cables are required. In CMOS mode, the clock
can either come through the main connector, or can be supplied via the SMA jacks
J12 and J13. Which method is available will depend on the design of the
evaluation board. When selecting a configuration, the names ending in (DCO) will
have the clock received through the main connector. Configuration names ending
in (SMA) will expect a clock to be cabled into J12 or J13.

The DPG also provides an output clock, *DCI*, which is synchronous with the data leaving the DPG2.

Hexadecimal Display
===================

Each DPG2 is equipped with a small red display. When a DPG2 is powered up, but
not yet connected to software, the display will read 0. Once software has
initiated communication with the DPG2, the display will indicate the index of
the DPG2. This is used when multiple DPG2s are connected to the same PC.

The left "decimal point" on the display indicates if the DPG2 has been
"configured". If the left point is not lit, the DPG2 will need to be configured
before any other operations.

The right decimal point indicates the status of the vector. The point will not
be lit if a vector has not been downloaded into the DPG2. The point will stay
lit when a vector is downloaded but not playing, and the point will blink when
the vector is being played to the DUT.

SMA Jacks
=========

There are two SMA jacks location on the DPG2 (J12 and J13). These are an
optional input clock path for use with older CMOS interface DAC evaluation
boards.

Multi-Unit Synchronization
==========================

Up to four DPG2's can be synchronized together so that the LVDS data coming out
of all the DPGs is aligned to a common clock. Synchronization is not supported
with the CMOS interface.

A clock distribution module (Part Number HSC-DAC-DPG-CLKDIS) is required, as well as one Samtec HQCD-030-15.00-TED-TEU-1 cable per DPG2, for synchronizing. When ordering the distribution module, please indicate how many cables are needed. A schematic of the clock distribution board is available `here <https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/eval/dpg/dpg2_multisync_schematic.pdf>`_.

The synchronization system works by having the Master unit forward the clock it
receives (from the evaluation board attached to the Master) on to the Clock
Distribution Module. The module then sends this clock back out to each unit,
including the Master. The trace lengths and cables are all very well matched,
and ensure that the clocks arrive at each slave DPG2 at the same time. The DPG2s
then use this clock, instead of the clock from their respective evaluation
board, to clock the data.

This requires that all the evaluation boards be clocked with exactly the same
clock, as any frequency drifts between the evaluation boards will not be seen in
the data, leading to data overrun or underrun.

Setting up Multi-Unit Synchronization
-------------------------------------

1. Connect the sync cables between the DPGs (up near the main data connector)
   and the sync board. Power the sync board with +5V. Make sure one of the
   DPG2’s is connected to the “Master” connector on the sync board, the other
   units can be connected to any of the other outputs on the sync board.

2. Connect a DAC board up to each DPG2 as you normally would, except only
   connect one of the DAC eval board to USB. Power up the eval boards.

3. Configure the DAC eval board as you would like with the SPI program. Then
   disconnect the USB, and connect it to the next eval board, configure it, and
   so on until all eval boards are setup.

4. With all the DPG2s powered on and connected to USB, open DPGDownloader. It
   should see all the DGP2s, and have a separate “panel” for each. On the left
   side of each panel, there is an option that defaults to “Single”. On the
   Master DPG2, change this to Master, and on the others change it to Slave.

5. Import or create the vectors you want the DACs to play out, and assign them
   to each DAC. You can correlate each DAC in the software with the number
   displayed in red on the DPG2 itself.

6. Download the vectors to all the DPG2s. Hit play on all the units except the
   Master. This arms the slaves to be ready to transmit.

7. Hit Play on the Master unit. This starts playback on all the units.
