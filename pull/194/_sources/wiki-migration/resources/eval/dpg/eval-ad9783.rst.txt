EVALUATING THE AD9780/AD9781/AD9783 DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTERS
================================================================

Preface
-------

This user guide describes both the hardware and software setup needed to acquire data capture from :adi:`AD9783-DPG2-EBZ <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9783.html#eb-relatedhardware>` evaluation board to characterize :adi:`AD9780`/:adi:`AD9781`/:adi:`AD9783` 12-/14-/16- bit 500MSPS high-speed digital-to-analog converter

This guide shows how AD9783-DPG2-EBZ works with ADS7-V2/SDP-H1 controller boards developed by Analog Devices. Link to the old user guide document is provided for customers who still have DPG2 and DPG3 controller boards.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

-  Attach :adi:`AD9783-DPG2-EBZ <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9783.html#eb-relatedhardware>` to controller board's (SDP-H1/ADS7-V2) FMC connector using the AD-DAC-FMC-ADP adapter board.
-  Connect the controller board (SDP-H1/ADS7-V2) to PC via USB and to a **12V power supply**.
-  Connect the evaluation board to PC via USB and to a **5Vdc 1A power supply** on **P5** and **P6**. Refer to Figures 1a and 1b.
-  Connect continuous wave generator for clock input to **SMA J1** and DAC output from **SMA J5 (IOUT1P)** or **SMA J9 (IOUT2P)** to a signal/spectrum analyzer.
-  Set clock input to **200MHz**, **3dBm**.
-  Open ACE. The board will be automatically recognized by the software. Click the plugin. Otherwise, install the :adi:`ACE plugin <plugins/ace/Board.AD9783.1.2019.43200.acezip>` for AD9783.

-  The default values for the register is displayed and set. The values can be changed on the Chip View GUI, or on the **Memory Map** for registers not available in the GUI. For more info on the memory map, refer to :adi:`AD978x <static/imported-files/data_sheets/AD9780_9781_9783.pdf>` datasheet. Once the desired values are set, Click **Apply Changes** and then **Read All** on the upper right window.

-  In DPG Downloader Lite, from the "Add Generator Waveforms" pulldown menu select **Single Tone** and apply the settings as shown in Figures 5a and 5b. Set the **Data Rate** to 200MHz and **Desired Frequency** to 16MHz. Set **DAC Resolution** to 16 for AD9783, 14 for AD9781, and 12 for AD9780. Uncheck the "Unsigned Data" box and Check the **Generate Complex Data (I & Q)**.
-  Select the I/Q tone from the **I/Q Data Vector** pulldown menu.
-  Press the download arrow and then the play button. The spectrum similar to Figure 6 should appear in the signal/spectrum analyzer.

Using the ADL5375 Modulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, solder jumpers JP4, JP5, JP6, and JP7 are configured to route the DAC outputs to SMA J5 (IOUT1P) and to J9 (IOUT2P). This jumper setting is shown on Figure 7a. To connect the DAC output to the filter that feeds into the ADL5375, the solder jumpers should be reconfigured as shown in Figure 7b. Source the desired LO of the modulator (i.e. 900 or 1800MHz, 3dBm) on SMA J2 (LO IN). The ADL5375 Modulator output can be observed on SMA J6 (RF OUT).

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section lists items to check and practices to use when debugging any unexpected performance of a board. If unexpected results occur:

-  Check the voltage rails of the evaluation board. P5 and P6 should be 5V; TP3, TP5, and TP7 should be 3.3V; TP9 and TP11 should be 1.8V.
-  Check if all (3) blue LEDs on the AD-DAC-FMC-ADP board is lit up. Reconnect the board to the FMC connector of the controller board (SDP-H1/ADS7-V2) if not lit up.
-  Check if controller board (SDP-H1/ADS7-V2) is being supplied properly by 12Vdc adapter. Some LEDs on the controller board should lit up.
-  Perform a chip reset by pressing S2 on the AD9783 evaluation board.
-  Power cycle both the controller board (SDP-H1/ADS7-V2) and the AD9783 evaluation board.
-  Probe C18 and C19 to make sure a clock signal is being sent into the DAC.
-  Check if XD1 is lit up on the evaluation board. Reconnect/replace the USB cable connection to the evaluation board if it's not lit up.
-  Disconnect and reconnect the controller board (SDP-H1/ADS7-V2) and AD9783 evaluation board. Reopen ACE and DPG Lite software.
