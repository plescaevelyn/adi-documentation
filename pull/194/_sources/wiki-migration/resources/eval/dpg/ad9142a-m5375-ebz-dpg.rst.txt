Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9142A-M5375-EBZ connects to a DPG for quick evaluation of the AD9142A, a
high-speed, signal processing Digital to Analog Converter. The DPG automatically
formats the data and sends it to the AD9142A-M5375-EBZ, simplifying evaluation
of the device. The Evaluation Board (EVB) runs from a +5V supply. A clock
distribution chip AD9516 is included on this EVB as a clock fan-out and
frequency divider for the DACCLK, REFCLK and DPG input clock. Also included is a
quadrature modulator ADL5375 for quick DAC+IQMOD evaluation. Figure 2 is an
image of the top side of the AD9142A-M5375-EBZ.

AD9142A Evaluation Software
---------------------------

The AD9142A Evaluation Board software has an easy-to-use legacy graphical user interface (GUI), but ACE, a newer evaluation software from ADI, is the preferred evaluation software. Both are included on the Evaluation Board CD. Alternatively, DPGDownloader can be downloaded from the DPG website at http://www.analog.com/dpg. This will install DPGDownloader (for generating and loading vectors into the DPG) and AD9142A SPI software. ACE can be downloaded from the ACE website at https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/ace. The ACE plug-in for the evaluation board is available for download on the AD9142A eval webpage in the software section at http://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9142A.html#eb-relatedsoftware.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Connect +5.0V to P5, GND to P6. One low phase noise high frequency clock source
should be connected to the SMA connector, J1 (AD9516_CLKIN). The other low phase
noise high frequency clock source should be connected to the SMA connector, J15
(LO_IN), and the spectrum analyzer should be connected to the SMA connector, J6.
The evaluation board connects to the DPG through the connectors P1 and P2. The
PC should be connected to the EVB using the mini-USB connector XP2 after
installation of the Evaluation Board software. Figure 1 shows the block diagram
of the set-up.

SPI SOFTWARE
------------

The AD9142A SPI software is conveniently organized in a series of tabs that
groups registers according to their functions. In this way, all registers
associated with the digital functions, for example, are on the “Digital
Functions” tab. All registers associated with the PLL are on the “PLL” tab, and
so on. Normally the “Quick Start” tab is sufficient for a quick evaluation. The
most frequently used register controls are included on this tab. A full
description of each register and its settings is given in the AD9142A data
sheet. Some of the registers and their functions are described here as they
pertain to the AD9142A evaluation board. Please note that some of the screen
images in this document may not match exactly with the latest revision of the
software, due to ongoing improvements and enhancements to the software. The full
screen layout is shown in Figure 5. The tabs can be seen across the top of the
work area, and four function buttons in the menu area. “Save Registers to File”
and “Restore Registers from File” allow the user to save the current register
settings into a file for later uses. A register is immediately updated when the
value in the control is changed. Switching between tabs does not update register
values. “Read All Registers” can be used to monitor a resister with changing
readback values. “ Record Sequence” allows the user to record a series of SPI
writes in a particular order and to play back the sequence later. A short
description of the register is shown in the status bar on the bottom of the work
area when the mouse curser hovers over the control. Some of the tabs are
discussed below.

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

The “Quick Start” tab has selections that apply to the general configuration of
the DAC. Reset DAC is recommended every time when the DAC is powered on or
reset. Interpolation Rate allows the user to select among the 3 interpolation
modes (2X, 4X, and 8X). When the NCO is used, set NCO Enable to 1, fill in the
NCO frequency tuning word with the desired value and toggle SPI Update Request.
To use the Fs/4 modulation, turn on the Fs/4 Modulation control. FIFO SPI Reset
Request sets the FIFO with the requested value through a SPI command. The FIFO
Level Read Back should reflect the actual FIFO level after the FIFO SPI Reset
Request. Note loading/reloading a vector in the DPG Downloader may generate
glitches on the DCI so it is also recommended to toggle the FIFO SPI RESET
REQUEST to ensure the FIFO level stays optimal. DCI Clk Div Ratio changes the
divide ratio of the AD9516 input clock frequency over DCI frequency. In word
mode, this ratio should be the same as the interpolation rate. In byte mode, it
should be half of the interpolation rate. For example, if the interpolation
ratio is 4x, the DCI divide ratio should be 2x. Unlike the AD9142A, the AD9516
registers in this SPI software are not immediately updated after a user changes
the value in a control. AD9516 Update loads the changes in the AD9516 settings.

   +----------------------------------------+
   

PLL
~~~

The “PLL” tab includes all the PLL control registers. The recommended settings
for the best performance is PLL Charge Pump Current = 7 and PLL LOOP BW = 7. The
user needs to follow the sequence below to enable the PLL. 1. Choose the desired
divide ratios in the Loop Divider and the VCO Divider. 2. Set PLL Charge Pump
Current and PLL Loop BW settings to 7. 3. Set the PLL Mode to Manual. 4. Turn on
PLL Enable. 5. Set the PLL Mode to Auto.

EVB Jumper Configurations
-------------------------

This evaluation board allows evaluation of both the DAC IF outputs as well as
the modulator RF outputs. By default, the solder jumpers are configured to look
at the modulator RF outputs. Below is a table listing the jumper configurations
and SMA connector connections needed to view either output on a spectrum
analyzer.

.. container:: center

   
   +-------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | Output Viewed     | SMA Connector     | Jumper Configurations                    |
   +===================+===================+==========================================+
   | I DAC Output      | J3("DAC1 Output") | JP4 & JP5 Pins 1-2 (outer pads)          |
   +-------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | Q DAC Output      | J4("DAC2 Output") | JP6 & JP7 Pins 1-2 (outer pads)          |
   +-------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | ADL5375 RF Output | J6("MOD_OUT")     | JP4, JP5, JP6, JP7 Pins 2-3 (inner pads) |
   +-------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
   

Note: When viewing the modulator output, a local oscillator (LO) must be
connected to J15 (”LO_IN”) to properly modulate the signals

ACE Software
------------

The ACE software is organized to allow the user to evaluate and control the
AD9122A evaluation board. The “Initial Configuration” wizard, which is only
available for certain boards, controls the DAC and PLL setups. Block diagram
views of the board and chip contain elements that can be used to vary parameters
like ref current and data format. These parameters can be changed using check
boxes, drop down menus, and input boxes. Some parameters do not have settings
shown in the diagram. Double click on the parameter to view the available
settings, seen with the NCO settings below.

|ad9122_nco.png|

   Figure 17. NCO settings for the AD9122

In addition, some parameters can be enabled or disabled. This feature is evident
by the color of the block parameter. For example, if the block parameter is dark
blue, the parameter is enabled. If it is light grey, it is disabled. To enable
or disable a parameter, click on it.

More direct changes to registers and bit fields can be made in the memory map,
which is linked from the chip block diagram through the “Proceed to Memory Map”
button. In this view, names, addresses, and data can be manually altered by the
user.

ACE also contains the Macro Tool, which can be used to record register reads and
writes. This is executed in the memory map view or with the initialization
wizard. To use, check the “Record Sub-Commands” checkbox and press the record
button. Changes in the memory map, which are bolded until they are applied to
the part, are recorded as UI commands by the macro tool once the changes are
made. Changed register write commands for the controls are also recorded. Hit
“Apply Changes” to execute the commands and make changes in the memory map. To
stop recording, click the “Stop Recording” button. A macro tool page with the
command steps will be created. The macro can be saved using the “Save Macro”
button so that it may be loaded for future use.

The raw macro file will be saved using ACE syntax, which is not easily readable.
To remedy this, the ACE software download includes the Macro to Hex Conversion
Tool. The user can choose to include or exclude register write, reads, and/or
comments in the conversion. The file pathways for the source and save paths
should be the same, except that one should be an .acemacro file and the other
should be a .txt file. The “Convert” button converts and opens the converted
text file, which is easier to read. The conversion tool can also convert back to
an .acemacro file if desired.
