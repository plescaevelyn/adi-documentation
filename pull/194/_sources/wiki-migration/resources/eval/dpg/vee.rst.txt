Agilent VEE
===========

Connecting to VEE involves the same commands as used in other applications, using the .NET Operation Builder. Follow these steps to create a basic connection to a DPG and download data. For a complete function reference, see the `programming_reference <https://wiki.analog.com/programming_reference>`_ section.

-  On the *Device* menu, select *.NET Assembly References...* Scroll through the list under *Available References* and select mscorlib. Click the >> button to add mscorlib to the *Selected References* list. Click *Browse...* and browse to the folder where DPGDownloader was installed (typically C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Analog Devices\\DPG\\). Select AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces.dll.\ |image1| Click OK.
-  Select AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces and click >>. Select System.Collections and click >>. |image2| Click OK.
-  Select *Device* > *.NET Operation Builder..*. Expand AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces, then expand AnalogDevices.DPG.PluginFinder and select HardwarePluginFinder.\ |image3| Click OK. Place the object in your work area. Double click in the object where it displays *< Double-Click to Add Operation >*. Select CreateInstance. |image4|\ Click OK. Click OK again on the *Edit "CreateInstance"* screen.
-  Open the *.NET Operation Builder* again. Select *HardwarePluginFinder* again, click OK, and double click in the object again. Select *FindPlugins* from the list, and select OK. Click OK on the *Edit "FindPlugins"* window. Wire the output of the first object *hardwarePluginFinder* to the input of the second object *hardwarePluginFinder*.

-  Open the *.NET Operation Builder* again, this time selecting *mscorlib*, *System*, and then *Array*. Double-click the object where indicated, and select GetValue. Note that there are several GetValues in the list. Select the one that displays *System.Object GetValue(Int32 index)* in the lower box.\ |image5|\ Click OK in the *Edit "GetValue"* box, leaving the *index* set to 0. Connect the *return* output of the previous object to the *array* input of the new object.

-  Open the *.NET Operation Builder*, selecting *AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces*, *AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces*, *IHardwareInterface*. |image6| Double-click the object and select *AttachedDevices* and click Get. Click OK on the *Edit "AttachedDevices"* window. Wire the *return* output of the previous object to the *iHardwareInterface* input of the new object. Create another System.Array block as in step 5 and connect to the output of the object just created.

-  There is now a reference to the first DPG found on the system. From here, the DPG can be configured, loaded with data, and playback started. Open the *.NET Operation Builder*, selecting *AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces*, *AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces*, and *IHardwareDevice*. Double-click the new object, and select *DownloadConfigurationNoReload* and click OK. On the *Edit "DownloadConfigurationNoReload"* screen, enter in the desired configuration name on the *config* line. In this example, *LVDS (DCO)* is used. The correct value will depend on the evaluation board connected to the DPG.
-  Double-click the object again and select *DownloadInterleaveVectorInt1D* and click OK. In the *Edit "DownloadInterleavedVectorInt1D"* window, enter 2 for *channels*, and change *ShowProgress* to True, and click OK. This adds a new input: *data*. The data input is expecting a 1D array of integers. The data is interleaved between the two ports of the DPG. Some parts, for example a dual DAC with a 16-bit interface, will often require interleaving the two channels of the DAC into a single port of the DPG.
-  Double-click the object again and select *PlayMode* and click Set. In the *Edit "PlayMode"* window, press OK to select the default of Loop mode.
-  Double-click the object again and select *StartPlayback* and click OK, and then click OK again.
