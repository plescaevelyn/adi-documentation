EVALUATING THE AD9709/AD9763/AD9765/AD9767 DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER
======================================================================

Preface
-------

This user guide describes both the hardware and software setup needed to acquire data capture from :adi:`AD9767-KIT-EBZ <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9767.html#eb-relatedhardware>` to characterize :adi:`AD9709`/:adi:`AD9763`/:adi:`AD9765`/:adi:`AD9767` dual-port, high speed, 2-channel, 8-/10-/12-/14-bit CMOS DACs.

This guide shows how the AD9767-KIT-EBZ works with SDP-H1 controller board
developed by Analog Devices. Link to the previous user guide document is
provided for customers who still have DPG2 and DPG3 controller boards.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

-  To evaluate performance of lower resolution generics using :adi:`AD9767-EBZ <eval-ad9767>`, disconnect LSBs of :adi:`AD9767` from the data input connector, P1. Refer to Figure 4 in :doc:`Reconfiguring the Evaluation Board </wiki-migration/resources/eval/dpg/eval-ad976x>`.
-  Attach the :adi:`AD9709/63/65/67 Evaluation Board <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9767.html#eb-relatedhardware>` to the SDP-H1 using the adaptor boards and cables. Refer to Figure 1.
-  Supply 3.3Vdc to the evaluation board and 12Vdc to the SDP-H1.
-  Using an SMA T-connector, split the output of a High-Frequency Clock Source (e.g. SMA100A) to SMA J701 on SDP-H1 and to SMA S1 on the evaluation board. Set to 100MHz, 16dBm output.
-  Connect the spectrum analyzer to SMA S6 on the evaluation board.
-  Open DPG Downloader Lite. On the **SDP-H1 Unit 1 Panel**, select **LVCMOS-3.3V** on the Port Configuration. Double check if the **DCO Frequency** detected is 100MHz.
-  Click on the **Add Generator Waveforms** pulldown menu select **Single Tone**. Set the **Data Rate** to 100MHz and **Desired Frequency** to 5MHz. Check the **Unsigned Data** box and the **Generate Complex Data (I & Q)**. Refer to Figure 2.
-  Select 16 bits **DAC Resolution** for all generics (AD9767, AD9765, AD9763, and AD9709).

-  Select the I/Q tone from the **I/Q Data Vector** pulldown menu.
-  Press the **Download** arrow and then the **Play** button. The spectrum similar to Figure 3 should appear in the signal/spectrum analyzer.

=====Reconfiguring the Evaluation Board===== This section details how to configure the :adi:`AD9709/63/65/67 Evaluation Board <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9767.html#eb-relatedhardware>` and allow user to evaluate AD9709, AD9763 and AD9765. Set up the board as shown in figure 4.

-  To evaluate AD9709, Remove RP6 for DAC channel 1 and RP8 for DAC channel 2.
-  To evaluate AD9763, Remove RP6 for DAC channel 1 and RP8 for DAC channel 2 and add 2 22ohm resistors.
-  To evaluate AD9765, Remove RP6 for DAC channel 1 and RP8 for DAC channel 2
   and add 4 22ohm resistors.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section lists items to check and practices to use when debugging any
unexpected performance of a board. If unexpected results occur:

-  Check the supply voltage of the evaluation board. Voltage rail should be 3.3V.
-  Check if all (3) blue LEDs on the AD-DAC-FMC-ADP board is lit up. Reconnect the board to the FMC connector of SDP-H1 if not lit up.
-  Check if the SDP-H1 is being supplied properly by 12Vdc adaptor. Some LEDs on the SDP-H1 should lit up.
-  Power cycle both the SDP-H1 and the AD9709/6x evaluation board.
-  Check on the Spectrum Analyzer if the DAC clock inputs are properly driven. For 100MHz clock, the spectrum analyzer should detect a weak signal at 100MHz. If not detected, check properly the clock source and connections.
-  Disconnect and reconnect the SDP-H1 and AD9709/6x evaluation board. Reopen
   DPG Lite software.
