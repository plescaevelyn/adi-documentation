Introduction
------------

The AD9154-EBZ connects to a DPG3. The AD9154 is a quad JESD204B signal
processing RF Digital to Analog Converter. The DPG3 automatically formats the
data and sends it to the AD9154-EBZ via its JESD204B lanes. The Evaluation Board
(EVB) runs from a single +5V lab supply. A clock distribution chip AD9516 is
included on this EVB as a clock fan-out and frequency divider for the DACCLK,
JESD204B SYSREF signals, and a CFRAME clock used by the DPG3.

AD9154 Evaluation Software
--------------------------

There are two evaluation softwares available for the AD9154: ACE, the preferred evaluation software from ADI, and the legacy SPIPro graphical user interface (GUI). Both are included on the Evaluation Board CD. ACE can also be downloaded from the ACE website at https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/ace. In addition, the ACE plugin for the AD9154 is available in the software section of the :adi:`EVAL-AD9154` eval webpage. DPGDownloader is used with both evaluation softwares and can be downloaded from the DPG website at http://www.analog.com/dpg.

ACE Software Features
---------------------

The ACE software is organized to allow the user to evaluate and control the
AD9122A evaluation board. The “Initial Configuration” wizard, which is only
available for certain boards, controls the DAC and PLL setups. Block diagram
views of the board and chip contain elements that can be used to vary parameters
like ref current and data format. These parameters can be changed using check
boxes, drop down menus, and input boxes. Some parameters do not have settings
shown in the diagram. Double click on the parameter to view the available
settings, seen with the NCO settings below.

In addition, some parameters can be enabled or disabled. This feature is evident
by the color of the block parameter. For example, if the block parameter is dark
blue, the parameter is enabled. If it is light grey, it is disabled. To enable
or disable a parameter, click on it.

More direct changes to registers and bit fields can be made in the memory map,
which is linked from the chip block diagram through the “Proceed to Memory Map”
button. In this view, names, addresses, and data can be manually altered by the
user.

   Bench Set-Up

ACE also contains the Macro Tool, which can be used to record register reads and
writes. This is executed in the memory map view or with the initialization
wizard. To use, check the “Record Sub-Commands” checkbox and press the record
button. Changes in the memory map, which are bolded until they are applied to
the part, are recorded as UI commands by the macro tool once the changes are
made. Changed register write commands for the controls are also recorded. Hit
“Apply Changes” to execute the commands and make changes in the memory map. To
stop recording, click the “Stop Recording” button. A macro tool page with the
command steps will be created. The macro can be saved using the “Save Macro”
button so that it may be loaded for future use.

   Macro tool in ACE. The *Stop Recording*, *Record*, and *Save Macro* commands are located at the top of the macro tool.

The raw macro file will be saved using ACE syntax, which is not easily readable.
To remedy this, the ACE software download includes the Macro to Hex Conversion
Tool. The user can choose to include or exclude register write, reads, and/or
comments in the conversion. The file pathways for the source and save paths
should be the same, except that one should be an .acemacro file and the other
should be a .txt file. The “Convert” button converts and opens the converted
text file, which is easier to read. The conversion tool can also convert back to
an .acemacro file if desired.
