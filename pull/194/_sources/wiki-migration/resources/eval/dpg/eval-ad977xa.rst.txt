-  Connect continuous wave generator for clock input to SMA J2 DAC_CLK/DAC_CLK_P and DAC output from SMA J4 (IOUT1P) or SMA J8 (IOUT2P) to a signal/spectrum analyzer.
-  Set clock input to 400MHz, 3dBm.
-  Open ACE. The board will be automatically recognized by the software. Click the plugin. Otherwise, install the :adi:`ACE plugin <plugins/ace/Board.AD9779A.1.2020.3200.acezip>` for AD977xA.

-  To change the settings of the AD977xA chip, double click on the AD977xA block on the board view to access the chip. The default values for the register is displayed and set. The values can be changed on the Chip View GUI, or on the **Memory Map** for registers not available in the GUI. For more info on the memory map, refer to :adi:`AD977XA <static/imported-files/data_sheets/AD9776A_AD9778A_AD9779A.pdf>` datasheet. Once the desired values are set, Click **Apply Changes** and then **Read All** on the upper right window.

-  In DPG Downloader Lite, from the **Add Generator Waveforms** pulldown menu select **Single Tone** and apply the settings as shown in Figure 5. Set the **Data Rate** to 100MHz and Desired Frequency to 10.2MHz. Uncheck the **Unsigned Data** box and Check the **Generate Complex Data (I & Q)**.
-  Select the I/Q tone from the **I/Q Data Vector** pulldown menu.
-  Press the download arrow and then the play button. The spectrum similar to Figure 6 should appear in the signal/spectrum analyzer.

Using the AD9516 as clock source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, solder jumpers JP5 and JP6 are configured to drive the AD977xA clock inputs directly by SMA J2. This jumper setting is shown on Figure 7a. The AD9516 is included so the user can test the performance (e.g. ACLR) with the AD9516 clock multiplication.

-  To use the AD9616 to drive the clock inputs, the solder jumpers should be reconfigured as shown in Figure 7b. Connect continuous wave generator for clock input to SMA J1 (REF_CLK_IN). Set to 100MHz, 3dBm output.

-  Proceed with the DPG Lite procedure above.

Using the ADL5375 Modulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, solder jumpers JP1, JP2, JP3, and JP4 are configured to route the DAC outputs to SMA J4 (IOUT1P) and to J8 (IOUT2P). This jumper setting is shown on Figure 10a. To connect the DAC output to the filter that feeds into the ADL5375, the solder jumpers should be reconfigured as shown in Figure 7b. Source the desired LO of the modulator (e.g. 900 or 1800MHz, 3dBm) on SMA J19 (LO IN). The ADL5375 Modulator output can be observed on SMA J6 (RF OUT).

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section lists items to check and practices to use when debugging any unexpected performance of a board. If unexpected results occur:

-  Check the voltage rails of the evaluation board. P4, P5, and TP4 should be 5V; TP6, TP8, and TP16 should be 3.3V; TP1 and TP3 should be 1.8V.
-  Check if all (3) blue LEDs on the AD-DAC-FMC-ADP board is lit up. Reconnect the board to the FMC connector of SDP-H1 if not lit up.
-  Check if the SDP-H1 is being supplied properly by 12Vdc adaptor. Some LEDs on the SDP-H1 should lit up.
-  Perform a chip reset by pressing S2 on the AD977xA evaluation board.
-  Power cycle both the SDP-H1 and the AD977xA evaluation board.
-  Probe C76 and C78 to make sure a clock signal is being sent into the DAC.
-  Check if XD1 is lit up on the evaluation board. Reconnect/replace the USB cable connection to the evaluation board if it's not lit up.
-  Disconnect and reconnect the SDP-H1 and AD977xA evaluation board. Reopen ACE and DPG Lite software.
