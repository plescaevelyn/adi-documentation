Programming Reference
=====================

All the functions of a DPG can be accessed through a set of Dynamic-Link Library
(DLL) functions. These functions can be accessed via two different Windows®
software interface standards:

-  Component Object Model (COM)
-  .NET Framework

When possible, the .NET version should be used instead of the COM version. It
provides a more efficient and robust interface.

Class Organization
------------------

The following chart describes the organization of the various interfaces and classes used. A Hardware Interface (sometimes referred to as a "driver") implements the code required to communicate with a specific model of hardware. The Interface which describes what functions these drivers will implement is the `#ihardwareinterface <https://wiki.analog.com/>`_ interface. For each device that is currently connected, a Hardware Device object is created. This object is used to communicate with a specific, physical device. All of these Hardware Device objects abide by the `#ihardwaredevice <https://wiki.analog.com/>`_ interface.

   :align: center

To connect to a DPG, an instance of the correct Hardware Interface must be
created. This instance will provide an array of IHardwareDevice's corresponding
to all the attached devices.

Getting Started with COM
------------------------

Unlike the .NET interface, you must connect directly to the appropriate Hardware
Interface for the type of hardware you are connecting to. The individual
hardware interfaces are registered with COM when the DAC Software Suite is
installed. The ProgID of each interface is in the form "AnalogDevices.x", where
x is the name of the hardware type. For example, the DPG2 Hardware Interface is
registered with COM as AnalogDevices.DPG2.

Once the hardware interface is opened, all the functions listed in the `#ihardwareinterface <https://wiki.analog.com/>`_ interface can be used, as well as the functions in `#ihardwaredevice <https://wiki.analog.com/>`_ for any devices returned by the interface. Additional functions specific to the current hardware may also be available. Using these functions will limit the application to the current device type.

Getting Started with .NET
-------------------------

The AnalogDevices.DPG.Interfaces assembly provides the starting point for
communicating with a DPG. This assembly exposes a number of interfaces, as well
as the AnalogDevices.DPG.PluginFinder namespace.

The AnalogDevices.DPG.PluginFinder Namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This namespace provides a mechanism for locating the various hardware drivers
that might be present on a user's PC. It should generally be used instead of a
direct link to the hardware driver, to allow for future expansion.

Two methods are exposed, which both search for hardware drivers:

.. code:: csharp

   IHardwareInterface[] FindPlugins()

This will return an array of all the available Hardware Interfaces (drivers) on
the current PC.

.. code:: csharp

   IHardwareInterface[] FindPluginsFiltered(string filter)

This function returns a list of the available Hardware Interfaces whose name
matches the filter. For example, to search for only the DPG2 driver, the filter
would be set to "DPG2". Using this function with a filter of "\*" is identical
to just calling FindPlugins().

IHardwareInterface
------------------

This interface defines the properties and methods that a particular hardware
driver will support.

COM Guid:C18A8C19-4DE7-4b2f-9A7F-91AF8BE9C2BD

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: csharp

   string FriendlyName

This property returns a human-readable string describing the hardware driver. It is commonly used when presenting the user with a list of available interfaces to choose from. *Read-Only.*

.. code:: csharp

   IHardwareDevice[] AttachedDevices

AttachedDevices returns an array of Hardware Device objects. Each object corresponds to exactly one physically connected device. If no devices are connected, an array of length zero will be returned. *Read-Only.*

IHardwareDevice
---------------

This interface describes the basic functions that all Hardware Device drivers
will support.

COM Guid:108DE7EA-B745-4b45-A90C-0533998CACBD

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: csharp

   int DeviceIndex

The Device Index differentiates between multiple devices of the same type which are connected to the same PC at the same time. For some devices, such as the DPG2, this value is also displayed on the hardware itself. Setting this value is not recommended. The driver will automatically assign indexes as new devices are attached. Note that the indexes are not guaranteed to be the same each time the device is connected, nor are the indexes guaranteed to be sequential. *Read/Write.*

.. code:: csharp

   DataAlignmentE DataAlignment

Specifies if the data presented is MSB aligned or LSB aligned. If the data is LSB aligned, no alignment processing is performed on the data. If the data is MSB aligned, the data is shifted to the left by 16-*DataWidth* bits. *Read/Write.*

.. code:: csharp

   int DataWidth

Specifies the width (resolution) of the data, in bits. *Read/Write.*

.. code:: csharp
