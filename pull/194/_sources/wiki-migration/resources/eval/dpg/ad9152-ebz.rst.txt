-----------------------------------------------------------------

What's in the Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :adi:`AD9152-EBZ` Evaluation Board
-  Evaluation Board CD
-  Mini-USB Cable

Recommended Equipment List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  +5Vdc, Power Supply
-  1 Sinusoidal Clock Source
-  Spectrum Analyzer
-  Data Pattern Generator Series 3 (DPG3)

Introduction
------------

The AD9152-EBZ connects to a DPG3 for quick evaluation of the :adi:`AD9152`, a high-speed, signal processing Digital to Analog Converter. The DPG3 automatically formats the data and sends it to the AD9152-EBZ, simplifying evaluation of the device. The Evaluation Board (EVB) runs from a +5V supply. A clock distribution chip AD9516 is included on this EVB as a clock fan-out and frequency divider for the DACCLK, REFCLK and DPG3 input clock. Figure 2 is an image of the top side of the AD9152-EBZ.

AD9152 Evaluation Software
--------------------------

The AD9152 Evaluation Board software includes the ACE software application and DPGDownloader software. There is an easy-to-use legacy graphical user interface (GUI) available on the DPG website at http://www.analog.com/dpg, but ACE is the preferred evaluation method for the AD9152. ACE is included on the Evaluation Board CD or can be downloaded from the ACE website at http://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/ace-software.html. The legacy GUI and DPGDownloader software are available on the DPG website at http://www.analog.com/dpg. This will install DPGDownloader (for generating and loading vectors into the DPG3) and AD9152 SPI software.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Connect +5.0V to P5, GND to P6. A low phase noise high frequency clock source should be connected to the SMA connector, J1. This is the DACCLK input. The spectrum analyzer should be connected to the SMA connector, J4. A +1.0V power supply must be connected to the VTT probe point near SMA connector J9, along with a GND connection to the GND probe point next to it. The evaluation board connects to the DPG3 through the connectors P4. The PC should be connected to the EVB using the mini-USB connector XP2 after installation of the Evaluation Board software. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the set-up.

ACE Software Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ACE software is organized to allow the user to evaluate and control the AD9122A evaluation board. The “Initial Configuration” wizard, which is only available for certain boards, controls the DAC and PLL setups. Block diagram views of the board and chip contain elements that can be used to vary parameters like ref current and data format. These parameters can be changed using check boxes, drop down menus, and input boxes. Some parameters do not have settings shown in the diagram. Double click on the parameter to view the available settings, seen with the NCO settings below.

   Bench Set-Up


ACE also contains the Macro Tool, which can be used to record register reads and writes. This is executed in the memory map view or with the initialization wizard. To use, check the “Record Sub-Commands” checkbox and press the record button. Changes in the memory map, which are bolded until they are applied to the part, are recorded as UI commands by the macro tool once the changes are made. Changed register write commands for the controls are also recorded. Hit “Apply Changes” to execute the commands and make changes in the memory map. To stop recording, click the “Stop Recording” button. A macro tool page with the command steps will be created. The macro can be saved using the “Save Macro” button so that it may be loaded for future use.

   Macro tool in ACE. The *Stop Recording*, *Record*, and *Save Macro* commands are located at the top of the macro tool.


The raw macro file will be saved using ACE syntax, which is not easily readable. To remedy this, the ACE software download includes the Macro to Hex Conversion Tool. The user can choose to include or exclude register write, reads, and/or comments in the conversion. The file pathways for the source and save paths should be the same, except that one should be an .acemacro file and the other should be a .txt file. The “Convert” button converts and opens the converted text file, which is easier to read. The conversion tool can also convert back to an .acemacro file if desired.
