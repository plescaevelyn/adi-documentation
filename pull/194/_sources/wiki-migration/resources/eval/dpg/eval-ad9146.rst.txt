EVALUATING THE AD9146 DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER
=================================================

Preface
-------

This user guide describes both the hardware and software setup needed to acquire data capture from :adi:`AD9146-M5375-EBZ <eval-ad9146>` evaluation board to characterize :adi:`AD9146` dual 16-bit 1230 MSPS TxDAC+® digital-to-analog converter.

This guide shows how AD9146-M5375-EBZ works with :adi:`SDP-H1 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-sdp-h1.html>` or :adi:`ADS7-V2 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ads7-v2.html>` controller board developed by Analog Devices.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

-  Make sure that on the evaluation board, JP4, JP5, JP6, and JP7 are configured such that I and Q outputs are connected to the corresponding baluns (T7, T8). Refer to Figure 6. Configure JP10 and JP15 such that AD9146 clock input is connected to AD9516 clock divider/buffer. Refer to Figure 5.
-  Attach the evaluation board to the FMC connector of SDP-H1 or ADS7-V2 using the AD-DAC-FMC-ADP adapter board. Connect continuous wave generator for clock input to J1, and the DAC output from J5 or J9 to a signal/spectrum analyzer. Connect the evaluation board to PC via USB and to a 5Vdc 2A power supply via banana plug cables. Refer to Figures 1a and 1b.

   -  If using **SDP-H1**, set clock input to **100 MHz and 0 dBm**. Connect SDP-H1 to PC via USB and to a 12Vdc wall wart.
   -  If using **ADS7-V2**, set the clock input to **500 MHz and 0 dBm**. Connect ADS7-V2 to PC via USB and to a 12V 60W AC/DC power supply. Switch the board ON using S1 beside the connector for 12V supply.

-  Open ACE. The board will automatically be recognized by the software. Otherwise, install the plugin for AD9146 evaluation board. Apply the configuration wizard settings shown in Figure 2a for SDP-H1 and in Figure 2b for ADS7-V2.

::

     * If using **SDP-H1**, set **DAC frequency** to 100 MHz, **Interpolation** to 2x and **Data Format** to binary format.
     * If using **ADS7-V2**, set **DAC frequency** to 500 MHz, **Interpolation** to 2x and **Data Format** to binary format.
   * In ACE, AD9146 on-chip PLL can be enabled or not. To enable the on-chip PLL check the **Enable PLL Clock** in the wizard under **AD9146 PLL Setup**. Select **Auto Mode** for PLL Mode option. The **PLL Locked** LED on the ACE Board View should light up green. If the LED doesn't light up, try reapplying the wizard configuration and make sure that the VCO frequency is within the valid range of 1 - 2.1 GHz.
   * Start DPG Lite or DPG Downloader.
     * At the SDP-H1 part of the software, the device part number and **DCO frequency** of around **100 MHz** should be displayed.
     * At the ADS7-V2 part of the software, the device part number and **DCO frequency** of around **500 MHz** should be displayed.
   * In DPG Lite or DPG Downloader, from the **Add Generator Waveforms** pulldown menu, select **Single Tone** and apply the settings as shown in Figures 3a and 3b. The data rate in DPG software should be equal to the data rate in ACE.
     * When using SDP-H1, set **Data Rate** to 50 MHz and **Desired Frequency** to 10 MHz.
     * When using ADS7-V2, set **Data Rate** to 250 MHz and **Desired Frequency** to 21 MHz.
   * Continuing on setting up DPG Lite or DPG Downloader, set **DAC resolution** to 16 bits. Check off the **Generate Complex Data (I & Q)** box.\\

Reconfiguring the Evaluation Board
----------------------------------

Jumpers for Selecting the Clock Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9146 has an on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) that uses the REFCLKP and REFCLKN pins to supply the reference clock. The AD9146-M5375-EBZ can supply the clock either from the AD9516-0 clock chip or from an additional external signal generator by connecting to J14. Connecting the inner pads to JP10 and JP15 selects the option to use the AD9146 by default, whereas soldering the outer pads chooses the external option to drive from a sine source.

   \ |image5|\ *Figure 5. DAC clock input is connected to AD9516 clock divider/buffer (default)*\


Jumpers for Selecting DAC Output Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9146-M5375-EBZ evaluates both the DAC I/Q outputs as well as the modulator RF outputs. Table 1 lists the jumper configurations and the SMA connections needed to view either the DAC IF outputs or the RF outputs on the spectrum analyzer.


|image6|

The evaluation board has four three pad solder jumpers, two for each DAC (IOUT1N and IOUT1P, and IOUT2 N and IOUT2P). Use these solder jumpers, JP4 through JP7, to choose between viewing the DAC output or the modulator output. By default, the jumpers are configured to view the DAC output. For the modulator, solder the inner pads.

Hardware Provisions for Power Supplies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9146-M5375-EBZ has five, two pin jumpers for each of the different power supplies on the board (see Table 2). By default, all of these jumpers must be populated.


|image8|

Jumper for Transmit Enable pin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9146 has a transmit enable feature (active low) that allows the user to control when the DACs transmit and when the outputs are clamped. This feature can be used by forcing a voltage on the TXENABLE pin via a test point. By default, the TXENABLE pin is set by the controller. Connect JP1 horizontally, as shown in Figure 7. To drive the TXENABLE pin manually, leave the jumper unsoldered.
