GENERAL DESCRIPTION


The :adi:`AD9525` evaluation board is a compact, easy to use platform for evaluating all features of the :adi:`AD9525`. Two versions of the evaluation board are available : one with a prepopulated external VCO and loop filter (AD9525/PCBZ-VCO) and one with no VCO/VCXO and no loop filter (AD9525/PCBZ). This user guide focuses on the AD9525/PCBZ-VCO, which already has a VCO and loop filter on board. The :adi:`AD9525` provides a low power, multioutput, clock distribution function with low jitter performance, along with an on-chip PLL that can be used with an external VCO or VCXO. The VCO input and eight LVPECL outputs can operate up to a frequency of 3.6 GHz. All outputs share a common divider that can provide a division of 1 to 6. The :adi:`AD9525` also offers a dedicated output that can be used to provide a programmable signal for resetting or synchronizing a data converter. For more information about the device, see the :adi:`AD9525` data sheet. This user guide should be used in conjunction with the :adi:`AD9525` data sheet and the software documentation available at www.analog.com/clocks

EVALUATION BOARD HARDWARE


| The instructions in this section are for setting up the physical connections to the AD9525/PCBZ-VCO evaluation board with a prepopulated VCO. There is another version of the evaluation board (AD9525/PCBZ) that does not contain an external VCO. The two variations of the evaluation boards have slightly different default configurations.
| When connecting the evaluation board to a PC for the first time, you must install the evaluation software prior to connecting the evaluation board. If a previous version of the software is already installed, uninstall it before installing the latest version.

Power and PC Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Install the AD9525 evaluation software, uninstall prior versions of the software before installation updates. Administrative privileges are required for installation. The 64-bit versions of Windows® are supported.
-  Connect the 6V wall power supply to the main power connector labeled P500.
-  Connect the USB cable to the evaluation board and the computer. The red LED labeled CR400 on the AD9525 evaluation board should illuminate.
-  If the **Found New Hardware Wizard** window automatically appears when the evaluation board is connected, select **Install the software automatically** and click **Next**. The **Found New Hardware Wizard** window may appear twice, and a system restart may be required.

Refer to the Evaluation Board Software section for details on running the AD9525 evaluation board software.

Signal Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect signals:

-  Connect a signal generator to the J202 (REF A) SMA connector or to the J204 (REF B) SMA connector. By default, the reference inputs on this evaluation board are ac-coupled and terminated 50 Ω to ground. An amplitude setting of 0 dBm to 6 dBm is sufficient.
-  Connect an oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, or other lab equipment to any of the J301 to J316 SMA clock OUT connectors on the edge of the board.

   -  OUT0 through OUT7 are ac-coupled LVPECL outputs terminated 150 Ω to ground.
   -  OUT3 and OUT6 contain a balun for differential to single-ended conversion. Connector J317 and J318 are for the SYNC_OUT distribution and are also ac-coupled LVPECL outputs terminated 150 Ω to ground.
   -  SYNC_OUT can be configured as two single-ended CMOS outputs, in which case each line should be terminated with a series resistor.

Bypassing the PLL (Clock Distribution Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To bypass the PLL:

-  Connect a signal generator to the SMA connector labeled CLKIN.
-  Remove C215.
-  Install a 0 Ω resistor or ac coupling capacitor at R218. By default, this path contains a 6 dB T-type attenuator in between Connector J206 and the CLKIN pin.

The AD9525 default register settings configure the device as an eight output clock buffer.

Using An Off-Board VCO/VCXO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use an off-board VCO or VCXO:

-  Remove the original VCO/VCXO or disconnect all supply voltages. (You may see coupling between the VCO/VCXO paths if two VCO/VCXOs are powered at the same time, causing pulling.)
-  Install a 0 Ω resistor at R217 and remove R225.
-  Connect the external VCO/VCXO voltage tune input to J200 (CP_OUTPUT).
-  Remove C215 and install a 0 Ω resistor or ac coupling capacitor at R218.
-  Connect the off-board VCO/VCXO output to the J206 SMA connector (CLKIN).
-  Design and populate a loop filter for the desired loop bandwidth and phase margin.

Note that the right angle SMA connectors on the evaluation board are not optimal for high speed signals. They are provided for ease of use but may cause loss of performance at speeds greater than 1.5 GHz.

LOOP FILTER DESIGN


The AD9525 PLL requires an external VCO or VCXO and a loop filter containing components tailored for a given application. The third-order passive configuration shown in Figure 2 usually results in the best performance for many applications and is the one found on the evaluation board.

.. container:: centeralign


   ..

|image2|

   **Figure 2. PLL Loop Filter**


The loop bandwidth of a PLL with a second-order filter (excluding R2 and C3) can be approximated using the following equation:

.. container:: centeralign

   :math:`BW=R1 \times I_CP \times K_VCO/2pi \times N_Total`


where:

-  **K\ VCO** is the gain of the external VCO.
-  **I\ CP** is the current of the charge pump.
-  **R1** is the resistance labeled in Figure 2.
-  **N\ TOTAL** is the total of the feedback divider (set by a prescaler P, divider B, and divider M). Divider M only alters **N\ TOTAL** if the output frequency of the AD9525 is an integer division of the VCO frequency. **N\ TOTAL** is defined by the following equation: :math:`N_Total=P \times B \times M`

| Because **K\ VCO** is determined by the VCO vendor, the bandwidth of the loop can be adjusted by changing the values of **I\ CP** and **N\ TOTAL**. Note that **I\ CP** has a limited range, and **N\ TOTAL** is limited by the selectable values of Prescaler P, Divider B, and Divider M. For more information about **N\ TOTAL** and **I\ CP**, including possible values, see the AD9525 data sheet.
| To determine the best loop filter for a given application, use :adi:`ADIsimCLK™ <ADISIMCLK>` (Version 1.5 or greater), which is free and can be downloaded from the :adi:`ADIsimCLK Design and Evaluation Software <ADISIMCLK>` Web page. This software aids in designing and exploring the capabilities and features of the AD9525, including designing the PLL loop filter.
| The AD9525 evaluation board can be purchased with either a Z-Comm CRO2950B-LF external VCO or with no VCO populated. This section discusses a couple of different external VCO possibilities and their respective loop filter designs and performance. Using a high performance VCO with low phase noise allows you to create a low loop bandwidth filter to remove the jitter contained on the input reference clock.

Using the Evaluation Board with a Z-Comm CRO2950B-LF VCO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first setup discussed is the default evaluation board configured with a Z-Comm CRO2950B-LF VCO. With the charge pump set to 1.8 mA and the feedback divider set to 24, the on-board loop filter produces a loop bandwidth of ~6 kHz and ~69° of phase margin. Table 1 shows the parameters used to attain the resulting phase noise measurements described in Figure 4. A phase noise plot of the Z-Comm CRO2950B-LF VCO is shown in Figure 3.

Using the Evaluation Board with a Different VCO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second setup discussed uses the evaluation board with the on-board VCO and loop filter removed. Instead, this setup uses a separate VCO daughter board with a Bowei MVCO1475 VCO and a two-pole loop filter. With the charge pump set to 1.8 mA and the N divider set to 12, the loop filter was designed to give ~11 kHz of bandwidth and ~70° of phase margin. Table 3 shows the parameters used to attain the resulting phase noise measurements described in Figure 7. A phase noise plot of the Bowei MVCO1475 VCO is shown in Figure 6.

QUICK START GUIDE TO THE AD9525 PLL


| The AD9525 quick start guide is intended for direct use with the AD9525/PCBZ-VCO evaluation board containing a prepopulated Z-COMM CRO2950B-LF external VCO. Although the AD9525/PCBZ can be populated with a different external VCO/VCXO, the settings discussed in this quick start guide may not be directly applicable. This guide covers only simple PLL operation to lock the PLL. See the AD9525 data sheet and the Evaluation Software Components section for a detailed explanation of the various AD9525 features.
| The AD9525 website contains a setup file to configure the AD9525/PCBZ-VCO to the settings discussed in this section. The setup file can be found online :adi:`here <en/clock-and-timing/clock-generation-and-distribution/ad9525/products/EVAL-AD9525/eb.html>`. After being downloaded, the setup file can be loaded into the evaluation board by opening the AD9525 evaluation software, selecting Load Setup from the File menu, and selecting the appropriate .stp file. The values in Table 5 are used for the example discussed in the Quick Start Steps section.

Quick Start Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the evaluation software is installed, the evaluation board is connected, and the software is loaded, use the following steps to configure and lock the PLL. These steps assume that the input signal is present to REF A, that the evaluation board has not been modified, and that the PLL loop filter is suitable for a given application.

-  Type the intended reference input frequency (in megahertz) in the REF A MHz box at the upper left corner of the main window and press ENTER.
-  Type the appropriate R\ :sub:`A` divider value in the REF INPUTS block and press ENTER. The box surrounding the value of REF A should be outlined in black and illuminated, and the mux symbol should show the REF A signal going to the PFD (see Figure 11). If other references, such as REF B or REF C, are lit, they do not become active until they are selected by the mux.

.. container:: centeralign

   
   |image9| **Figure 11. Reference Inputs Block**


-  Program the N (feedback) divider by clicking the N text box inside of the green APLL block (see Figure 12) Type the desired value and press ENTER. For this example, N = 48 is used (see Figure 12). Note that the N divider is limited to the range of values that can be obtained by multiplying the B and P dividers. See the AD9525 data sheet for more details.

.. container:: centeralign

   
   |image10| **Figure 12. APLL Block**


-  Set the charge pump current multiplier (8× in this case) by clicking APLL Registers, located under the green APLL block, and selecting 8x (default) from the Charge Pump Current drop-down menu (see Figure 19).
-  Set the VCO divider (M divider) by clicking the M text box in the green APLL block (see Figure 12). Type the preferred divide value (1 in this case) and press ENTER. Note that both the N divider and M divider make up the NTOTAL divider. The NTOTAL is detailed in the AD9525 data sheet.
-  The output frequency of the AD9525 is then displayed in the Output Frequency box on the right side of the window.

.. container:: centeralign

   
   |image11| **Figure 13. Output Frequency Box**


-  Power down any unused drivers by clicking DIST REGISTERS, located under the blue OUTPUT DIST block (see Figure 14) on the right side of the main window. The Distribution window opens.
-  Check that each output is powered off in the Power Down PECL Driver box of the Distribution window, and then click Load near the bottom of the window for these settings to be programmed into the evaluation board (see Figure 14).
