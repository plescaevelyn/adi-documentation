**EVALUATION KIT CONTENTS** ADR1000H-EBZ

**EQUIPMENT NEEDED** Benchtop Lab Supply capable of 12V to 18V (15V nominal) Several Digit DMM (such as HP3458 or Keithley 2001) Two banana plug cables, or one dual cable One additional cable for meters with Guard, or use Pomona 1167-18

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION** The ADR1000H-EBZ allows the evaluation of the ADR1000AHZ, ultra-stable 6.6V Shunt Voltage Reference in 8-Pin TO-99 package.

The DUT is centered in a fan shaped cutout of the PCB, designed to weaken mechanical coupling from the PCB to the DUT (effective for temperature and humidity, but not flexure). There are also thermal "baffles" (slots) in the PCB to keep heat from coupling from the heater transistor to the control circuit, and between the DUT and the resistors. The heater temperature is set by the standard 13k:1k divider as with the old LTZ1000. However, the ADR1000 runs about 5 degrees warmer (75C) than the LTZ1000 (70C), due to the slightly lower voltage of the ADR1000 applied to the divider.

EVALUATION BOARD QUICK START PROCEDURES

The following sections outline the basic prepopulated configuration of the ADR1000H-EBZ required to test the basic functionality of the ADR1000 and the application circuit.

POWER SUPPLY CONSIDERATION The board is most easily powered through the small red and black turrets at TP4 (red) and TP7 (black) at the left hand side of the board. But ensure JP1 and JP2 are installed. Apply 15V typically.

INITIAL BOARD CONFIGURATION The ADR1000H-EBZ comes pre-configured with jumpers on JP1 and JP2. These jumpers force the opamp and Zener circuit to use the same power (VANA and VHEATER) and ground (AGND and HGND/DGND). The simplest way to get started is to leave the jumpers in place and apply 15V to TP4 (red) and TP7 (black). If you wish to use different supplies for the heater and the Reference circuit, remove JP1. Then you can run the Zener un-heated using the VANA and AGND on T1 wiring block, or run heated by also driving TP4 (red) with an independent supply. Leaving JP2 installed keeps all grounds shorted (DGND/HGND and AGND). If you remove JP2, this disconnects DGND/HGND from AGND. **Caution: do not take DGND/HGND below AGND, as this will forward the substrate on ADR1000.**

USING THE EVALUATION BOARD FOR TESTING The board was designed to mate to a standard 0.75" centered HP3458 or equivalent precision DMM. The banana plugs and jacks are not soldered to the board, so you can remove them and re-install them depending on how you wish to mate to the DMM. Figure 1d shows the board mated with HP3458, banana plugs installed on the secondary side so that the voltage measured is positive, and with Ref- connected to the HP3458 Guard.

The board is not isolated, so power it with a conventional floating output benchtop power supply. Just power the board using one of the methods discussed, and start measuring the output DC voltage.
