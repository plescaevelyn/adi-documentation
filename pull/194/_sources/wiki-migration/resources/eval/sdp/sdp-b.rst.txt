Preface
-------

The SDP-B is used as part of the evaluation system for many ADI components. The SDP-B board is designed to be used in conjunction with various ADI component evaluation boards as part of a customer evaluation environment. The SDP provides `USB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB>`_ connectivity through a USB 2.0 high speed connection to the computer allowing users to evaluate components on this platform from a PC application. The SDP-B is based on :adi:`ADSP-BF527` Blackfin processor, with the Blackfin processor peripheral communication lines available to the component daughter board through the two identical 120-pin small footprint connectors
