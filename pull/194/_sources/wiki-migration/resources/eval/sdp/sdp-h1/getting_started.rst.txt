SDP-H1 Getting Started
======================

This page provides specific information to assist you with using the SDP board
as part of your evaluation system.

Package Contents
----------------

Your EVAL-SDP-CH1Z board package contains the following items.

-  :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CH1Z <sdp>` board
-  1m USB Standard-A to mini-B cable
-  12V 30W wall wart

Contact the vendor where you purchased your SDP board or contact Analog Devices,
Inc. if any item is missing.

PC Configuration
----------------

For correct operation of the SDP board, your computer must have the following
minimum configuration

-  Windows XP Service Pack 2 32 bit, Windows Vista 32/64 bit, Windows 7 32/64 bit
-  USB 2.0 port

.. warning::

   The SDP board evaluation system contains ESD (electrostatic discharge)
   sensitive devices. Electrostatic charges readily accumulate on the human body
   and equipment and can discharge without detection. Permanent damage may occur
   on devices subjected to high-energy discharges. Proper ESD precautions are
   recommended to avoid performance degradation or loss of functionality. Store
   unused SDP boards in the protective shipping package.

   
   When removing the SDP board from the package, handle the board carefully to
   avoid the discharge of static electricity, which can damage some components.

USB Installation
----------------

Perform the following tasks to safely install the SDP board onto the computer.

There are two stages in the software application installation procedure. The
first installs the application software. The second installs the .NET Framework
3.5 and the necessary drivers.

-  Run the application install provided. The first stage will install the Applications GUI and necessary support files onto the computer
-  Immediately following the application install, the .NET Framework 3.5 and the
   driver package for the SDP board is installed. If the .NET Framework 3.5 is
   already pre-installed on the computer in question, this stage will be skipped
   and step two will consist of a driver package installation only

Connecting the SDP-H1 Board to the PC
