BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer
==========================

Preface
-------

The BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer board is an adaptor that allows Arrow’s `BeMicro SDK <https://www.arrow.com/en/datasheets/89166696/arrow-development-tools/bemicrosdk>`_ USB stick to connect to all daughter boards on the SDP Platform. The BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer provides embedded FPGA system developers the chance to prototype their FPGA + ADI data converter, mixed signal or RF system concept quickly and easily.

.. tip::

   This interposer is not an ADI product, and information here is shown to help
   out ADI's customers who which to evaluate an ADI product with the BeMicro
   SDK. The BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer has nothing to do with the SDP Controller
   Boards, and the BeMicro SDK will not run the SDP product evaluation software.
   As such, it is not avalible for sale from ADI.

Product Overview
----------------

| Fig 1 : BeMicro SDK/SDP Adapter Board

The BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer routes signals from the BeMicro SDK to the SDP
daughter board. There is no additional logic on board. There is a mating edge
connector for the BeMicro SDK and a 120 pin connector header for connecting to
the SDP daughter boards.

The BeMicro SDK, developed by Arrow in association with Altera, is a complete
soft core embedded processor evaluation system on a USB stick. It makes embedded
FPGA design simpler and easier. The BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer offer
unparalleled design flexibility and protection against processor obsolescence in
an easy-to-use USB platform that’s ready to go as soon as it’s plugged in.

The complete setup is shown below:

-  BeMicro SDK
-  BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer
-  SDP Daughtercard

As such, in order to properly use the BeMicro SDK/SDP Interposer, you will need
both of:

-  the `BeMicro SDK <https://www.arrow.com/en/datasheets/89166696/arrow-development-tools/bemicrosdk>`_
-  an :adi:`ADI SDP Daughter Board <sdp#exallist>`
