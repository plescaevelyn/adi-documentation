.. warning::

   The SDP board evaluation system contains ESD (electrostatic discharge)
   sensitive devices. Electrostatic charges readily accumulate on the human body
   and equipment and can discharge without detection. Permanent damage may occur
   on devices subjected to high-energy discharges. Proper ESD precautions are
   recommended to avoid performance degradation or loss of functionality. Store
   unused SDP boards in the protective shipping package.

   
   When removing the SDP board from the package, handle the board carefully to
   avoid the discharge of static electricity, which can damage some components.

USB Installation
----------------

Perform the following tasks to safely install the SDP board onto the computer.

There are two stages in the software application installation procedure. The
first installs the application software. The second installs the .NET Framework
3.5 and the necessary drivers.

-  Run the application install provided. The first stage will install the Applications GUI and necessary support files onto the computer
-  Immediately following the application install, the .NET Framework 3.5 and the
