Preface
=======

The SDP-H1 is used as part of the evaluation system for many ADI components. the SDP-H1 board is designed to be used in conjunction with various ADI component evaluation boards as part of a customer evaluation environement.The SDP provides `USB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB>`_ connectivity through a USB 2.0 high speed connection to the computer allowing users to evaluate components on this platform from a PC application. The SDP-H1 has a Xilinx(R) Spartan(r)-6 FPGA and a :adi:`ADSP-BF527` Blackfin processor. It has an Low Pin Count (LPC) FMC connector and a 120 pin connector identical to that found on the SDP-B and SDP-S.
