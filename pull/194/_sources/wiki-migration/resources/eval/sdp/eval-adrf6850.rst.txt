.. container:: centeralign

   \ |image3| *Figure 3. ADRF6850 Evaluation Setup*\

-  Attach the SDP-S board on the evaluation board then connect SDP-S to PC via USB. See Figure 1.
-  Connect J2 (IBBP RF OUT) to the input of a spectrum analyzer. Connect the 50Ω
   termination to J3. Set up the analyzer as follows:

   -  **Ref:** 0 dBm
   -  **Center Freq.:** 20 MHz
   -  **Freq. Span:** 5 MHz
   -  **RBW and VBW:** 100 KHz
   -  **Attn.:** 30 dB (adjust until noise floor like in Figure 4 is achieved)

-  Connect a high-frequency signal generator to J9 (RF IN). Set the signal generator output to **520 MHz and 0 dBm**, then enable the output.
-  Connect 3.3V 0.5A supply to VCC and GND test points then 0V VGAIN. Enable the supplies. The 3.3V supply should be sourcing current between 110 mA and 135 mA.
-  Run the evaluation software on PC. Refer to Figure 2.

   -  Click “Select SPI Mode” (top left).
   -  Click “Write Default Settings” (just to the right of above button). The +3.3V current should increase to between 310 mA and 380 mA.
   -  Set “LO Frequency” to 540MHz and click “Program LO Frequency”.

-  A tone at **20MHz** with a level of **-2 dBm to -4 dBm** should appear on the spectrum analyzer. The tone should be steady at a frequency of 20MHz. Refer to the screenshot in Figure 4.

Hardware Description
--------------------

Power Supplies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An external +3.3 V supply (DUT + 3.3 V) powers each of the nine VCCx supplies on
the ADRF6850 as well as the 13.5 MHz clock reference.

Recommended Decoupling for Supplies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initially, the external +3.3 V supply is decoupled by a 10 μF capacitor and then
further by a parallel combination of 100 nF and 56 pF capacitors that are placed
as close to the DUT as possible for good local decoupling. The impedance of all
these capacitors should be low and constant across a broad frequency range.
Surface-mount multilayered ceramic chip (MLCC) Class II capacitors provide very
low ESL and ESR, which assist in decoupling supply noise effectively. They also
provide good temperature stability and good aging characteristics. Capacitance
changes per the bias voltage that is applied. Larger case sizes have less
capacitance change vs. applied bias voltage, and also lower ESR but higher ESL.
A combination of 0402 size cases for the 56 pF capacitors and 0603 size cases
for the 100 nF capacitors give a good compromise allowing the 56 pF capacitors
to be placed as close as possible to the supply pins on the top side of the PCB
with the 100 nF capacitors placed on the bottom side of the PCB quite close to
the supply pins. X5R and X7R capacitors are examples of these types of
capacitors and are recommended for decoupling.

Baseband Outputs and VOCM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pair of I and Q baseband outputs are connected to the board by SMA
connectors. They are ac-coupled to the output connectors. VOCM, which sets the
common-mode output voltage, is grounded and the internal baseband (VOCM)
reference is selected by Register CR29, Bit 6. If the external baseband (VOCM)
reference is selected by setting this bit to a 0, then a voltage needs to be
applied through the pair of VCOM and GND test points and R20 needs to be
removed.

Loop Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~

A fourth-order loop filter is provided at the output of the charge pump and is
required to adequately filter noise from the Σ-Δ modulator used in the
N-divider. With the charge pump current set to a midscale value of 2.5 mA and
using the on-chip VCO, the loop bandwidth is approximately 50 kHz, and the phase
margin is 55°. C0G capacitors are recommended for use in the loop filter because
they have low dielectric absorption, which is required for fast and accurate
settling time. The use of non C0G capacitors may result in a long tail being
introduced into the PLL settling time transient.

Reference Input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference input can be supplied by a 13.5 MHz Jauch clock generator or by an
external clock through the use of Connector J7. The frequency range of the
reference input is from 10 MHz to 300 MHz with the PFD frequency limited to a
maximum of 30 MHz. Double the 13.5 MHz clock to 27 MHz by using the on-chip
reference frequency doubler to optimize phase noise performance.

TESTLO Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These pins are differential test inputs that allow a variety of debug options.
On this board, the capability is provided to drive these pins with an external
4× LO signal that is then applied to an Anaren balun to provide a differential
input signal.

When driving the TESTLO pins, the PLL can be bypassed, and the demodulator can
be driven directly by this external LO signal. The frequency of the LO signal
needs to be 4 times the operating frequency. These inputs also require a dc
bias. A dc bias of 3.3 V is the default option used on the board.

LOMON Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These pins are differential LO monitor outputs that provide a replica of the
internal LO frequency at 1× LO. The single-ended power in a 50 Ω load can be
programmed to −24 dBm, −18 dBm, −12 dBm, or −6 dBm. These open-collector outputs
must be terminated to 3.3 V. Because both outputs must be terminated to 50 Ω,
options are provided to terminate to 3.3 V using on-board 50 Ω resistors or by
series inductors (or a ferrite bead), in which case the 50 Ω termination is
provided by the measuring instrument.\\

CCOMPx Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~

The CCOMPx pins are internal compensation nodes that must be decoupled to ground
with a 100 nF capacitor.

MUXOUT
~~~~~~

MUXOUT is a test output that allows different internal nodes to be monitored. It
is a CMOS output stage that requires no termination.

Lock Detect (LDET)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lock detect is a CMOS output that indicates the state of the PLL. A high level
indicates a locked condition, and a low level indicates a loss of lock
condition.

RF Inputs (RFI, RFCM, /RFI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RFI and /RFI are 50 Ω internally biased RF inputs. For single-ended operation as
demonstrated on the evaluation board, RFI must be ac-coupled to the source and
/RFI must be ac-coupled to the ground plane. RFCM is the RF input common-mode
pin. It should be connected to /RFI when driving the input in single-ended mode.
When driving the input differentially using a balun, connect this pin to the
common terminal of the output coil of the balun.

VGAIN
~~~~~

The VGAIN pin sets the gain of the VGA. The VGAIN voltage range is from 0 V to
1.5 V. This allows the gain of the VGA to vary from 0 dB to +60 dB.
