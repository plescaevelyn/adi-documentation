SDP to FMC Interposer
=====================

Preface
-------

The SDP to FMC Interposer board is an adaptor that allows Xilinx FPGA Eval
boards to connect to all daughter boards on the SDP Platform. SDP daughter
boards are a wide range of component evaluation boards and Circuits from the Lab
(TM) reference circuits. The SDP-I-FMC interposer provides the capabilities to
prototype a Xilinx FPGA with an ADI data converter, mixed signal or RF system
quickly and easily.

The SDP to FMC Interposer routes signals from the FMC connector to the SDP
daughter board. There is no additional logic on the board. There is a Low Pin
Count (LPC) FMC connector on board. The SDP-I-FMC can only be used with FPGA
evaluation boards that have 3.3VIO logic.

The complete setup is shown below:

-  KC705 Eval Board
-  SDP-I-FMC Interposer board
-  SDP daughter board
