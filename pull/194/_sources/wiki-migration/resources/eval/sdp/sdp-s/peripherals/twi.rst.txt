TWI/I2C : TWO WIRE INTERFACE
============================

| The TWI / I\ :sup:`2`\ C bus is fully compatible with the widely used I\ :sup:`2`\ C bus standard as defined by Philips I\ :sup:`2`\ C Bus Specification version 2.1. Pull up resistors are present on both the SDA and SCL lines, so the lines will idle high at all times.
| Data Rates:up to 100K bits/second (Standard Mode)and up to 400K bits/second (Fast Mode)data rates

Normal Data Transfer

Repeated Start
--------------

A repeated start is where the control of the bus is help by the current master
between two consecutive transfers. It is the absense of a stop command betwen
two transfers. Transfers can be of any direction.
