General Description
-------------------

The AD9546 Evaluation Board is a compact, easy-to-use platform for evaluating all features of the :adi:`AD9546` multiple input, 10-Output, Dual Channel, Numeric Clock Synchronizer. The AD9546 supports existing and emerging International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standards for the delivery of frequency, phase, and time of day over service provider packet networks, including ITU-G.8262, ITU-T G.812, ITU-T G.813, ITU-T G.823, ITU-T G.824, ITU-T G.825, and ITU-T G.8273.2.

The 10 clock outputs of the AD9546 are synchronized to any one of up to four
input references. The digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs) reduce timing jitter
associated with the external references. The digitally controlled loop and
holdover circuitry continuously generate a low jitter output signal, even when
all reference inputs fail. The AD9546 system clock is provided by a 52 MHz
crystal. Alternatively, an external clock signal may be provided at a SMA
connector (relative components must be populated to enable this functionality).

EVALUATION BOARD HARDWARE
-------------------------

The following instructions are for setting up the physical connections to the
AD9546/PCBZ Evaluation Board. The user must install the Evaluation Software
prior to connecting the Evaluation Board for the first time.

The 6 V supply powers the following:

-  An Analog Devices :adi:`ADP2384 Switching Regulator <ADP2384>` configured to output 3.3 V or 1.8 V.
-  A dedicated Analog Devices 1.8 V :adi:`ADM7171 Low Noise LDO <ADM7171>` for the AD9546 power supply.
-  A dedicated Analog Devices 1.8 V :adi:`ADM7160 Ultralow Noise LDO <ADM7160>` for the AD9546 serial port and Mx pins power supplies.
-  A dedicated Analog Devices 1.8 V :adi:`ADM7160 Ultralow Noise LDO <ADM7160>` for the power supply of the level shifter and transceiver circuits.

By default, the 3.3 V ADP2384 switcher output supply supplies a 1.8 V Analog Devices :adi:`ADM7171 Low Noise LDO <ADM7171>` to power the :adi:`AD9546`. The :adi:`ADP2384 Switching Regulator <ADP2384>` can also be configured to output 1.8 V and directly power the :adi:`AD9546` to evaluate the :adi:`AD9546` when powered directly from a switching power supply. The :adi:`AD9546` can also be powered from external 3.3 V or 1.8 V supplies. To increase the SPI speed when the :adi:`AD9546` is managed through the USB connector, an additional power supply scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the :adi:`AD9546` VDD pins are supplied at 1.8 V from the above LDO, while the serial port and Mx pin VDDIOA and VDDIOB pins are supplied directly from the 3.3 V switching regulator.

In the following, various power supply solutions of the :adi:`AD9546` are presented together with the configurations of the 0 Ω resistors.

--------------

-  Install all required software, uninstall prior versions of the software before installation updates. Administrative privileges are required for installation.
-  Connect the 6 V wall power supply to the main power connector labeled P800. The red LED labelled DS801 turns on
-  Connect the USB cables to the Evaluation Board and to the computer. The red
   LED labeled DS500 by the USB connector turns on and the LED labeled DS501
   blinks.

Reference Clock Inputs
----------------------

The AD9546 Evaluation Board has four reference input sources. By default, REF
A/AA (Connectors J301 and J302, respectively) are configured as single ended
differential AC-coupled reference inputs. Each can be connected to a signal
generator directly. In contrast, REF B/BB (Connectors J303 and J304,
respectively) are configured for single-ended CMOS inputs by default. Each
reference input logic type is configurable via the Evaluation Software.

-  REF B is intended for a single ended AC-coupled reference input terminated with a 50 Ω resistor to ground.
-  REF BB is intended for a single ended DC-coupled reference input.

System Clock Inputs
-------------------

By default, the AD9546 system clock input is configured to the on-board 52 MHz
crystal. An additional path, not populated, may be used to provide a system
clock input at J305 connector.

P503 Connector / USB Interface
------------------------------

The connector P503 may be used to directly access the AD9546 from an external
device. A Raspberry PI 3 Model B+ may be used to interface with the AD9546
Evaluation Board at connector P503.

The signals available at connector P503 are the SPI pins (SCLK, SDIO, SDO, CSB)
and the M0, M1, M2 and M3 control pins. Jumpers at connectors P507 and P508
select how these signals are managed: through connector P503 or through USB
interface, that is from the PC based user interface.

Table 1 and Table 2 present the position of the jumpers when connector P503 is
used and when the USB interface is used:

**Table 1. SPI Pin Management Settings at Connector P507**

======= ================ ===============

P512 Connector
--------------

A generic FPGA or a microcontroller can interface with the AD9546 through
connector P512 that provides access to all SPI pins of the AD9546. See board
schematics for details.

EEPROMs
-------

The AD9546 Evaluation Board contains two EEPROMS:

-  CYUSB EEPROM (U503) that is used in conjunction with the USB communication
-  PI EEPROM (U508) that is used when a Rasberry PI 3 Model B+ is connected at
   P503 connector

To protect the EEPROMs from being overwritten, place jumpers at P502 and P506
connectors. To make sure the CYUSB EEPROM is enabled, place jumper at P501
connector. To program the CYUSB EEPROM:

-  take out the jumper P502 to enable the operation
-  take out jumpers P504 and P505 to disable the I2C bus accessing the PI EEPROM
-  use the available programming tool.

To program the PI EEPROM, take out the jumper P506 to enable the operation and
use the available programming tool.

Control Pins
------------

The control pins M0 - M6 may be managed in several ways on the on the AD9546
Evaluation Board:

-  through the Evaluation Software using the USB connection
-  M0, M1, M2 and M3 through connector P503
-  through the jumpers at the P601 and P602 connectors as shown in Table 3
-  through the SMA connectors J601, J602, J603, J604, J605, J606, and J607

**Table 3. M0 - M6 Pins Access**

============ ========= =========== =====
Control Pins Connector P601 Jumper 
============ ========= =========== =====
\                      High        Low
M0           J601      2-1         2-3
M1           J602      5-4         5-6
M2           J603      8-7         8-9
M3           J604      11-10       11-12
\                      P602 Jumper

M6           J607      8-7         8-9
============ ========= =========== =====

Note that M5 and M6 pins are multiplexed with the SPI pins SDO and,
respectively, CSB. The default board settings enable the SPI functionality, so
the M5 and M6 pins are not usable.

The 0 Ω resistors R608, R657, RT658, R659, R660, R661 and R662 connect the Mx,
x=0 to 6, signals from connectors J601, J602, J603, J604, J605, J606 and J607 to
U602 level shifter. Unsolder them when the Mx pins are used as auxiliary
references and a clean path towards the AD9546 is necessary.

AD9546 EVALUATION SOFTWARE
--------------------------

The AD9546 evaluation board is supported by Windows® based software that allows the user to access all the functionality of the AD9546. The software communicates with the board using the USB. On the evaluation board, the CY7C68013A USB microcontroller then communicates with the :adi:`AD9546` to process the requests that are sent from the PC. The evaluation software uses only the 3-wire SPI communication to communicate with the :adi:`AD9546`. The 4-wire SPI and I2C communications are not supported.

Installing the AD9546 Evaluation Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the AD9546 Evaluation Software from the :adi:`AD9546 Evaluation Board Website <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ad9546.html>`, unzip it and run the executable.
