ADI OCP ORV3 BBU Reference Design
=================================

Overview
--------

This reference design shares an overview about the Analog Devices' proprietary
solution for the OCP ORV3 Battery Back-up Unit reference design, leveraging the
company's array of resources, including power converters, controllers, power and
battery management products, microcontrollers, high-performance supervisors, and
more. The webpage will offer a brief summary and explanation of a battery backup
unit, outlining its application in data center scenarios.

What is OCP?
------------

The **Open Compute Project**, abbreviated as **OCP**, is an organization that facilitates the sharing of designs and best practices for data center products among various companies, including Meta, IBM, Intel, Google, Microsoft, HP, Nokia, and more. OCP originated internally at Facebook HQ as **"Project Freedom"** in 2009.

BBU Specification
-----------------

What is a Battery Back-up Unit?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1| Designed for deployment on a BBU Shelf within a data center rack, a **Battery Back-up Unit (BBU)** serves the purpose of supplying DC power to system loads in the event of sudden power interruptions. OCP has established a set of design requirements and specifications for the BBU reference design standard.

As an illustration, a key requirement for an individual BBU module is its ability to deliver a **backup power of 3kW** for a duration of 4 minutes and a **charging power of 250W** over a period ranging from three to six hours.

Battery Back-up Unit (BBU Shelf)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  5+1 redundant backplane power
-  Up to 18kW DC power to the system backplane
-  4 minutes of full power delivery

Block Diagram
-------------

The block diagram comprises of the main power converter, :adi:`LT8228`, functioning as a bidirectional controller for the BBU's charging and discharging processes. Additionally, to augment the backup power available during battery discharging, the power converter design incorporates the multiphase expander, :adi:`LT8551`. The combined operation of **LT8228** and **LT8551** enhances the backup **discharging power** to **3kW** and the **charging power** to **250W**.

To serve as the battery management system device for the BBU, :adi:`ADBMS6948` has been introduced. Paired with its dedicated microcontroller, :adi:`MAX32625`, it has the capability to provide comprehensive routine maintenance and monitoring of the BBU's battery stack.

With regards to power system and fault monitoring, the power management IC, :adi:`LTC2971`, was employed in conjunction with :adi:`MAX32690`, acting as the primary microcontroller and brain of the BBU. **MAX32690** is responsible for logic control, communications, housekeeping, and fault handling within the BBU.

Graphical User Interface
------------------------

A graphical user interface has been created to offer a visual logical sequence
of operations for the device, ensuring a meticulously planned execution of
housekeeping and protection tasks. The GUI also plays a pivotal role in
facilitating well-organized and object-oriented monitoring, reading, and
providing easy access for customers.

The graphical user interface (GUI) for the BBU module is divided into various
sections, each offering crucial information to the user. The following details
the functions of each section:

-   Module operation status indicator
-   Module internal temperature readings
-   Module fault indicator table
-   Fan speed indicator (in rpm)
-   Power Converter metrics information
-   Cells information (voltage and temperature)

The GUI only allows the display of one module at a time, and users have the
flexibility to select which specific module's data they want to view on the
interface.
