INSTALLATION OPTIONS
--------------------

Microsoft® .NET Framework must be installed for the evaluation board software to run properly. Analog Devices Inc. provides both a web installer and full installer for evaluation software which can be downloaded from a specific product evaluation board page links located in the **Supported Products** section. The full installer is a larger file, which has Microsoft® .NET Framework embedded in the installer. The web installer is a smaller file which relies on an internet connection to download and install Microsoft® .NET Framework. Both installers will first check the user's machine to see if Microsoft® .NET Framework needs to be installed or updated.

Running the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The evaluation software can be used with or without an evaluation board. Using the software without an evaluation board is useful for creating or verifying register settings for a given PLL setup without needing any hardware. When using the software with an evaluation board, power up and connect the board to the PC prior to starting the evaluation software. The evaluation board hardware is detailed on the evaluation boards specific product page in the **Evaluation Board Hardware** section.

-  Double-click appropriate AD95xx Evaluation Software icon to run the evaluation software. If the evaluation board was properly found by the software, the lower left hand corner of the Main Window (shown in **Figure 1**) will read "AD95xx Evaluation Board \| SPI 3 -wire" in green. If the evaluation board was not found, the lower left hand corner of the screen will read "No Hardware Connected!" in red.
-  If the evaluation board is found, proceed to the **Evaluation Software Components** section for details about using the software. If the evaluation board is not found, click **File > Select Hardware**. Select the appropriate evaluation board connected and press OK. The select hardware window is shown in **Figure 12**.

   -  The bottom left corner of the main window should now read "AD95xx
      Evaluation Board \| SPI 3 -wire" in green.

See the individual product wikis for detailed information about specific device
software.

TABS

This section describes the selectable tabs within the evaluation software GUI.

Block Diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Block Diagram** tab features the main interactive GUI interface as shown in **Figure 1**. This tab is also referred to as the **GUI Main Window**. Many blocks and sub windows are accessible through this tab.

Frequency Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Frequency Limits** tab features specification limit excerpts from the individual product datasheet. These limits are used by the GUI block diagram to display if any frequency limits are being violated by the current user configuration. Please refer to the product datasheet for limit verification.

EXPLANATION OF GUI FEATURES
---------------------------

Tool Tips
~~~~~~~~~

The clock evaluation software incorporates **Tool Tips** to all interactive blocks, pins, wires, buttons, check boxes and indicators. These **Tool Tips** give the user active feedback of the state of a component, the limits of a component, and instruction about how to interact with the component if applicable. **Tool Tips** are brought up by simply hovering the cursor over a component of interest. The images below show examples of **Tool Tips** when hovering over a reference divider block, wire, and VCO.

   *Figure 4. Various Tool Tip Examples*

Latching Values Into Interactive Blocks and Text Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Values may be entered into a block or text field by clicking the appropriate item. When a block/text field is selected, a blue outline and cursor appears as shown in **Figure 5**. All items which require text input from the user require an **Enter** keystroke to latch the value into the software. If an evaluation board is connected, a change to a block's value followed by an **Enter** keystroke will automatically load the value into the active registers of the device. Text fields within child windows require for the **Load** button to be pressed for any text values to be loaded into the device.

Automatic loading of user inputs can be disabled by unchecking the **Enable Auto IO Update** option within the **File**>\ **Options** menu.

.. container:: centeralign

   ..

   *Figure 5. Selecting a Block To Edit Text*

Highlighted and Grayed Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various blocks within the GUI are represented as active by highlighting the block(white background). A block that is inactive is represented by graying the block and text. Blocks that are able to be activated and deactivated are done so by simply clicking the block. If an evaluation board is connected and a block is deactivated within the GUI, the appropriate register settings are automatically written to the active registers of the device by default. **Figure 5** below shows four reference inputs, with only RefA and RefC active.

Automatic loading of user inputs can be disabled by unchecking the **Enable Auto IO Update** option within the **File**>\ **Options** menu.

Active Frequency Calculation and Frequency Violation Indication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The interactive GUI within the **Block Diagram** tab allows the user to configure the product to many valid functioning and non functioning states. The GUI uses the independent variable information contained in each block's state and text box to calculate dependent frequencies throughout the device. The GUI actively monitors and displays when a device frequency specification is being violated by highlighting the unsupported component in red. Errors are also displayed when when reference and feedback frequencies are not matched for a given PLL. **Figure 7** below shows a user configuration with many frequency errors.

Frequency Limits Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Frequency violations are also highlighted red in the **Frequency Limits** tab. **Figure 8** shows an example of a maximum VCO frequency violation.

VCO Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A VCO calibration is issued by clicking on a VCO block within the GUI.

Expansion Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Expansion Windows** are used to display small sections of a part at a time. Expansion windows allow the user to switch between multiple PLL channels or output banks for devices with large output distribution. Each window uses a different background color to represent a different section of the device. Selecting an **Expansion Window** does not reconfigure the device or alter blocks contained in other expansion windows. **Figure 9** shows the **Expansion Window** buttons for the AD9554 which allow the user to select one of four channels.
