ADS10-V1EBZ HIGH SPEED CARRIER CARD
===================================

Preface
-------

The :adi:`ADS10-V1EBZ <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADS10-V1EBZ.html>` Carrier Card was developed to support the evaluation of Analog Devices High Speed Data Converters with serial line rates up to 32.5Gbps. This Wiki site provides a high level overview of the platform. The ADS10-V1 is intended to be used only with specified Analog Devices Evaluation Boards. The ADS10-V1 is not intended to be used as a general purpose development platform, and no support is available for standalone operation. The ADS10-V1 may contain hardware features that are not fully productized or supported by our default customer evaluation configurations. Please refer to Xilinx and its approved distributors for general purpose FPGA Development Kits if needed.

Using the ADS10-V1EBZ to evaluate High Speed Converters
=======================================================

Overview
--------

When connected to a specified Analog Devices high speed converter evaluation
board, the ADS10-V1EBZ works as a data generation and acquisition board.
Designed to support the highest speed JESD204B/C converters, the FPGA on the
ADS10-V1EBZ acts as the data and control interface. An example test setup is
shown below.
