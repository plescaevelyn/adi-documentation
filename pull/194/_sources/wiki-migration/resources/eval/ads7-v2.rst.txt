ADS7-V2EBZ HIGH SPEED EVALUATION BOARD
======================================

Preface
-------

The :adi:`ADS7-V2 <en/content/CU_High-Speed_ADC_FIFO_evaluation_tools/fca.html#ADS7-V2>` Evaluation Board was developed to support the evaluation of Analog Devices high speed A/D converters, D/A converters and Transceivers with JESD204B bit rates up to 12.5 Gbps. This Wiki site provides a high level overview of the platform. In addition, each use case of the board has its own section (e.g. Using the ADS7-V2 for High Speed A/D Converter Evaluation). The ADS7-V2 is intended to be used only with specified Analog Devices Evaluation Boards. The ADS7-V2 is not intended to be used as a development platform, and no support is available for standalone operation. Please refer to Xilinx and its approved distributors for FPGA Development Kits.

Additional DAC specific :adi:`ADS7-V2 <en/content/CU_High-Speed_ADC_FIFO_evaluation_tools/fca.html#ADS7-V2>` Applications Support is available at :doc:`/wiki-migration/resources/eval/dpg/ads7`

Using the ADS7-V2EBZ to evaluate High Speed A/D Converters
==========================================================

Overview
--------

When connected to a specified Analog Devices high speed adc evaluation board, the ADS7-V2 works as a data acquistion board. Designed to support the highest speed JESD204B A/D Converters, the FPGA on the ADS7-V2 acts as the data receiver, while the ADC is the data transmitter. A typical test setup is shown below.
