Evaluating the Watch
--------------------

Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~

Dashboard is the page where the user can see the sensors that are supported by
the device. In dashboard, the app will display the result of the sensors.
Dashboard supports the following sensors PPG, ECG, EDA, Temperature, ADPD led
Green/Red/IR/Blue. Dashboard also supports the user to connect to the reference
watches.

Start Sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Once the watch is connected, User can start the sensor by clicking on the switch to ON side
-  Once the sensor is started, it will display the result of the sensor on that dashboard

-  If the users wants to see the logging data, they can start the sensor in dashboard and can view real-time plots in chart page.
-  If user wants to stop the log, they can simply click on the stop log button.

Multi-View Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Multiview logging, there are use cases in which each sensor is configured
with different sample rate. The logging of each sensor will be saved with those
configuration setting.
