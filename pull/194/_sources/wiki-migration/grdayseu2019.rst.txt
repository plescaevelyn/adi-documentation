European GNU Radio Days 2019 Workshops
======================================

For those attending the :adi:`PlutoSDR` workshop at European GNU Radio Days 2019, hosted by `ADI <https://www.analog.com/>`_, thanks. In order to make your experience better (less installing software while others are using the hardware) please have the following software installed on your machine:

-  **libIIO library:**

   -  Packages for Linux and Windows are available here: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases/latest
   -  Source available here: :git-libiio:`libiio`. If you want to build from source, feel free; master works fine.
   -  Documentation: :doc:`What is libiio? </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio>`

-  **libad9361-iio library**

   -  for linux users only, you will need the :git-libad9361-iio:`libad9361-iio` library.
   -  Instructions for building it are :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms5-ebz/multi-chip-sync>`.

-  **IIO-Scope:**

   -  Windows installers are available here: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope/releases
   -  Linux users will need to build from source: :git-iio-oscilloscope:`iio-oscilloscope`. Build instructions are :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`. You can skip the build of libiio and libad9361-iio steps, since you already did that.
   -  Documentation: :doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`

-  **GNU Radio with IIO support:**

   -  A prebuilt binary for Windows users is available here: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/3cigr6q3sb6tb7li/artifacts/gnuradio_3_7_11_iiosupport.msi

      -  If you need the Windows version of GNU Radio, you likely need the Windows driver from https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases/latest.

   -  Installation instructions for Linux users are here: :doc:`GNU Radio </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/gnuradio>`

If you run into any questions while downloading, or building, please ask on the Pluto Support Forum at ADI's :ez:`Engineerzone <university-program>`, where all workshop developers answer questions .
