Using the wall adaptor to power up camera
-----------------------------------------

It is possible to power up the camera by using an external wall adaptor. As long
as the cable has USB-C on one side and the wall adaptor can support at least 5W.

In this case the USB-C cable cannot be used to transfer data over to the PC. The user will have to communicate through an IX ethernet cable as the one shown below: - https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/harting/33480147826020/14556483

Setup as follows:

-  Connect wall adaptor with USB-C cable to power outlet and camera
-  Connect IX ethernet cable to router and camera

-  Ensure your laptop is connected to router (WIFI or Ethernet is okay)

   -  Please note there will be frame drops by using WIFI or Ethernet in
      comparison to USB-C

-  Find IP address of camera (Multiple options)

   -  Connect to router and find IP address of camera (192.168.0.1 can usually take you to your router menu)
   -  Connect to NXP via micro-USB cable and get ip address

      -  For instructions please check :doc:`Connecting to adtf-3175x </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adtf3175x-access>`
      -  Once logged in run 'ip addr' command and find IP address as shown in
         red below. In this case the IP address is 192.168.0.101
