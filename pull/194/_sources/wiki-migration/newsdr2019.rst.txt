Software-Defined Radio Workshops
================================

For those attending the PlutoSDR workshop at `NewSDR <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/newsdr-hands-on-session-with-the-pluto-sdr-tickets-61166067354>`_, hosted by Analog Devices, in order to make your experience better (less installing software while others are using the hardware) please have the following software installed on your machine:

Please install libIIO, libad9361, and IIO-Scope based on your operating system:

-  **Windows**

   -  **The** :git-plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win:`PlutoSDR driver <releases>` is available here: :git-plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win:`PlutoSDR-USB-Drivers.exe <releases/download/v0.7/PlutoSDR-M2k-USB-Drivers.exe>`
   -  **The** :git-libiio:`libiio <releases/latest>` **Library** : :git-libiio:`Windows-setup.exe <releases/download/v0.18/libiio-0.18.g4e22517-Windows-setup.exe>`
   -  :git-iio-oscilloscope:`IIO-Scope <releases>` : :git-iio-oscilloscope:`OSC-setup.exe <releases/download/v0.10-master/adi-osc-setup.exe>`

-  **Linux**

   -  **The** :git-libiio:`libiio <releases/latest>` **Library** : Pick your Linux distribution from the list :git-libiio:`here <releases/latest>`.

      -  Source available here: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio. If you want to build from source, feel free; master works fine.

   -  **libad9361-iio library** : You will need the https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libad9361-iio library.

      -  Instructions for building it are :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms5-ebz/multi-chip-sync>`.

   -  **IIO-Scope:** Linux users will need to build from `source <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope>`_. Build instructions are :doc:`here </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`. You can skip the build of libiio and libad9361-iio steps, since you already did that.

-  **MAC**

   -  **The** :git-libiio:`libiio <releases/latest>` **Library** : Select the PKG closest to your version of macOS. :git-libiio:`High Sierra 10.13.6 <releases/download/v0.17/libiio-0.17.g5bdc242-darwin-10.13.6.pkg>` or :git-libiio:`Sierra 10.12.6 <releases/download/v0.17/libiio-0.17.g5bdc242-darwin-10.12.6.pkg>`
   -  **The** :git-libiio:`libad9361 <releases/latest>` **Library** : :git-libad9361-iio:`macOS Version <releases/download/v0.2/libad9361-0.2.pkg>`
   -  **IIO-Scope:** use brew. ``brew install tfcollins/homebrew-formulae/i-i-o-oscilloscope``

Additionally, the instructions for installing RF Blockset Models for Analog Devices RF Transceivers can be found `here <https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/rfblkset_mdls_install>`_.

**Documentation**:

-  :doc:`What is libiio? </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio>`
-  Documentation: :doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </wiki-migration/resources/tools-software/linux-software/iio_oscilloscope>`

If you would like to come by the earlier in the evening before 6pm, and check out things with your hardware, it would be appreciated.

If you run into any questions while downloading, or building, please ask on the Pluto Support Forum at ADI's :ez:`Engineerzone <university-program>`, where all workshop developers answer questions .

Optional
