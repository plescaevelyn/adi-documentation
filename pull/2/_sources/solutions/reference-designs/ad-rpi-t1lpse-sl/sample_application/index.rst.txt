Temperature Controller Application
==================================

This sample application demonstrates a basic Temperature Controller using the
:adi:`AD-AD-RPI-T1LPSE-SL-RPIZ` board, two :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` boards, a
Raspberry Pi, a fan actuator and a temperature sensor. The system reads
temperature data and adjusts fan speed (via SWIOT1L output) based on
configurable thresholds and hysteresis.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 3.8 or newer (3.8–3.11 tested with pyadi-iio). Ensure that a
  compatible version is installed on your system before continuing. Older
  versions (<3.8) may not work reliably with pyadi-iio.

- Git command-line tools installed.

- Raspberry Pi with :adi:`Kuiper 2` image installed. Follow the instructions in
  the :external+adi-kuiper-gen:doc:`index` documentation to prepare the
  Raspberry Pi.

- Ensure that the first two **Software Setup** steps described in
  :ref:`software-setup` (*Downloading and Flashing the Micro-SD Card* and
  *Configuring the Micro-SD Card*) are performed **with the Kuiper 2 image**,
  not with previous Kuiper releases. These steps must be redone after flashing
  Kuiper 2 to ensure proper compatibility before continuing.

   Temperature Controller System

**Equipment Needed**

- 1x :adi:`AD-AD-RPI-T1LPSE-SL-RPIZ` Board
- 2x :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` Boards
- 1x Raspberry Pi 4 Model B running Kuiper 2
- 1x :adi:`TMP01` Temperature Sensor
- 1x MC002103 DC Axial Fan
- 1x Raspberry Pi USB Type-C Power Supply (5V, 3A)

**Setup Procedure**

1. Connect the :adi:`AD-AD-RPI-T1LPSE-SL-RPIZ` board to the Raspberry Pi via the
   40-pin header

2. Connect the two :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` boards to the
   :adi:`AD-AD-RPI-T1LPSE-SL-RPIZ` board via the T1L connectors

3. Connect the first :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` board to the :adi:`TMP01` temperature
   sensor

   The first SWIOT1L-SL board is used to both power the TMP01 sensor and
   measure its analog output voltage (VPTAT), which encodes the temperature.

   - **Channel 3 (CH3)** is configured as a **Voltage Output** and provides
     the sensor supply voltage. Connect:

     - ``CH3 SWIO`` → ``TMP01 V+``
     - ``CH3 GND`` → ``TMP01 GND``

   - **Channel 4 (CH4)** is configured as a **Voltage Input** to measure the
     TMP01 analog output. Connect:

     - ``CH4 SWIO`` → ``TMP01 VOUT``
     - ``CH4 GND`` → ``TMP01 GND``

   .. note::

      CH3 provides a regulated 5 V supply to power the TMP01, while CH4 is
      configured as a high-impedance voltage input with a 0–5 V range to measure
      the TMP01 VOUT signal. Both channels must share the same ground reference
      with the sensor.

4. Connect the second :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` board to the fan actuator

   The second SWIOT1L-SL board drives the fan according to the control loop.

   - The fan is powered directly from channel 0, configured as a
     **Voltage Output**:

     - ``CH0 SWIO`` → ``Fan +``
     - ``CH0 GND`` → ``Fan −``

   - Connect the tachometer output to channel 1 to monitor fan speed (optional):

     - ``CH1 SWIO`` → ``Fan Tach Out``

5. Power the Raspberry Pi with a 5V, 3A USB Type-C power supply.


Software Setup
--------------

Repository Cloning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clone the repository and checkout the *swiot* branch:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio.git
      $ cd pyadi-iio
      $ git checkout swiot

2. Install Python dependencies:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ python3 -m venv ./venv
      $ source venv/bin/activate
      $ pip install -e .


Firmware Flashing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` must be updated with the provided firmware image.

1. Follow the official update instructions here:
   `Updating the AD-SWIOT1L-SL firmware <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/documentation/solutions/reference-designs/ad-swiot1l-sl/software-guide/index.html#updating-the-ad-swiot1l-sl-firmware>`_.

2. Repeat the process for **both boards**.

3. Use the firmware images provided below. These images configure the boards with
   static IP addresses:

   - The first board will have the ``192.168.97.40`` IP address
   - The second board will have the ``192.168.97.41`` IP address

   .. ADMONITION:: Download

      :download:`Firmware for temperature controller application <swiot1l_firmware.zip>`

   Four different firmware images are provided. We recommend using the ones
   mentioned above. You may use the other two images if you wish to change the
   IP addresses of the boards or to extend the application.


Network Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Raspberry Pi has two Ethernet interfaces connected to the two
:adi:`AD-SWIOT1L-SL` boards. We will create two persistent NetworkManager
connections with autoconnect enabled for each interface in order to communicate
with the boards:

- ``eth1`` will use ``192.168.97.30/32`` and route to the SWIOT1L board at ``192.168.97.41``
- ``eth2`` will use ``192.168.97.31/32`` and route to the SWIOT1L board at ``192.168.97.40``

Open the terminal and run the following commands.

1. Add the wired connection interfaces:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ sudo nmcli connection add \
          type ethernet \
          ifname eth1 \
          con-name "Wired connection 2" \
          ipv4.method manual \
          ipv4.addresses 192.168.97.30/32 \
          ipv4.routes "192.168.97.41/32" \
          ipv6.method disabled \
          connection.autoconnect yes

      $ sudo nmcli connection add \
          type ethernet \
          ifname eth2 \
          con-name "Wired connection 3" \
          ipv4.method manual \
          ipv4.addresses 192.168.97.31/32 \
          ipv4.routes "192.168.97.40/32" \
          ipv6.method disabled \
          connection.autoconnect yes

2. Activate the new connections:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 2"
      $ sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 3"

3. Reboot the Raspberry Pi to ensure autoconnect is applied:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ sudo reboot

4. Verify that the new connections are active:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ nmcli connection show

      Example of active NetworkManager connections

5. Verify routing and connectivity to the boards:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ ip route
      $ ping 192.168.97.40
      $ ping 192.168.97.41


Application Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When executed, the demo continuously reads the temperature from the :adi:`TMP01`
sensor and compares it against the configured thresholds. The fan is
automatically turned **ON** once the temperature rises above ``TEMP_ON``
(default 27 °C) and turned **OFF** once the temperature falls below
``TEMP_OFF`` (default 26 °C). This hysteresis prevents rapid switching when the
temperature hovers around the threshold.

During runtime, the application prints sensor readings and fan state in the
console, and displays two plots:

- **Temperature vs Time** — TMP01 and ADT75 temperature measurements with ON/OFF
  thresholds.
- **Fan State vs Time** — graphical representation of when the fan is active.

The application accepts optional command-line arguments to override the default
IP addresses of the temperature sensor board and the fan control board. If no
arguments are provided, the application falls back to the default IP addresses
defined in the script.

Run the Temperature Controller example using the default configuration:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ cd examples/rpi_t1lpse
      $ python3 temperature_controller.py

To explicitly specify the board IP addresses:

   .. shell::
      :user: analog
      :group: analog
      :show-user:

      $ python3 temperature_controller.py \
          --temp-ip 192.168.97.41 \
          --fan-ip 192.168.97.40
