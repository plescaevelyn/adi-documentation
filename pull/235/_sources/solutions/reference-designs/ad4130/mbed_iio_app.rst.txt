Configure/Access Device Attributes (Parameters)
-----------------------------------------------

The IIO Oscilloscope allows user to access and configure different device
parameters, called as 'Device Attributes“. There are 2 types of attributes:

-  Device Attributes (Global): Access/Configure common device parameters.
-  Channel Attributes (Specific to channels): Access/Configure channel specific
   device parameters.

How to read and write attribute:

-  To 'Read' an attribute, simply select the attribute from a list or press 'Read' button on left side.
-  To 'Write' an attribute, select attribute value in the 'value field' and
   press 'Write' button.

Using DMM Tab to Read DC Voltage on Input Channels
--------------------------------------------------

DMM tab can be used read the instantaneous voltage applied on analog input
channels. Simply select the device and channels to read and press start button.

*\*Note: The voltage is just instantaneous, so it is not possible to get RMS AC voltage or averaged DC voltage. Also, when using DMM tab, do not access/use the Data Capture or Debug tab as this could impact data capturing. Both DMM scan and data capture uses different methods of conversion. The DMM data is read using single conversion, while data capture uses continuous conversion mode of operation.*

Data Capture from IIO Device
----------------------------

To capture the data from AD4130 IIO device, simply select the device and
channels to read/capture data. The data is plotted as “ADC Raw Value” Vs “Number
of Samples” and is just used for Visualization. The data is read as is from
device without any processing. If user wants to process the data, it must be
done externally by capturing data from the Serial link on controller board.

*\*Note: The DMM or Debug tab should not be accessed when capturing data as this would impact data capturing. Both DMM scan and data capture uses different methods of conversion. The DMM data is read using single conversion, while data capture uses continuous conversion mode of operation.*

More info here: `Data Capture using IIO App <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/product-support-software/data-capture-using-iio-app>`_

Data capturing utilizes two modes:

-  Normal sequencer: In this mode, the channel for which data to be captured are
   enabled and automatically added into a sequencer. The sequencer operates in
   the continuous conversion mode. After each conversion, an interrupt signal
   attached to configured INT source is triggered and conversion result is read
   into a internal acquisition buffer.

-  FIFO mode: This mode uses the internal FIFO of device to store the ADC
   samples. The conversion happens in continuous conversion mode and an
   interrupt signal attached to configured INT source is triggered when internal
   FIFO becomes full (reached to watermark limit). The data from FIFO is read
   periodically when FIFO is made available by device. The FIFO is operated in
   ‘Oldest Save’ mode as there must be enough time provided to read the FIFO
   after it becomes full. If FIFO is operated into streaming mode, the previous
   data could get overwritten before it is being acquired by the firmware.

Time Domain Plot
----------------

*\*Note: Due to low sampling rate (50SPS) for temperature sensor measurement, select 50 or less samples during data capturing for sensor demo mode channels.*

Frequency Domain Plot
---------------------

*\*Note: Max 4096 samples can be selected for plotting frequency domain response due to limited buffer size in the firmware.*

Python Environment and Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data capture, sensor measurement, device calibration, etc. can be achieved with
python based IIO clients, using 'pyadi-iio' library. A possible option using
ADI's pyadi-iio library in python has been demonstrated in the forthcoming
sections. The python scripts are provided along with firmware package.

Sensor Demo Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AD4130 IIO firmware provides support for interfacing different sensors to analog
inputs and perform the measurement on them. Below sensor demo modes are
supported in the firmware.

-  User Default Config (All channels test)
-  2-wire/3-wire/4-wire RTD (Default is PT100)
-  Thermistor (Default is 10K NTC)
-  Thermocouple (Default is T type TC and PT1000 RTD as CJC)
-  Load Cell (4-wire bridge)
-  Noise Test (AIN0-AIN1 shorted)
-  ECG
-  Power Test (ADC internal channels voltage/current measurement)

*\*Note: The selection of default sensor types can be changed from ‘ad4130_temperature_sensor.cpp’ file to large extent and from respective user config header files to some extent.*

Demo Mode Selection
-------------------

The sensor mode selection is done from “app_config.h” file using
“ACTIVE_DEMO_MODE_CONFIG” macro. The selection is done at compilation time, that
means only one sensor demo mode is active at a time. Whenever demo mode is
changed from app_config.h file, the code must be compiled again to generate a
new binary file for that.

Demo Mode User Configuration
----------------------------

Firmware maintains the unique user configuration file for each sensor demo mode
as per below table. The configurations can be updated by using .c and .h user
config files.

   :width: 600

Sensor Measurement
------------------

Sensor measurement for RTD, Thermistor, Thermocouple, Noise Test, ECG, Power
Test and User Default Config can be done using the IIO oscilloscope GUI client
application or by executing python scripts from the ‘scripts’ folder.
Temperature result for RTD, TC and Thermistor would be in degree Celsius. The
result for other configs would in voltage/current.

Sensor measurement for Load Cell can be done by executing the python script
available in the project “scripts” folder. IIO oscilloscope can only support
measurement for voltage, current and temperature quantities and threfore python
code is developed to support measurement for other sensor types.

The python script can be executed from ‘Visual Studio Code’ or any other
preferred IDE/console prompt application using “python script_name.py” command
as shown below. The demo config is fetched from the firmware by establishing
serial (UART/VCOM) connection between host and MCU (sdp-k1). Refer next section
to install necessary python tools and updating/executing the python scripts.

Sensor Channels Calibration
---------------------------

It is possible to calibrate the device channels which are connected to external
sensors. The sensors calibration (gain and offset) is done by executing the
python script “ad4130_calibration.py”.

-  Select data capture mode (Continuous, Burst, FIFO).
-  Select UART/VCOM (only for SDP-K1).

ad4130_user_config.c
--------------------

This file defines the user configurations for the AD4130, such as SPI parameters
(frequency, mode, etc) and other init parameters used by No-OS drivers to
initialize AD4130 device (e.g. required GPIOs, software/hardware mode, etc).
These are the parameters loaded into device when device is powered-up or
power-cycled.

ad4130_data_capture.c
---------------------

This file implements the data capturing logic for the AD4130 device. The data
capturing can be done using normal ‘Sequencer’ Or using internal ‘FIFO’. Enable
the macro ‘FIFO_ENABLED’ for enabling FIFO mode.

ad4130_iio.c
------------

This file defines getter/setter functions for all the device and channel
specific attributes (related to AD4130 devices) to read/write the device
parameters. The majority of device specific functionality is present in this
module.

No-OS Drivers for AD4130
------------------------

The no-os drivers provide the high level abstracted layer for digital interface
of AD4130 devices. The complete digital interface (to access memory map and
perform data read) is done in integration with platform drivers. The
functionality related with no-os drivers is covered in below 2 files:

-  ad413x.c
-  ad413x.h
