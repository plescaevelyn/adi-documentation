To use the :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO` Active Learning Module, you have:

RF Connectors
-------------

* 2 RF `SMA connectors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector>`_ [1]_
  to connect to instrumentation or antennas

  * Transmit (labeled 'Tx')
  * Receive (labeled 'Rx')
  * 300 MHz - 3.8 GHz
  * 200 kHz - 20 MHz channel bandwidth

USB Connectivity
----------------

* USB for your host connectivity (used to stream data)

  * USB 2 (480 Mbits/second)
  * libiio USB device for communicating to the RF device
  * Network device

    * Remote Network Driver Interface Specification
      (`RNDIS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNDIS>`_)
    * This will enumerate with the ``192.168.2.1`` IP address by default.

  * USB serial device

    * "provides access to the Linux console on the Pluto device via USB
      Communication Device Class Abstract Control Model"
      (`USB CDC ACM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class>`_)

  * Mass storage device

    * this will appear to the host as a disk, where you can find links for
      software uploads, and the serial number of the device.

External Power
--------------

* External power

  * During Pluto design, potential consumption exceeded 5 unit loads for
    `USB 2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Power>`_ (500mA), so a backup
    power connector was added. Not necessary for nominal use.
  * An external adapter
    (like `this one from Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/products/1995>`_)
  * "We know the 'Power' icon is the 'on/off' icon, if you think that is
    confusing - please let us know."
