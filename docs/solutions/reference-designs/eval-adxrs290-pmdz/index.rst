Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-ADXRS290-PMDZ` is a simple Pmod form factor evaluation board for
the :adi:`ADXRS290`, a high-performance MEMS pitch-and-roll (dual-axis in-plane)
angular rate sensor (gyroscope) designed for use in stabilization applications.

The solution senses and digitizes the **X-axis** and **Y-axis** (also called
**roll** and **pitch**) angular rates, producing a positive reading for
clockwise rotation about the X-axis and Y-axis.

The :adi:`ADXRS290` provides an output full-scale range of ±100°/s with 
a sensitivity of 200 LSB/°/s. Its resonating disk sensor structure enables 
angular rate measurement about the axes normal to the sides of the package 
around an  in-plane axis. Angular rate data is formatted 
as a 16-bit two's complement and is accessible through an SPI digital interface. 
The ADXRS290 exhibits a low noise floor of 0.004°/s/√Hz and features programmable 
high-pass and lowpass filters.

The ADXRS290 communicates via 4-wire SPI and operates as a peripheral 
(subordinate) device, with a maximum clock frequency of 12 MHz.

The digital communication on the :adi:`EVAL-ADXRS290-PMDZ` is
accomplished using a standard expanded SPI PMOD port.
