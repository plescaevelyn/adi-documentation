.. important::

   Only the main EV-HT-200CDAQ1 board and the wiring harness of the harnesses of
   the breakout boards are rated for high temperature exposure. Do not place
   these accessory boards in the high temperature test environment

Overview of Software Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two main software components incorporated in this project the VA10800
ARM microcontroller firmware, and the Data Viewer host software.

All EV-HT-200CDAQ1 boards come with the microcontroller pre-programmed. The
latest firmware can be downloaded and built by downloading it from ADI's GitHub.
See the software download wiki page for further details. The firmware is
programmed with multiple, highly configurable modes of data acquisition.
Acquired data is sent to a PC via the UART interface.

The Data Viewer host software (and open source) can be downloaded from the
software download wiki page. This software communicates with the main board via
UART to control acquisition modes, display data, log data and run signal
analysis.

Component Placement Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The image below is a quick reference for main component placement on the main
board. Consult the schematic in the design package for more detailed

Hardware Setup and Check
------------------------

Prior to running the HT DAQ viewer software and measuring precision signals, it is recommended that the communication channels be checked ste-by-step using the minimum connection as described in the steps below. Refer to the diagram below for guidance on connections. PuTTY, free terminal software, is used in this hardware check. If you do not have this program installed, you can download it at http://www.putty.org.

.. image:: ../images/checkout.png

-  Connect the uphole interface board with 15-wire cable assembly to the
   EV-HT-200CDAQ1 board connector J1 using the included allen wrench.

.. important::

   It is best to alternate sides as the connectors are screwed together in order
   to apply even pressure across the rows of pins

-  Connect the downhole interface board with 21-wire cable assembly to the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 board connector J2 using the included allen wrench.
-  On the powers/comms breakout board, connect a 3.3V power supply to two connections on the uphole interface board: “3.3VIN” and “Vp”. Vp provides power to the analog portion of the board. Make a ground connection to the K9 turret, “DGND” and the K2 turret, “Vm”. Apply 3.3V. If you are able to monitor current through the supply, it should be around 45 mA.
-  Connect the USB cable between PC and the HT-DAB-1 uphole interface board. The PC should enumerate with the FTDI chip. If it does not, please go to the FTDI website (http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) and download the Windows drivers for FT232R.
-  Start a PuTTY terminal window,select baud rate = 2000000 (6 zeros) with handshaking = CTS/RTS. Choose the Communication Port. (To determine the COM port, start the Windows Device Manager and select “Ports (COM & LPT)”. If the USB interface on the Uphole board has enumerated, it will show up as a serial port.)
-  Enter “\ :math:`version” on the terminal window. If the MCU is powered, it will respond with firmware and MCU identification information. If no response is made when key strokes are entered, please double check the hardware and the COM port number.  * Enter “`\ gettemp” on the terminal window. If the analog portion is powered and working properly, you should get a message back with accurate temperature and VCC voltage measurement information. If the temperature or voltage do not make sense, the most likely cause is not having the analog supply provided.
-  Enter “\ :math:`setacq 40 255 80 255 5”. This will set the experiment to 255 samples of ch0 (4 microsecond conversion period.) and ch2 (8 microsecond conversion period).  * Enter “`\ single”. The terminal window should display sampling data for ch0 and ch2 with hexadecimal characters.

.. important::

   Connecting Vp to 3.3V and Vm to GND is the simplest connection, but does not
   give the highest performance signal acquisition. To achieve maximum
   performance from the analog front end, separate bipolar connections should be
   used with Vp=+5VDC and Vm=-2.5VDC. See the wiki section on hardware design
   notes for further information

Installing and Using HT DAQ Viewer
----------------------------------

HT DAQ Viewer is a Windows application that allows the user to connect, control,
view and log captured data from the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 reference design board. It
has advanced signal analysis functions built in including FFT, histogram, and
spectrum analysis to facilitate deep data examination. Source code for HT DAQ
Viewer in C# is available on the ADI GitHub, see the software download wiki page
for more information.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  PC running Windows 7 or 10
-  One free USB port
-  EV-HT-200CDAQ1 board connected and powered as described in section above

Installing the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HT DAQ Viewer is a “zero install” executable. Download the latest version of the
software from the software download wiki page. Unzip the archive in a directory
of your choice. Click on the “HT DAQ Viewer.exe” to run the program. If you want
to have a shortcut on your desktop or another folder, right click on the “HT DAQ
Viewer.exe” and select “create shortcut” and place this link where desired.

Connecting to the Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The board should be properly connected, and powered-ON as described in the
previous section. Connect the USB cable included in the kit from the PC to the
Power/Comm breakout board. The breakout board will instantiate as a COM port in
the Windows Device Manager as shown in the below diagram. Note the port number.

.. image:: ../images/devicemanager.png

Data Capture Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data is captured by the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 firmware in two different modes, **Burst Mode** or **Continuous Mode**.

In **Burst Mode**, the firmware allows for a high sample rate (minimum = 2.4 microseconds) capture for short intervals. Specific channels and rates are manually set. In **Continuous Mode**, all channels are sampled sequentially at a fixed sample period of approximately 10 microseconds, as shown in below diagram. A full sequence is conducted at a periodic rate set by the user. In both modes, data is transmitted over the UART interface to the HT DAQ Viewer for both display and analysis.

.. image:: ../images/continuousmode.png
   :align: center

Capturing Data in Burst Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In **Burst Mode**, the firmware will:

-  Acquire 8k samples data from the selected ADC channels.
-  Store the sample data (16 bits each) in an 16Kbyte buffer.
-   Transmit the buffer to the HT DAQ Viewer.

This process is done on either a **‘single shot’** or **‘periodic’** basis as specified by the user. Any combination of channels can be selected. The 16Kbyte buffer will be equally shared among selected channels as shown in the below table.

.. image:: ../images/sampletable.png
   :align: center

Channels 0 and 1 capture data simultaneously on ADC units 0 and 1. Channels 2 to
9 are multiplexed and will capture data sequentially on ADC unit 2. The
multiplexor and associated buffer require additional time for the signal to
settle before it can be accurately converted. When using more than one multiplex
channel, keep the sample rate above 4 microseconds. If only one mux channel is
selected, then there is no multiplexor switching action performed during the
burst acquisition on ADC unit 2 and the minimum sample period is 2.4
microseconds. ADC’s 0 and 1 samples are acquired first followed by ADC2. At the
end of each burst mode experiment channels 8 and 9 are sampled 4 times and
averaged for a VCC and RTD reading. ADC’s 0 and 1 are then acquired for the full
burst period followed by ADC2. An example timeline for a burst mode experiment
with multiple channels selected is shown below.

.. image:: ../images/burstmode.png
   :align: center

.. image:: ../images/bursttable.png
   :align: center

To execute a burst mode acquisition, set up the channel and period parameters
then click the “Start Acquisition” or “Single Shot” button. The following screen
captures are for an example acquiring a 1 kHz sine waveform on CH0 at 400ksps
for 8192 samples and repeating this every 2 seconds.

   :align: center

AC Analysis and Histogram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An AC Analysis and Histogram is automatically performed when only a single
channel is selected and “burst mode” is run. The figure below shows the results
for a 1 kHz sine wave.

.. image:: ../images/ac_analysis.png
   :align: center

AC Analysis Snapshot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While on the FFT Tab, you can use the Windows Copy (CTRL-C) to save a snapshot
of the AC analysis data into the Windows Clipboard. This data can then be Pasted
(CTRL-P) from the Windows Clipboard to an Excel spreadsheet or as text in a text
editor like Notepad. Shown is an example of 7 Copy and Paste actions into Excel
from the AC analysis window.

.. image:: ../images/ac_analysis_copypaste.png
   :align: center

Histogram
^^^^^^^^^

A histogram example from a 1 kHz sine wave is shown here.

.. image:: ../images/histogram.png
   :align: center

Capturing Data in Continuous Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Continuous mode will sequentially sample all channels (0 to 9) at the sample
period set in the “Sample Period” window. It is enabled by checking the Enabled
checkbox in the Continuous mode dialog box. The samples will commence when the
“Start Acquisition” box is clicked. The data is sent continuously to the HT DAQ
Viewer application for live display. All ten channels are acquired, but only
eight graphs are displayed as CH8 (VCC) and CH9 (RTD) are displayed on the left
pane as Board Temperature and VCC.

.. image:: ../images/continuous_table.png
   :align: center

External Trigger Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to conduct sampling when an external trigger signal is applied.
The channel setup is the same but the experiment period must be set to 0 and an
external signal applied to GPIOB14 on the analog breakout board. When the
trigger goes active, the selected ADC channels will be sampled. The delay from
the signal going active (high) before the first sample occurs will be under 20
microseconds.

Data Export to CSV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data captured from a single experiment can be exported to a CSV (comma
separated variable) file by clicking the “Export to CSV” button. Data format is
as shown in italics below. The first five lines contain experiment information.
The subsequent lines (>8k) have the conversion information in floating point
format with a trailing comma on each line.
