EV-HT-200CDAQ1 Overview
=======================

The EV-HT-200CDAQ1 is a complete system reference platform enabling precision
data acquisition and control in extreme temperatures up to 200°C. Based upon the
AD7981 analog-to-digital SAR converter, this reference design demonstrates a
full featured system with two high speed simultaneously sampled channels along
with 8 additional multiplexed channels suitable for covering the acquisition
requirements for many high temperature, harsh environment application such as
downhole oil and gas instrumentation. The data acquisition front end is
connected to the VORAGO Technologies VA10800 ARM® Cortex®-M0 based
microcontroller via multiple SPI ports. Once acquired, the data can be processed
locally or transmitted via a UART or optional RS485 communications interface. In
addition to the hardware, open source firmware uses FreeRTOS with optimized
drivers and a data acquisition protocol with multiple modes of operation. Open
source host software allows the users to connect to the board via UART to
control acquisition modes, view data, log data and perform signal analysis. This
platform is suitable as reference design, for rapid prototyping and lab testing
of high temperature instrumentation systems.
