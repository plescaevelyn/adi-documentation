EV-HT-200CDAQ1 Hardware Design Notes
====================================

:adi:`EV-HT-200CDAQ1 <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EV-HT-200CDAQ1.html>` builds on the :adi:`CN0365` analog front end reference design with the goal of providing a foundation for a high temperature, low power microcontroller-based data acquisition and control solution that meets the requirements for many downhole instrumentation and other high temperature applications. Based upon the AD7981 analog-to-digital SAR converter, this reference design demonstrates a full featured system with two high speed simultaneously sampled channels along with 8 additional multiplexed channels suitable for covering the acquisition requirements of a broad range of downhole tools (10 channels total). This analog front end is connected via SPI ports to the VA10800 ARM® Cortex®-M0 microcontroller from VORAGO Technologies, an Analog Devices Alliance Partner.

Once acquired, the data can be processed locally or transmitted via a UART or
optional RS485 communications interface. Other supporting components on the
board, including memory, clock, power and passives are all rated for high
temperature operation by their respective suppliers and verified to operate
reliably at 200°C or higher. The board layout, shown below, is approximately
11.4” long and 1.1” wide. This is a typical long-and-narrow form factor required
for instruments that must be mounted in oil drilling and exploration equipment.

Powering the EV-HT-200CDAQ1
---------------------------

Power and communications interface signals are provided on the Micro-D 15
connector J1. The EV-HT-200CDAQ1-Z has flexible power options, but for best
performance (comparable to the CN-0365 reference design) the board requires
three power rails:

   Note that these are nominal operating currents. Maximum current will be
   higher under different operating modes such as a flash programming cycle or
   high temperature conditions.

The system can be energized with other power configurations including 3.3 V only
single supply operation but at compromised DC and AC performance or input signal
range as headroom in the op-amps and multiplexer are reduced. These power modes
are not characterized here but one can refer to the ADR225, AD8534, AD7981, and
ADG798 data sheets for guidance.

There are two user configurable shunts that help facilitate alternate power
configurations:

An input power filter attenuates interference from power lines, 3.3VIN and Vp,
above 1700 Hz. It also attenuates conducted emissions from the digital
components. A 33 nF capacitor, and series 100 Ω resistor on 3.3VIN and Vp
terminate these lines so they don’t ring or oscillate in response to powerline
emissions. Power input Vm uses a 10 Ω resistor in the line as input filtering
element.

Analog Input Channel
--------------------

The design of the data acquisition channel for the EV-HT-200CDAQ1 is covered extensively by the\ :adi:`CN0365` application note. That design serves as the basis for the three ADC inputs on this platform, although some changes and optimizations were made, mostly in passive component selection, in order to address the form factor requirements of the board and extended reliable operation up to 200°C. The reference acquisition channel circuit is shown the schematic below. There are two “digital multiplexed” channels that each contain a complete data acquisition channel, similar to CN0365, that are capable of running at high sample rates. There is also an “analog multiplexed” channel that adds an ADG798 multiplexer in front of the inputs, optimized for lower throughput inputs. R1 and R3 provide a 1.25 V bias for the non-inverting input of U1, and prevent it from floating to the rail of the analog input if left open, or if the multiplexer is de-selected. R8 and R9 can be changed to increase the gain of U1. R4, R7, and C1 are the anti-aliasing filter, but they can be re-configured as an attenuator or alternate filter configuration. R5, R6, and C4 form the RC filter between the ADC driver and ADC input that limits the amount of out-of-band noise arriving at the ADC input and attenuates the kickback voltage from the switched capacitors in the ADC’s input.

   :align: center

All inputs provide a first order anti-aliasing filter consisting of a 249Ω and
2.7 nF RC filter with roll off at 237 kHz. This filter is set wide to
accommodate high sample rate applications, but can be lowered with component
changes for low sample rate applications using the provisions for attenuation
and RC filtering at each input. Analog input signals should limit the applied
voltage from ground to Vref (0V to 2.5V). The common-mode range of the AD8634
op-amps are specified at 300 mV above Vee, which will limit the input voltage
range for the case of powering the board with +3.3VDC single supply. No input
protection is provided internally on the board other than the 249Ω series
resistance on the anti-aliasing filter. Current should be limited to no more
than 5 mA if an over/under-voltage condition is expected. This includes
situations where the main board is unpowered but input signals are still driven.
External input protection diodes can be used, but should be applied carefully,
because the leakage noise of the diodes at 200 °C may dominate the entire
system.

All analog inputs are biased at ½ Vref by 100 kΩ voltage dividers, giving a 50
kΩ input resistance. This prevents un-connected inputs from floating away to the
rail when not in use and allows AC-coupled inputs to be configured by adding
only a series capacitor. Use a large value for this coupling capacitor, so its
reactance does not amplify input-noise current. The 100 kΩ dividers were chosen
over higher values to mitigate the effects of AD8634 input bias currents and
ADG798 pin leakage as a DC input error source at high temperature. The input
dividers form a resistor divider with the 249 Ω anti-aliasing filter which is an
additional source of DC error. These effects can be compensated for by applying
a scale correction factor in software.

This platform was designed to take advantage of several key features of the
AD7981 ADC. This 16-bit, 600kSPS converter is capable of greater than 85dB
typical SINAD and ±0.6 LSB typical INL with a 2.5V reference and no missing
codes. Greater than 90dB SINAD can be achieved with a 5V reference, although
that was not selected for this platform in order to maintain compatibility with
lower voltage systems. Because the ADC core automatically powers down between
conversion cycles, ADC power consumption automatically scales linearly with
throughput. This allows power savings to be realized when using the converter at
lower sampling rates.

One ADR225 voltage reference serves all three ADC. A 249Ω - 10ųF RC LPF network
is provided, one for each channel, to reduce noise inherent in the ADR225 low
power reference. Each channel is then buffered by an AD8634 going into the
AD7981 ADC channel. The 33 µF solid-tantalum rservoir capacitors on the 2.5 V
reference output buffers have been reduced in value from the original CN0365
design due to space constraints in the small form-factor PCB. Tantalum
capacitors were used for the reservoir caps due to the extreme size of ceramic
capacitors in large values.

Multiplexer Channel Measurements
--------------------------------

General Input Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Six of the eight multiplexer channels are brought to the connector and available
as general purpose inputs. Full sample rate is supported on this channel and in
the most trivial configuration a single channel can be used as another high
speed acquisition channel. In multiplexed operation mode, adequate settling time
needs to be provisioned depending on measurement accuracy requirements. For the
default input channel configuration a settling of 5 time constants corresponds
to a 3.3 ųs minimum sampling period.

Vcc Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vcc is sampled on multiplexer channel 7, with respect to Vref and thus
measurements that are ratio-metric to Vcc can be DC corrected.

RTD Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A 1 kΩ RTD has been provided, and is connected to multiplexer channel S8. It is
biased by two 1 kΩ resistors to Vref. The temperature-dependent voltage
developed across the RTD is multiplexed into the ADC. Software converts the
voltage to a temperature reading in degrees Celsius. RTD circuits has good
repeatability, which is the most important factor for sensor calibration.
However, accuracy will start deviating from true reading around 150°C. This is
attributable to ADG798 mux leakage at these temperatures. At 200°C the RTD has
sensitivity to leakage of 114nA / °C. The EV-HT-200CDAQ1-Z evaluation board
design trades off RTD accuracy in order to eliminate the cost and space of an
additional op-amp buffer in this design.

To mitigate the effects of mux leakage in a custom design several approaches can
be taken:

-  An andditional AD8634 op-amp buffer can be used between the RTD and the multiplexer to drive it with a low impedance source.
-  A low leakage multiplexer can be used to prevent bias errors. ADG5298 is pin compatible with ADG798, and because of the dielectrically isolated process has dramatically lower leakage current, but requires higher supply voltage.
-  An individual calibration can be performed to null the effect of mux leakage over temperature
-  Lower value resistors and RTD can be used at the cost of higher power
   consumption

PCB Layout and Assembly
-----------------------

The EV-HT-200CDAQ1-Z was designed as a relatively low cost platform capable of
serving as a serviceable evaluation and prototype platform and starting point
for a high temperature system level design. As an evaluation platform has been
tested at 200 °C operation 200 hours without failures or compromise to the
assembly. While the board builds on the CN0365 reference design, certain design
considerations are made to realize a practical multi-channel system that fits
into a downhole form factor. All selected components are rated by the respective
manufacturer for 200 °C operation unless otherwise indicated. Operating
reliability and lifetime is ultimately driven by process and materials such as
choice of solder, PCB substrate, conformal coatings, lead preparation, assembly
process, etc. Each customer must apply their own standards and qualification
parameters to consider a system qualified for their specific mission profile.

Capacitors
~~~~~~~~~~

C0G/NP0 dielectric capacitors are used for low value filtering and decoupling.
These dielectrics have a very flat coefficient over temperature and are
generally more tolerant to board flexing stresses. Small footprint 0805 or less
ceramics are used to minimize CTE mismatch between component and PCB.High
temperature Tantalum capacitors are chosen for bulk energy storage with tradeoff
considerations between footprint size and ESR.

Resistors
~~~~~~~~~

PATT series 0603 SMD footprints are the preferred choice but larger footprint
sizes and alternate series were chosen primarily dictated by value and wide
availability.

Inductors
~~~~~~~~~

Inductors were chosen for 200 °C operational rating and surface mount footprint.

Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~

The board is connectorized with 200 °C rated Micro-D’s which are common in the
downhole industry. To reduce signal crosstalk the shell of the connector can be
grounded to the PCB in the assembly to the pad provided. For applications where
the highest signal integrity and lowest crosstalk is required high temperature
specialty connectors (or no connector) should be utilized that incorporate
coaxial or shielded balanced inputs to minimize crosstalk.

Headers
~~~~~~~

A 250 °C rated Sullins IDC header is provided in the analog section to
facilitate probing or the addition of an interface daughter board in bench test
scenarios. A PCB mount female connector is available for the daughterboard
assembly, or alternatively high temperature ribbon cable assemblies are also
available.

Programming Sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The programming socket uses an array of 100 mil spaced brass/copper sockets,
factory rated for 125 °C, but are suitable for survivability under 200 °C
operation. Alternatively this PCB footprint will also accept a 5x2 IDC header in
place of the socket array.

PCB
~~~

The PCB form factor was chosen for suitability in downhole applications, long
and narrow, where circuit boards have to conform to the constraints of a
borehole. Circuit board material chosen was a high temperature halogen free
polyimide. 0.093” board thickness was specified for added rigidity and planarity
over standard 0.062” thickness boards. A nickel-gold surface finish is used,
where nickel provides a barrier that resists intermetallic growth, and gold
provides a good surface for solder joint bonding. At these increased thicknesses
a typical 4-layer stack-up will involve a ~13 mil copper layer separation with a
large 60 mil internal core. At six layers, layer separation is typically 9.5-mil
and 28-mil. For this reason a six layer design was utilized and allows a ground
plane next to each signal layer for better noise performance.

Power and digital communication signals feed into one connector and analog
signals come in on the opposing connector. This provides good isolation between
digital and analog domains. The plane split is mid-board, with power filtering
provided near the split. The digital control lines that do cross the split plane
are minimized, and series terminations are provided to minimize coupling of
digital noise. The digital and analog ground planes are bonded at a single point
with a copper net tie to provide a low impedance return path to the driving
sources. The multiplexer control signals run the length of the analog section
but are routed to keep away from critical analog signal paths. In typical
applications these multiplex control lines change synchronously with the
acquisition measurement and crosstalk effects are minimized.

Solder
~~~~~~

Sn95/Sb05 was chosen to provide a high enough melting point (>230 °C) over the
200 °C operational temperature and provide good workability and general
assembly-house availability.

Board Mounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The post mounts provided on this board are for convenience only, and are only
useful for mounting in bench testing or lab situations. They are not suitable
mounts for high shock and vibration environments. Mechanical testing was not
included in the testing of this reference design. However, it is common in
industry for high shock and vibration environments that the board can be
prepared by first staking heavy components to the board with epoxy. Susceptible
items like the IDC Headers can be encapsulated or removed from the assembly.
Typical mounting would involve a rail mount system that secures the perimeter of
the board with flexible shock mount gaskets. Alternatively the assembly can be
fully encapsulated and potted inside mounting hardware that is then affixed to
the chassis.
