AD-FMCOMMS1-EBZ Register Access
===============================

.. warning::

   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be Recommended for New Designs or in
   Production. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.

The majority of the parts are accessible via SPI. To keep inside the LPC form factor, the board uses a micro-controller as an I\ :sup:`2`\ C to SPI bridge (SPI chip selects would have pushed things over the LPC pin count).

The reference design SDK sample program provides general spi read and write
access. It is possible to expand the access for burst mode.

Transaction settings
--------------------

This must be done before a read or write:

I2C Address (Write) \| 0x03 \| spi_settings[15:8] \| spi_settings[7:0] \|
chip_select[15:8] \| chip_select[7:0] \|

Write data
----------

I2C Address (Write)\| 0x04 \| data \| data \| data (up to 62 bytes at once)

Read data
---------

I2C Address (Read) \| data \|data \| data (up to 62 bytes at once)

Read firmware version
---------------------

I2C Address (Write) \| 0x01

After sending this command the PIC firmware version can be read by issuing an
I2C read command for 32 bytes of data.

SPI settings chip select
------------------------

::

   And chip_select is 2^(chip select-1). This is a bitmap.
   This allows to address multiple parts at once.
   So the first chip select is 0x0001, the second is 0x0002, the third is 0x0004, etc.

The PIC firmware is not open source (sorry). It is released as a `Hex file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX>`_ on :git-no-OS:`Github <fmcomms1/PIC>`.

Periodically - we do update the PIC firmware for fixes/enhancements - Unless you are specifically running into one of these problems which are resolved - **DO NOT UPDATE**. There is no on-board way to update, and it does require a low cost USB programmer. It does not use a standard pinout either. It's a pain, since we do *NOT* want you to update things.

For those people who feel compelled, the instructions are below:

The microcontroller on the board is a `Microchip PIC18F24J50-I/ML <http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en534039>`_. You should select this device in your programmer. There are many programmers available for this device. We use a variety, depending on the development location.

.. important::

   Do not update the PIC without saving the calibration and FRU information (so
   you can restore it). Updating the PIC code will erase this information. It's
   a simple matter to do (This assumes you are using the Linux design - there
   isn't way to do this for the no-OS infrastructure):

   
   ::
   
   
      root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# for eeprom in $(find /sys -name eeprom); do cat $eeprom > $(echo $eeprom | sed 's:/:_:g') ; done

   Check to make sure the files are there properly (they should be 256 bytes
   each):
   
   ::
   
   
      root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# ls -l _sys
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 256 Jan  1 00:04 _sys_devices_amba.1_41600000.i2c_i2c-1_1-0050_eeprom
      -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 256 Jan  1 00:04 _sys_devices_amba.1_41600000.i2c_i2c-1_1-0054_eeprom

   and then update, when done updating, just re-write the contents:
   
   ::
   
   
      root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# for eeprom in $(ls _sys*) ; do cat $eeprom > $(echo $eeprom | sed 's:_:/:g') ; done

   To make sure things are OK, try:
   
   ::
   

   
      root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# find /sys/ -name eeprom
      /sys/devices/amba.1/41600000.i2c/i2c-1/1-0050/eeprom
      /sys/devices/amba.1/41600000.i2c/i2c-1/1-0054/eeprom

|FMComms1 programming header|\ |ADI DAC boards programming header|\ The FMComms1 board (left) uses a non-standard pinout for the PIC programming. It is on a 0.1 inch header with the configuration shown. This is almost the same as the program header found on the ADI DAC boards, shown on the right (if you have one of those cables, it's pretty easy to snip pin 4 out, and make it work). It's up to you to make sure the part is properly connected and programmed properly.
