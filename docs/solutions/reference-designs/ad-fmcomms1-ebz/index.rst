.. warning::

   The :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS1-EBZ <en/evaluation/eval-fmcomms/eb.html>` board has
   been retired and is no longer available for sale. Support has been
   discontinued, with the latest tested release being **2016_R1**. The HDL
   project has been removed from the main branch but is still available in the
   :git-hdl:`hdl_2016_r1 <hdl_2016_r1:projects/fmcomms1>` release branch.

The :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS1-EBZ <en/evaluation/eval-fmcomms/eb.html>` high-speed
analog module is designed to showcase the latest generation high-speed data
converters. It provides the analog front-end for a wide range of
compute-intensive FPGA-based radio applications.
