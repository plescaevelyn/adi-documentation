   AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ evaluation board

The :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ` is an FMC board for the :adi:`AD9364`, a highly
integrated RF Agile Transceiver. While the complete chip level design package
can be found on the
:adi:`ADI website <en/rfif-components/rfif-transceivers/products/AD9361-Integrated-RF-Agile-Transceiver-Design-Res/fca.html>`,
information on the card, and how to use it, the design package that surrounds
it, and the software which can make it work, can be found here.

The purpose of the AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ is to provide an RF platform to software
developers, system architects, etc, who want a single platform which operates
over a much wider tuning range (70 MHz -- 6 GHz).

The AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ board is very similar to the
:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ <ad-fmcomms2-ebz>` and
:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ <ad-fmcomms3-ebz>` boards with only one exception,
rather than the :adi:`AD9361` (which is 2 Rx, 2 Tx), it uses the
:adi:`AD9364`, a lower cost 1 Rx, 1 Tx device. The AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ includes
both types of external baluns, one targeted for wider tuning range applications
(Minicircuits TCM1-63AX+), and ones which provide optimized performance for
2.4 GHz.

Since much of the FMCOMMS2/3/4 share a common device and infrastructure, much
of the documentation is the same.

Functional Overview
-------------------

A functional block diagram of the system is given below. The system consists of
four functional partitions -- receive path, transmit path, clocking, and power
supply. The data path is fully integrated into the :adi:`AD9364`. The key
features of the receive and transmit paths are listed below. Please refer to the
device data sheet for more details.

AD9364
~~~~~~

Receive
^^^^^^^

- Supports 1 direct conversion RF receive channel
- Fully integrated synthesizers (including loop filter)
- Data path consists of LNA, Demodulator, LPF, ADC and digital filters
- AGC, Quadrature calibration and DC offset calibration
- Noise Figure: 2.5 dB at 1 GHz
- ADC: Continuous time sigma-delta, 640 MSPS
- Digital Filters: 128 complex taps, decimation between 2 and 48
- Gain: 1 dB step size, 80 dB analog range, 30 dB digital range
  (post ADC scaling)
- On-chip sensor for temperature-corrected RSSI

Transmit
^^^^^^^^

- Supports 1 direct conversion RF transmit channel
- Fully integrated synthesizers (including loop filter)
- Data path consists of digital filters, DAC and Modulators
- Digital Filters: 128 complex taps, interpolation between 2 and 48
- Gain: 0.25 dB step size, 86 dB range
- DAC: 320 MSPS

Clocking
^^^^^^^^

The clocks are managed by the device and are software programmable. Please refer
to the device data sheet for the various clocks within the device. The board
provides a 40 MHz crystal for the AD9364.

SPI
^^^

The SPI signals are directly passed to the FMC connector.

Control/Monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The device allows real-time control via dedicated pins. These signals are passed
to the FMC connector. The functionality of these pins are programmable and
includes gain, synchronization, state machine control, etc. Please refer to the
data sheet for more details.

The device also allows real-time monitoring of internal signals via another set
of dedicated pins. Again, these signals are passed to the FMC connector. The
internal signals are multiplexed into these pins, and details of which are best
described in the data sheet.

   AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ component locations

The AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ uses the same PCB design as the
:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ <ad-fmcomms2-ebz>` but is populated with the
:adi:`AD9364` instead of the :adi:`AD9361`.

Balun Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rev C board includes two types of baluns:

I/O Voltage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`AD9364` requires a VDD_INTERFACE voltage between 1.71 V and 2.625 V
(1.8 to 2.5 V +/- 5%).

.. warning::

   Setting the I/O voltage to 3.3 V will damage the part.
