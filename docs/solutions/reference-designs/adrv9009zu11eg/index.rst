ADRV9009-ZU11EG User Guide
===========================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG` is a highly integrated RF System-on-Module
(RF-SOM) based on the Analog Devices :adi:`ADRV9009` and the Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+ MPSoC (ZU11EG). The RF-SOM is a platform for evaluation and
prototyping. To use the RF-SOM, a carrier board is required. The Analog
Devices ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier board is designed for this purpose.

An additional RF transceiver board (:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS8-EBZ <ad-fmcomms8-ebz>`)
can be fitted to the carrier to expand the system up to 8 Tx and Rx radio
channels.

**The RF-SOM box includes:**

- ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM
- Heat spreader plate (fitted to the RF-SOM during manufacturing)

**The Carrier box includes:**

- ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier board (needed to evaluate the RF-SOM), SD card, fan
  heatsink, and other accessories to get the user up and running

Supported Devices
-----------------

- :adi:`ADRV9009`

Supported Carriers
------------------

- ADRV2CRR-FMC Carrier Board

Application Development
-----------------------

Multiple ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOMs can be synchronized together, enabling a
complete solution for complex multi-stream applications ensuring end-to-end
deterministic latency. The ADRV9009 transceivers include integrated LO and
phase synchronization. Overall system frequency and phase synchronization is
maintained with a clock tree structure using :adi:`HMC7044` devices, making
it ideal for applications requiring RF phase alignment with a large number of
channels.

The ADRV9009-ZU11EG has extensive I/O capability. Combined with the
ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier board, a variety of high-speed I/O can be evaluated,
including USB 3.0, USB 2.0, PCIe 3.0 x8, QSFP+, SFP+, 1 Gb Ethernet x2,
and CPRI capability.

An additional High Pin Count FMC daughter board
(:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS8-EBZ <ad-fmcomms8-ebz>`) can be plugged into the carrier
board with a further two ADRV9009 transceivers, increasing to a total of
eight Tx and Rx channels. A design can be evaluated and then integrated
seamlessly into a custom carrier for further prototyping or a final product,
greatly accelerating time to market.

Platform development support includes examples of Linux Industrial I/O (IIO)
applications, MATLAB, Simulink, GNU Radio, and streaming interfaces for
custom C, C++, Python, and C# applications.
