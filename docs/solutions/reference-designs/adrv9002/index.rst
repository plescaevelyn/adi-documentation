Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   The ADRV9001 is the family designator assigned to the System Development User
   Guide (UG-1828) for new ADRV9002, ADRV9003, ADRV9004, and upcoming additional
   family members. Thus, throughout this document, ADRV9001 designator may be
   used to refer to either ADRV9002, ADRV9003 or ADRV9004.

The ADRV9002 is a highly integrated RF transceiver that has dual-channel
transmitters, dual-channel receivers, integrated synthesizers, and digital
signal processing functions.

The ADRV9002 is a high performance, highly linear, high dynamic range
transceiver designed for performance vs. power consumption system
optimization. The device is configurable and ideally suited to demanding,
low power, portable and battery powered equipment. The ADRV9002 operates
from 30 MHz to 6000 MHz and covers the UHF, VHF, industrial, scientific,
and medical (ISM) bands, and cellular frequency bands in narrow-band
(kHz) and wideband operation up to 40 MHz. The ADRV9002 is capable of
both TDD and FDD operation.

The transceiver consists of direct conversion signal paths with
state-of-the-art noise figure and linearity. Each complete receiver and
transmitter subsystem includes dc offset correction, quadrature error
correction (QEC), and programmable digital filters, which eliminate the
need for these functions in the digital baseband. In addition, several
auxiliary functions, such as auxiliary analog-to-digital converters
(ADCs), auxiliary digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and
general-purpose inputs/outputs (GPIOs), are integrated to provide
additional monitoring and control capability.

Features:

- 2 × 2 highly integrated transceiver
- Frequency range of 30 MHz to 6000 MHz
- Transmitter and receiver bandwidth from 12 kHz to 40 MHz
- Two fully integrated, fractional-N, RF synthesizers
- LVDS and CMOS synchronous serial data interface options
- Low power monitor and sleep modes
- Multichip synchronization capabilities
- Fast frequency hopping
- Dynamic profile switching for dynamic data rates and sample rates
- Fully integrated DPD for narrow-band and wideband waveforms
- Fully programmable via a 4-wire SPI
- 12 mm × 12 mm, 196-ball CSP_BGA

Applications:

- Mission critical communications
- Very high frequency (VHF), ultrahigh frequency (UHF), and cellular
  to 6 GHz
- Time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD)
  applications

:adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` looks like this, with 2x ADCs and 2x DACs. The evaluation
boards are available in two variants: ADRV9002NP/W1/PCBZ (narrowband) and
ADRV9002NP/W2/PCBZ (wideband).
