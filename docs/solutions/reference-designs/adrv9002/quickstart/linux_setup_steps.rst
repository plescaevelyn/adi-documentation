Follow the steps in this order, to avoid damaging the components:

#. Connect the :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` FMC board to the FPGA carrier FMC socket.
#. On the FMC card, set the switch to select clock source between:

  - an on-board 38.4 MHz VCTCXO (default)
  - external (via J501) 10 MHz to 1000 MHz / +13 dBm

#. Connect the UART port of ZedBoard to a PC via Micro-USB (J14).
#. Insert the SD card into the slot, located on the underside of
   ZedBoard (J12).
#. Configure ZedBoard for SD BOOT: boot (JP7-JP11) and MIO0 (JP6) jumpers set
   to SD card mode, in accordance with the picture shown below.

#. Connect 12V power supply to barrel jack.
#. Turn on the power switch (SW8) on the FPGA board. Green Power LED (LD13)
   should illuminate.
#. Wait approximately 15 seconds. The blue Done LED (LD12) should illuminate.
#. Observe kernel and serial console messages on your terminal.

.. collapsible:: Optional: Local display connection (keyboard, mouse, monitor)

   You can also connect a monitor, keyboard and mouse directly to the board
   for a local connection. The UART connection is still recommended for
   debugging purposes. For the local connection, follow these additional
   steps:

   -  Plug your HDMI display device into the HDMI Video Connector (J9).
   -  Plug your USB mouse/keyboard into the USB OTG Micro-B Connector (J13).
      You will have to use a USB hub to connect both mouse and
      keyboard. Some keyboards have a mouse or touch pad sharing the same USB
      connection or wireless dongle. This can be used to eliminate the use of a
      USB hub.
   -  Wait another ~30 seconds for the HDMI display device to start showing
      signs of life.

   .. note::

      The USB OTG circuit requires specific jumper settings for Host mode.
      Ensure the following jumper settings on the ZedBoard
      (these are the defaults; verify them if USB is not working):

      * JP2 → Short (enables 5V output to USB OTG connector)
      * JP3 → Short (Host mode)
