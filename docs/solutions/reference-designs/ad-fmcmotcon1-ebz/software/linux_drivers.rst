Linux Drivers
=============

.. warning::

   Analog Devices uses six designations to inform our customers where a
   semiconductor product is in its
   :adi:`life cycle <en/support/customer-service-resources/sales/product-life-cycle-information.html>`.
   From emerging innovations to products which have been in production for
   twenty years, we understand that insight into life cycle status is important.
   Device life cycles are tracked on their individual product pages on
   `analog.com <https://www.analog.com/>`_, and should always be consulted
   before making any design decisions.

   This particular article/document/design has been retired or deprecated,
   which means it is no longer maintained or actively updated, even though the
   devices themselves may be Recommended for New Designs or in
   Production. This page is here for historical/reference purposes only.

|IIO| The Linux Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem is intended to provide support for devices that, in some sense, are analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converters. Devices that fall into this category are:

-  ADCs - can be used on ADCs ranging from a 1MSPS SoC ADC to >250 MSPS industrial ADCs
-  DACs
-  Accelerometers, gyros, IMUs
-  Capacitance-to-Digital converters (CDCs)
-  Pressure, temperature, and light sensors, etc.
-  RF Transceivers (like the AD9361)

The IIO Divers for the motor control solution require the HDL cores to have a
specified register map. A DMA interface is set up for high speed data transfer
using multiple multiplexed data channels. Below is the list of IIO drivers for
the motor control solution.

+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Each IIO driver has in the device tree and entry related to the actual driver
and an entry corresponding to the allocated DMA. Below is an example of how the
device tree looks for the motor control IIO drivers.
