   EVAL-CN0533-EBZ Evaluation Board

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0533-EBZ <CN0533>` is a MEMS accelerometer
(:adi:`ADXL1002`) vibration sensing solution with included analog 4-20 mA
current loop interface circuitry, suitable for condition-based monitoring
(CbM) applications. The 4-20 mA current loop has been an industry analog
signaling standard since the 1950s. The main advantage of this signal
standard is that there is virtually no attenuation over long cables,
therefore providing more robustness in EMI-prone environments such as
industrial and factory settings.

This reference design enables utilization of high-bandwidth, ultra-low noise
MEMS accelerometers on legacy 4-20 mA data acquisition (DAQ) systems for
CbM applications.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Sensor Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-CN0533-EBZ is straightforward to set up. A cable, power supply
(12 V to 24 V), and a 4-20 mA receiver are needed.

#. Solder a triple twisted wire or shielded cable to the EVAL-CN0533-EBZ
   printed circuit board (PCB). Connect the ground line to GND, the 4-20 mA
   output current to IOUT, and the 12 V supply to VCC as shown in the figure
   below.

#. Supply the EVAL-CN0533-EBZ with 12 V, and connect the other end of the
   IOUT and GND cables to a 4-20 mA receiver such as National Instruments
   NI-9203.

   .. note::

      Some 4-20 mA receivers have an integrated voltage supply that can be
      used instead of an external 12 V supply. Alternatively, an accurate and
      temperature-stable resistor along with a voltage DAQ system may be used
      instead of a current DAQ. The resistance value should be selected
      according to the input voltage range of the DAQ.

#. Set the acceleration sensitivity to 128 uA/g on the DAQ or vibration
   measurement equipment. The sensitivity scale of the :adi:`ADXL1002` may
   slightly vary from part to part, and can be calibrated using the gravity
   field or other reference sensors.
#. The EVAL-CN0533-EBZ is ready for experiment.

Mechanical Mounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`ADXL1002` accelerometer used in this design is an ultra-low noise
and high-bandwidth sensor. To achieve the best performance, a proper
mechanical design is required to deliver the vibration signal from the
measurement point to the sensor. Careful consideration in the design of the
EVAL-CN0533-EBZ PCB has been taken to avoid vibration signal distortion due
to mechanical resonance of the PCB structure.

The :adi:`EVAL-XLMOUNT1` mechanical interface is optimized to have a 3 dB
flat mechanical response of up to 20 kHz. By using the EVAL-XLMOUNT1, the
vibration signal is adequately coupled with the sensor.

#. Using four 4-40 3/8" screws, securely mount the EVAL-CN0533-EBZ to the
   EVAL-XLMOUNT1 mechanical interface. For optimum performance, use all four
   screws.
#. Firmly mount the EVAL-XLMOUNT1 to the vibration platform or shaker table
   using an M6 or similar diameter screw. Ensure that the sensitivity
   direction of the :adi:`ADXL1002` is aligned with the platform's main
   vibration direction.
#. Follow the steps for proper sensor connection outlined above.
