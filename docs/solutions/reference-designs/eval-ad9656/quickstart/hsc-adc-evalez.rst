   Evaluation Board Connection — :adi:`AD9656EBZ <EVAL-AD9656>` (on Left) and :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>` (on Right)

Equipment needed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Analog signal source(s) and antialiasing filter(s)
- Sample clock source (if not using the on-board crystal oscillator)
- Switching power supply (6.0V, 2.5A) for AD9656EBZ
- Switching power supply (12V, 3.3A) for HSC-ADC-EVALEZ
- PC running Windows
- USB 2.0 port
- :adi:`AD9656EBZ <EVAL-AD9656>` board
- :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>` FPGA-based data capture kit

Required software
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the following software on the PC before proceeding:

- `VisualAnalog <https://wiki.analog.com/ftp/ftp.analog.com/pub/hssp_sw/visualanalog/visualanalog_setup.exe>`_
- `SPIController <https://wiki.analog.com/ftp/ftp.analog.com/pub/adispi/a2dcomponents/install/spicontroller_setup.exe>`_

Configuring the board
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using the software for testing, configure the evaluation board as
follows:

#. Connect the :adi:`AD9656EBZ <EVAL-AD9656>` to the
   :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>` data capture board.
#. Confirm that the jumpers are installed as shown in the
   :ref:`user guide <ad9656_fmc user-guide>`.
#. The :adi:`AD9656EBZ <EVAL-AD9656>` can be powered in one of three ways. The
   default is to have the board obtain its power from the
   :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>` through the FMC connector. For this
   configuration, jumper Pin 1 to Pin 2 on both P101 and P103. The other power
   configurations are described in the
   :ref:`user guide <ad9656_fmc user-guide>`.
#. Connect the 12V, 3.3A switching power supply to the
   :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>` board.
#. Connect the :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>` board (P702) to the PC
   using a USB cable.
#. On the ADC evaluation board, use a clean signal generator with low phase
   noise to provide an input signal to the desired channel(s). Use a shielded,
   RG-58, 50Ω coaxial cable (optimally 1 m or shorter) to connect the signal
   generator. For best results, use a narrow-band, band-pass filter with 50Ω
   terminations and an appropriate center frequency.

Setting up the ADC data capture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After configuring the board hardware, set up the ADC data capture using the
following steps:

#. Start VisualAnalog on the connected PC. The appropriate part type should be
   listed in the status bar of the **VisualAnalog — New Canvas** window. Select
   the template that corresponds to the type of testing to be performed (see
   Figure 2). Average FFT is a good test to start with.

      :align: center
      :width: 500

      VisualAnalog, New Canvas Window

#. After the template is selected, a message might appear asking if the default
   configuration can be used to program the FPGA (see Figure 3). If this message
   appears, click **Yes**, and the window will close.

      VisualAnalog ADC Data Capture Block

#. In the ADC Data Capture Settings Window, General Tab, select AD9656 to be the
   device, enter the sample clock frequency (125 is the default value), as shown
   in Figure 7. The sample frequency entered here is used for scaling of
   frequency values in test results and graphs. In the Output Data field, the
   channels to be tested are selected, as well as the FFT capture depth
   ("Length"). Note that the total of the capture depths for all selected
   channels cannot exceed 256k.

      VisualAnalog ADC Data Capture Settings Window, General Tab

#. In the ADC Data Capture Settings Window, Capture Board Tab, enter 60 in the
   Fill Delay field. Push the Browse button to navigate to the FPGA program file
   for the AD9656. The default installation location and filename will be
   similar to: ``C:\Program Files\Analog
   Devices\VisualAnalog\Hardware\HADv6\AD9656_hadv6fmc.mcs``. Push the program
   button.

      :align: center
      :width: 500

      VisualAnalog ADC Data Capture Settings Window, Capture Board Tab

#. In the ADC Data Capture Settings Window, Device Tab, check the Enable Data
   Capture Controls checkbox. The capture control fields will be enabled.
   Select:

   - GTX RX Equalization: 6
   - Encode: 125MSPS (default configuration)
   - Number of lanes: 2 Lanes (At least 2 lanes are required for 125MSPS. The
     single lane bitrate at 125MSPS would exceed the driver and FPGA
     capabilities.)
   - Leave the other checkboxes unchecked.

   Though the AD9656 supports a wide variety of converter/lane/sample rate
   configurations, the software supports only the configurations in the software
   menu as an out-of-the-box functional kit. If other sample rates or
   configurations are required, an additional external clock is likely needed.

      VisualAnalog ADC Data Capture Settings Window, Device Tab

#. VisualAnalog is now set up to work with the AD9656EBZ in the default
   configuration. Other VisualAnalog features and capture settings are
   documented in the :adi:`AN-905 Application Note <AN-905>`, *VisualAnalog
   Converter Evaluation Tool Version 1.0 User Manual*.

Setting up the SPI Controller software
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the ADC data capture board setup is complete, set up the SPI controller
software using the following procedure:

#. Open the SPI controller software by going to the **Start** menu or by
   double-clicking the **SPIController** software desktop icon. If prompted for
   a configuration file, select the .cfg file whose name begins with AD9656. If
   not prompted, check the title bar of the window to determine which
   configuration is loaded. If necessary, choose **Cfg Open** from the **File**
   menu and select the appropriate file based on your part type. Note that the
   **CHIP ID(1)** box should be filled to indicate whether the correct SPI
   controller configuration file is loaded (see Figure 10).

#. In the **ADCBase0** tab of the **SPIController** window, find the **CLOCK
   DIVIDE(B)** box (see Figure 12), and the **MODES(8)** box (see Figure 13). If
   using the clock divider, use the drop-down box to select the correct clock
   divide ratio, if necessary. If there is any interruption of the ADC clock
   during power-up or during operation, a Digital Reset may be needed to
   re-initialize the ADC (Figure 13). For additional information, refer to the
   data sheet, the :adi:`AN-878 Application Note <an-878>`, *High Speed ADC SPI
   Control Software*, and the :adi:`AN-877 Application Note <an-877>`,
   *Interfacing to High Speed ADCs via SPI*.

#. In the **ADCBase1** tab of the **SPIController** window, set the number of
   lanes the AD9656 will be configured to. Note that the number of lanes
   selected here must match the settings made in VisualAnalog as shown in Step
   7, Figure 9 above.

#. Note that other settings can be changed on the **ADCBase0** tab (see Figure
   12) and the **ADC A** through **ADC D** tabs (see Figure 15) to set up the
   part in the desired mode. The **ADCBase0** tab settings affect the entire
   part, whereas the settings on the **ADC A** through **ADC D** tabs each
   affect the selected channel only. See the data sheet, the :adi:`AN-878
   Application Note <an-878>`, *High Speed ADC SPI Control Software*, and the
   :adi:`AN-877 Application Note <an-877>`, *Interfacing to High Speed ADCs via
   SPI*, for additional information on the available settings.

Adjusting the amplitude of the input signal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjust the amplitude of the input signal for each channel as follows:

#. Adjust the amplitude of the input signal so that the fundamental is at the
   desired level. Examine the **Fund Power** reading in the left panel of the
   **VisualAnalog Graph - AD9656 FFT** window (see Figure 17).

#. Repeat this procedure for the other channels, if desired.

#. Click the floppy-disk icon within the **VisualAnalog Graph - AD9656 FFT**
   window to save the performance data as a .csv formatted file for plotting or
   analysis.

Troubleshooting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lack of SPI communication will cause difficulty in configuring the ADC.

- Go to the **Global** tab of the **SPIController** window and push the **Read**
  button in the **GENERIC READ/WRITE** window. This will read the contents of
  ADC register 0x00. If SPI communication is working properly and the ADC is
  powered up, the value 0x18 hexadecimal will appear. If the contents show 0x00,
  the ADC is not powered up or SPI communication is not working.
- Check that there is correct power to the :adi:`AD9656EBZ <EVAL-AD9656>` board,
  and to the :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>`.
- Check that the USB cable is properly connected from the PC to the
  :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>`.
- The LED on the **VisualAnalog ADCDataCapture** block should be green. If it is
  red, push the USB button on the same block to refresh the connection.

If the FFT plot appears abnormal, do the following:

- If you see an abnormal noise floor, go to the **ADCBase0** tab of the
  **SPIController** window and toggle the **Chip Power Mode** in **MODES(8)**
  from **Chip Run** to **Reset** and back (Figure 13).
- If you see a normal noise floor when you disconnect the signal generator from
  the analog input, be sure that you are not overdriving the ADC. Reduce the
  input level, if necessary.
- In **VisualAnalog**, click the **Settings** icon in the **Input Formatter**
  block. Check that **Number Format** is set to the correct encoding (twos
  complement by default). Check that the **Number Format** in the **VisualAnalog
  Input Formatter** matches the data format selected in the **SPIController
  ADCBase0 OUTPUT MODE(14)** window. Repeat for the other channels.

If the FFT appears normal but the performance is poor, check the following:

- Make sure that an appropriate filter is used on the analog input.
- Make sure that the signal generators for the clock and the analog input are
  clean (low phase noise).
- Change the analog input frequency slightly if noncoherent sampling is being
  used.
- Make sure that the SPI configuration file matches the product being evaluated.

If the FFT window remains blank after **Run** in VisualAnalog (see Figure 16) is
clicked, do the following:

- Make sure that the evaluation board is securely connected to the
  :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ <hsadcevalboard>` board.
- Make sure that the correct FPGA program was installed by clicking the
  **Settings** icon in the **ADC Data Capture** block in VisualAnalog. Then
  select the **FPGA** tab and verify that the proper FPGA .mcs file (one
  containing "AD9656" in the filename) is selected for the part.
- Make sure that the FPGA has been programmed by verifying that the
  **CONFIG_DONE** LED is illuminated on the :adi:`HSC-ADC-EVALEZ
  <hsadcevalboard>` board. If the **CONFIG_DONE** LED is not illuminated, click
  the **Settings** icon in the **ADC Data Capture** block in VisualAnalog. Then
  select the **FPGA** tab and verify that the proper FPGA .mcs file (one
  containing "AD9656" in the filename) is selected for the part. Then push the
  **Program** button. The LED should light up.
- On the :adi:`AD9656EBZ <EVAL-AD9656>` there is an LED next to a reset button
  (S501). If this LED is not lit, push the reset button and try running again.
