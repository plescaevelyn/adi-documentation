Evaluation Software
===================

IIO Oscilloscope
----------------

After boot the
:doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </software/iio-oscilloscope/index>`
starts, allowing configuration of the system, data capture, and visualization.

   IIO Oscilloscope data capture window

The main window allows setting the length of data captures and selecting the
ADC channels to display. The capture length must always be set to a multiple of
256 to match the internal data bus length. There are 5 channels under the
``axi-ad9094-hpc`` device: 4 data channels (``voltage0`` to ``voltage3``) and
a 5th channel (``voltage4``) showing the MUX selections of the 4 TIAs on the
AFE board.

Sequencer Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TIA channel sequencer implemented in the LIDAR HDL design controls the MUX
selection independently for all TIAs. The sequencer can run in **auto** mode,
changing the MUX selection at every data capture based on the sequence specified
in the Auto Config section. In **manual** mode, the 4 Manual Channel controls
correspond to the 4 TIAs (U2 through U5) with values in the range 0-3. The
Pulse Delay setting controls the delay between the TIA channel change and the
next laser pulse, accounting for TIA settling time.

Laser Pulse Generator Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HDL design contains a pulse generator that precisely controls the timing of
the laser pulses. The generator must be enabled before starting data capture
because captures are triggered by laser pulses. Two parameters can be
controlled: pulse frequency and width, which together define the total optical
power of the system.

.. warning::

   The system was certified for Eye Safety Class 1 with 20 ns pulse width and
   50 kHz laser settings. Operating above these settings voids the Class 1
   certification. Laser safety glasses (e.g.,
   `LG2 <https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LG2>`__) should be
   worn at all times regardless of the laser setting.

AFE Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The APD on the AFE board needs a negative bias voltage in the range -120 V to
-200 V, controlled through the APD Bias setting. The TIA output signal offset
can be compensated via the Tilt control, which helps bring the signal close to 0
and maximize the ADC range.

JESD Link Monitoring
--------------------

At system startup the
:dokuwiki:`JESD 204B Eye Scan <resources/tools-software/linux-software/jesd_eye_scan>`
application starts to allow monitoring the status of the JESD204B link to the
AD9094 on the DAQ board.

Distance Measurements
---------------------

`lidar.py <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio/blob/main/examples/lidar.py>`__
is a standalone GUI application developed on top of Analog Devices'
`pyadi-iio <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio>`__ library.

   lidar.py GUI for distance measurement

Besides displaying the received signals, lidar.py can configure all the
relevant board parameters, including the Pulse Width, APD Bias, Tilt Voltage,
Sequencer Settings, and the parameters used to generate the reference signal.
This reference signal is then used to approximate and display the distance to
the first object the LiDAR laser is pointed at.

For the distance measurement, a correlation method is used. A single square
pulse signal with the configured pulse width is filtered with a FIR filter to
obtain a reference signal approximation. The Filter Length and Filter Cutoff
Frequency can be adjusted in real time to improve measurement accuracy. Each
displayed distance is a mean of the last 10 measurements to smooth out
variations.

Laser Safety
------------

This device complies with International Standards IEC 60825-1:2014 and 2007 for
a Class 1 laser product. This device also complies with 21 CFR 1040.10 and
1040.11 except for deviations pursuant to Laser Notice No. 50, dated
June 24, 2007. Only use software and firmware updates that are specifically
provided for this solution.

Software Support
----------------

The LiDAR Prototyping Platform software framework is common across all
hardware variants, developed with industry standard tools and interfaces.
Support is provided to cover a broad base of operating systems used across
different industry areas. There is a proven ADI JESD framework available to
reduce development complexity and time, and guarantees deterministic transfer
of data from the APD to the host processing system.
