AD-FMCLIDAR1-EBZ
=================

.. warning::

   Support for the AD-FMCLIDAR1-EBZ is discontinued on all supported carriers
   (Arria 10 SoC, ZC706, ZCU102) and it will not be supported in future
   releases. The last release with pre-built files is **2021_r1**. Check the
   :doc:`Kuiper Linux </linux/kuiper/index>` page for all releases.
   The HDL project source code can still be found on the
   :git-hdl:`hdl_2021_r1 <hdl_2021_r1:projects/ad_fmclidar1_ebz>` release
   branch.

The :adi:`AD-FMCLIDAR1-EBZ
<en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/AD-FMCLIDAR1-EBZ.html>`
is a prototyping platform for LiDAR applications that can be used on FPGA
development boards enabled with FMC HPC connector and JESD204B support
capability. It offers developers a working-out-of-box platform that can be
used for developing software and algorithms for a broad range of applications.
