CFTL-LED-BAR
=============

RGB LED Light Bar.

Description
-----------

The :adi:`CFTL-LED-BAR <CftL-LED-Bar>` is a board that contains LEDs with 3
different spectral outputs (627 nm, 530 nm and 470 nm). Each of the three
channels contains a string of four LEDs in series able to handle currents of
up to 1 A.

**Recommended LEDs:**

- Lumileds Red LED -- **LXM5-PD01**
- Lumileds Green LED -- **LXML-PM01-0080**
- Lumileds Blue LED -- **LXML-PB02**

Connectors
----------

Screw Terminals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Screw terminals P1, P5 and P9 are connectors for the anode and cathode for each
of the red, green and blue channels of the CFTL-LED-BAR. Pin 1 is the anode
and is to be connected to the positive terminal of the source while pin 2 is
the cathode and is to be connected to the negative terminal of the source.

3-Pin Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 3-pin header is used to add LEDs to the series string of each channel.
Placing a shunt on +XLEDN, where X is for the channel to be controlled and N
refers to the LED number, adds the next LED on the string and placing the
shunt on GND position terminates the string, connecting the last LED to the
negative terminal.

LED Ratings
-----------

Red Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~

Each LED on this string has a typical forward voltage of 2.9 V and is tested
with 500 mA of current. Adding LEDs to the string of LEDs in series will
result in a higher forward voltage. Please see the table below for reference:
