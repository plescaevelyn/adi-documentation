SDHC card Interfacing with EV-COG-AD3029LZ
==========================================

Introduction
------------

This document explains about the hardware and software setup, which is required
to interface the SDHC memory card to the EV-COG-AD3029LZ through SPI Interface.

The hardware details covers the pin mapping between the SDHC memory card and
EV-COG-AD3029LZ along with useful links that provides more details for
EV-COG-AD3029LZ and SDHC memory card . The software details covers the software
development kit required to interface the SDHC memory card with EV-COG-AD3029LZ
and the software architecture.

Steps
~~~~~

1. Connect the EV-GEAR-EXPANDER1Z via it’s Cog connectors to the
   EV-COG-AD3029LZ’s expansion connectors.

2. Insert the SDHC card into the SDHC slot (P2) of the expander gear as shown in
   the figure below.

Software Details
----------------

A modular implementation of FatFs library called Elm-Chan FatFs library is
provided for using SD card with Fat file system

The example software provided consists of these packs

-  Example application code.
-  Elm-Chan’s FatFs C library- This pack is required for the implementation of
   FAT file system on SD card.

- The index of API’s provided by Elm-Chan’s FatFs C library and their description can be found in this `Link <http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html>`_

- The driver version used is -> ADuCM302x-Rel1.0.6

Software Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The software architecture for the SDHC application along with the FATFS is
depicted below.

.. image:: ../images/software_flow_v1.png

The Application level software handles file management tasks such as create,
read /write ,edit files.

The Files in the FSFAT folder provides the Elm-Chan FATFS API calls. The files
under HAL folder provides the SPI interface port for the ADuCM3029 Controller.

Raw I/O without FatFs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If raw read/write access to SD card at sector level is needed in the user
application without the FATFS then the user can only use the files in HAL
folder.

To do the above, remove the static keyword from the declaration and definition
of the functions that the user needs to use from the SD.C and SD.h files. After
doing the changes user can add SD.h in their application code.

.. important::

   While using with FatFs library the user application should not call the low
   level functions (in HAL).Doing so may crash the library and lead to errors.
