EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ
==================

6-Channel, 14-Bit Current Output DAC PMOD.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ` is a minimalist SPI PMOD board for the
:adi:`AD5770R`. This module is designed as a low-cost alternative to the
fully-featured AD5770R evaluation board and has no extra signal conditioning
for the DAC.

About the AD5770R
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`AD5770R` is a 6-channel, 14-bit, multi-range, current output DAC
designed for use in communications systems, instrumentation, and industrial
applications; specifically for photonics control and current mode biasing. It
has 6 programmable output channels with 1 channel capable of sinking up to
60 mA of current.

Basic Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains the configuration and descriptions for each of the
EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ connectors, as well as how to make the necessary connections
for proper operation. Connectors P5 and P6 are included with the board but left
unsoldered. This gives the user the option of either using the provided
connectors or directly soldering wires onto the board for their design.

Connector P1 -- Digital Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

P1 connects the digital pins of the AD5770R to a system board, e.g.
EVAL-ADICUP3029. Test vias are provided for each of these pins which can be
used for debugging purposes. For a full description of each digital pin, refer
to the AD5770R datasheet.

Connector P5 -- Power Supply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pins of connector P5 are mapped to the supply pins of the AD5770R. By
default, the EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ uses the supply voltage from the controller
board for AVDD/DVDD and IOVDD.

An external power supply can be used for AVDD/DVDD instead of the system power
if jumper P2 is open.

   Jumper P2

   Jumper P2 Configuration

.. important::

   Below are the voltage ranges for the positive supplies:

   - AVDD: 2.9 V to 5.5 V
   - PVDDx: 0.8 V to AVDD - 0.4 V

Unlike the AD5770R evaluation board, the EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ has no onboard
power solution for the PVDDx pins so these must be connected to external supply
voltages. All PVDDx pins can be connected to the same supply; however, the
supplied voltage should be enough so that the load voltages on each IDACx pin
falls within the output compliance voltage of the corresponding channel (as
specified in the AD5770R datasheet).

.. tip::

   **An example for single PVDDx supply:**

   If PVDD0 to PVDD5 are all connected to +2.000 V, the maximum load voltage
   for each channel would be:

   - Channel 0: +1.550 V
   - Channel 1: +1.725 V (140 mA; low headroom mode)
   - Channel 1: +1.550 V (250 mA, 140 mA; low noise mode)
   - Channels 2 to 5: +1.725 V

Pin 3 of connector P5 is mapped to the VREF pin of the AD5770R. Connect a
reference voltage to this pin if the DAC is configured to use an external
reference. Alternatively, the internal +1.25 V reference can be made available
on this pin for use as a system reference.

Connector P6 -- Current Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pins 5 to 6 of connector P6 are mapped to the current output pins of the
AD5770R. The available output current ranges for each channel are as follows:

- **IDAC0**: 0 to 300 mA, -60 to 0 mA, -60 to 300 mA
- **IDAC1**: 0 to 140 mA, 0 to 250 mA
- **IDAC2**: 0 to 55 mA, 0 to 150 mA
- **IDAC3 to IDAC5**: 0 to 45 mA, 0 to 100 mA

.. tip::

   **Output Current Scaling:**

   *To increase the output current range,* tie multiple IDAC channels together
   to add their output currents. However, the load voltage must still fall
   within the output compliance range of both pins.

   *To decrease the output current range,* use the OUTPUT_RANGE_CHx register
   as detailed in the AD5770R datasheet. The full scale current can only be
   scaled down to 50% of its nominal value.

   * - Open
     - AVDD/DVDD supplied from external supply via P5

**Jumpers P3 and P4 -- Negative Supply:**

If IDAC0 is configured to sink current, jumpers P3 and P4 should be open and
external voltage supplies must be applied to the AVEE and PVEE pins on P6.

   Below are the voltage ranges for the negative supplies:

   - AVEE: -3.0 V to 0 V
   - PVEE0: AVEE to 0 V

MUXOUT Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal output monitor multiplexer of the AD5770R is available on pin 13
of P6. Depending on the values programmed into the MONITOR_SETUP register of
the AD5770R, this pin can be used to monitor either the output compliance
voltage or the output current of a selected IDAC channel, or the internal die
temperature of the device. Refer to the AD5770R datasheet for how to translate
the MUXOUT voltage into the aforementioned parameters.

ADICUP3029 Demo Application
----------------------------

The **ADuCM3029_demo_ad5770rpmdz** project provides a solution to control the
EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ PMOD using a minimal CLI and the no-OS drivers for the
EVAL-ADICUP3029 platform.

The application builds upon the no-OS device and platform drivers and a minimal
CLI module to provide a robust command set to set the range and output value of
the channels.

The program first initializes the hardware system as well as the driver
handlers, then goes into the main process that implements the CLI process and
waits for user commands. If a command is received, it is executed and the
program returns to the main loop.

Demo Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware:

- :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029`
- :adi:`EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ`
- Micro-USB to USB cable
- PC or laptop with USB port

Software:

- `ADuCM3029_demo_ad5770rpmdz Source Code <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/EVAL-ADICUP3029/tree/master/projects/ADuCM3029_demo_ad5770rpmdz>`__
- CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.9.1 or higher)
- ADuCM302x DFP (3.2.0 or higher)
- ADICUP3029 BSP (1.1.0 or higher)
- Serial terminal program (PuTTY or Tera Term)

Setting up the Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect EVAL-AD5770R-PMDZ board to the EVAL-ADICUP3029 using connector
   **P8**.
2. Connect a micro-USB cable to P10 connector of the EVAL-ADICUP3029 and
   connect it to a computer.

Obtaining the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the
AD5770R PMOD:

1. **Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the DAPLINK drive** -- This is the
   easiest way to get started.
2. **Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES** -- Allows customization
   but requires downloading the CrossCore toolchain.

The software for the ADuCM3029_demo_ad5770 demo can be found here:

- `Prebuilt AD5770R PMOD Hex File <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/EVAL-ADICUP3029/releases/download/Latest/ADuCM3029_demo_ad5770rpmdz.hex>`__
- `ADuCM3029_demo_ad5770rpmdz Source Code <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/EVAL-ADICUP3029/tree/master/projects/ADuCM3029_demo_ad5770rpmdz>`__

Serial Terminal Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A serial terminal is an application that runs on a PC or laptop that is used to
display data and interact with a connected device. The device's UART peripheral
is connected to a UART to USB interface IC, which appears as a traditional COM
port on the host PC/laptop.

Recommended serial terminal programs:

- `Tera Term <https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en>`__
- `PuTTY <https://www.putty.org/>`__
- `RealTerm <https://realterm.sourceforge.io/>`__

The following parameters must be configured in the serial terminal program:

.. code-block:: none

   Select COM Port
   Baud rate: 115200
   Data: 8 bit
   Parity: none
   Stop: 1 bit
   Flow Control: none

.. tip::

   If you see nothing in the serial terminal, try hitting the reset button on
   the embedded development board.

Available Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typing ``help`` or ``h`` after the initial calibration sequence will display
the list of commands and their short versions. Below is the command list:
