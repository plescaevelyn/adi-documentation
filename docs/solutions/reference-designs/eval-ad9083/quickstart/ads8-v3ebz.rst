Introduction to the AD9083 Plugin
-----------------------------------

The AD9083 plugin allows the user to evaluate the AD9083 chip via the AD9083EBZ
evaluation board. The AD9083EBZ provides the power and clocking necessary to
evaluate the AD9083 16-Channel ADC. The Power Delivery Network is powered by a
LTM8074 1.2A Silent Switcher µModule Regulator and clocking is provided by an
AD9528 JESD204B Clock Generator. The reference for the AD9528 is an on-board 100
MHz VCXO.

The AD9083EBZ Plugin will configure the AD9083 using the API. The Plugin
generates the API commands, which are then downloaded to the MicroZed™, which in
turn configures the AD9083.

The Plugin will also configure the AD9528 using the clocking requirements from
the Startup Wizard.

To start using the AD9083EBZ, first ensure the board is connected as shown in
Figure 1. Next, ensure that the ADS8-V3EBZ board is powered on before opening
ACE. When the user opens the ACE software, the plugin appears in the Attached
Hardware section of the ACE GUI (see Figure 4).

External Trigger
----------------

SMA connector J2 on the ADS8-V3EBZ can be used as an optional trigger so that the
data capture start time can be controlled. The trigger requires a 1.8V active
high pulse width that is longer than the FPGA internal peripheral clock, which
has a frequency of 50 MHz. To enable the external trigger:

1. Click on "Navigate to FPGA SPI" on the block diagram of the AD9083 Chip View.

.. image:: ../images/navigate_to_fpga_spi.png
   :width: 600

2. Click on the "+" sign next to Address (Hex) 0106.

.. image:: ../images/0106.png
   :width: 600

3. Click on the "0" that is on the same row as "ext_trig_en". The 0 will change
   to a 1.

.. image:: ../images/ext_trig_en.png
   :width: 600

4. Click "Apply Changes".

.. image:: ../images/apply_changes.png
   :width: 100

SMA connector J3 is normally used as a system ready indicator. It indicates that
the FPGA is ready to accept an external trigger.

To capture data, click on "Run Once" as normal. Capture will begin once 1.8V is
detected on connector J2 of the ADS8-V3EBZ.

Troubleshooting Notes
---------------------

Evaluation Board is not Functioning Properly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible that a board component has been rendered inoperable by ESD,
removing a jumper during powered operation, accidental shorting while probing,
etc. Try checking the supply domain voltages of the power adapter board while it
is powered. They should be as follows:

====== ========== ===============
Domain Test Point Approx. Voltage
====== ========== ===============
12V_IN TP19       12V
V1P0V  TP6        1V
V1P8V  TP14       1.8V
====== ========== ===============

Evaluation Board is not Communicating with the ADS8-V3 / No SPI Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Make sure the USB cable is making good connection on the ADS8-V3EBZ board and
  the PC. Try another USB port on the PC if needed. Some PCs work best with a
  SuperSpeed USB 3.0 port.

  - The ADS8-V3EBZ should show up on the PC Device Manager.

- Make sure that the FPGA on the ADS8-V3 has been programmed — a lit FPGA_DONE
  LED DS15 on the top of the ADS8-V3 and a powered fan are good indicators of
  the FPGA being programmed.
- Check the common mode voltage on the JESD204B traces. On the evaluation board,
  the common mode voltage should be roughly 0.5V. On the ADS8-V3, the common
  mode voltage should be around 0.8V.
- To test SPI operation, attempt to both read and write to register 0x000A
  (Scratch Pad Register) using ACE's Register Debugger. If the register reads
  back the same value written to it, SPI is operational.

  - All registers reading back as either all ones or all zeros (i.e., 0xFF or
    0x00) may indicate no SPI communication.
  - Register 0x0000 (SPI Configuration A) reading back 0x81 in ACE may indicate
    no SPI communication as a result of the FPGA on the ADS8-V3 not being
    programmed.

Evaluation Board Fails to Capture Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure that the board is functioning properly and that SPI communication is
  successful — see previous troubleshooting tips.
- Check the signal generator input on connector J20. Using SPI, read the On-Chip
  PLL lock Detect register 0xD44 to see if the on-chip PLL is locked. Try
  placing a differential oscilloscope probe on the clock pins to see if the
  clock signal is reaching the chip.
- Check the JESD204B PLL Locked indicator or register 0x301F (PLL Status). If
  the light in the plugin chip view is green / if the register reads back 0x80,
  the PLL is locked. If it is not locked:

  - Restart the evaluation board setup (power cycle FPGA, start a new session in
    ACE) by following the instructions from the start.
  - Make sure P3 (Power Down / Standby Jumper) is not jumped.
