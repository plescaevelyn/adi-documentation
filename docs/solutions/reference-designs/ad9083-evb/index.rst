AD9083-EVB User Guide
=====================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD9083` is a 16-bit, 16-channel with 125 MHz bandwidth per channel
(2 GSPS total) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring an on-chip
programmable, single-pole antialiasing filter and termination resistor that is
designed for low power, small size, and ease of use.

The dual ADC cores feature a multistage, differential pipelined architecture
with integrated output error correction logic. Each ADC features wide
bandwidth inputs supporting a variety of user-selectable input ranges.

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

The AD9083_EVB reference design is a processor-based embedded system. The
design consists of a receive chain that transports captured samples from the
ADC to the system memory (DDR). Before transferring the data to DDR, the
samples are stored in a buffer implemented on block RAMs from the FPGA fabric.

The link operates with the following parameters:

- Deframer: L=4, M=16, F=8, S=1, N'=16
- JESD204B Lane Rate: 10 Gbps
- ADC Clock: 2000 MHz
- JESD204B Subclass 0

Software Support

Linux Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`AD9083` is a 16-channel, 125 MHz bandwidth, continuous time
sigma-delta (CTSD) ADC. The 16 ADC cores feature a first-order CTSD modulator
architecture with integrated background nonlinearity correction logic and
self-cancelling dither. Each ADC has a signal processing tile containing a
cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filter, a quadrature digital downconverter
(DDC) with multiple FIR decimation filters, or up to three quadrature DDC
channels with averaging decimation filters for data gating applications.

Users can configure the Subclass 1 JESD204B based high-speed serialized
output in a variety of lane configurations (up to four), depending on the DDC
configuration and the acceptable lane rate of the receiving logic device.

The AD9083 Linux IIO driver depends on **SPI**.

AD9083 Plugin Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD9083 plugin allows the user to evaluate the :adi:`AD9083` via the
AD9083EBZ evaluation board. The AD9083EBZ provides the power and clocking
necessary to evaluate the 16-channel ADC. The power delivery network is
powered by a :adi:`LTM8074` 1.2A Silent Switcher uModule Regulator, and
clocking is provided by an :adi:`AD9528` JESD204B clock generator with an
on-board 100 MHz VCXO reference.

The plugin configures the AD9083 using the API. Commands are generated by the
plugin, downloaded to the MicroZed, which in turn configures the AD9083. The
plugin also configures the AD9528 using the clocking requirements from the
Startup Wizard.

To begin, ensure the board is connected as shown in the setup figure and that
the ADS8-V3EBZ board is powered on before opening ACE. The plugin appears in
the **Attached Hardware** section of the ACE GUI.

**Board View**

Double-clicking the board icon in the Attached Hardware section opens the
AD9083EBZ board view. The board view enables quick setup of the AD9083 using
the **STARTUP WIZARD** pane. It may take several moments for the board view to
initialize.

chip view enables customization of the AD9083 beyond the functions available
in the board view.

External Trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SMA connector J2 on the ADS8-V3EBZ can be used as an optional trigger to
control the data capture start time. The trigger requires a 1.8 V active-high
pulse width longer than one period of the FPGA internal peripheral clock
(50 MHz).

To enable the external trigger:

1. Click **Navigate to FPGA SPI** on the block diagram of the AD9083 chip
   view.

   .. image:: navigate_to_fpga_spi.png
      :align: center

2. Click the **+** sign next to Address (Hex) ``0x0106``.

   .. image:: 0106.png
      :align: center

3. Click the **0** on the same row as ``ext_trig_en``. The value changes
   to **1**.

   .. image:: ext_trig_en.png
      :align: center

4. Click **Apply Changes**.

   .. image:: apply_changes.png
      :align: center

SMA connector J3 is normally used as a system ready indicator, signaling that
the FPGA is ready to accept an external trigger. To capture data, click
**Run Once** as normal. Capture begins when a 1.8 V pulse is detected on
connector J2 of the ADS8-V3EBZ.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Board Not Functioning Properly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A board component may have been rendered inoperable by ESD, removing a jumper
during powered operation, accidental shorting while probing, or similar causes.
Check the supply domain voltages on the power adapter board while powered:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Domain
     - Test Point
     - Approx. Voltage
   * - 12V_IN
     - TP19
     - 12 V
   * - V1P0V
     - TP6
     - 1.0 V
   * - V1P8V
     - TP14
     - 1.8 V

No SPI Communication with ADS8-V3EBZ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Ensure the USB cable has a good connection on both the ADS8-V3EBZ board and
  the PC. Try another USB port if needed; some PCs work best with a USB 3.0
  port.
- The ADS8-V3EBZ should appear in the PC Device Manager.
- Verify that the FPGA on the ADS8-V3EBZ has been programmed. A lit
  ``FPGA_DONE`` LED (DS15) on the top of the ADS8-V3EBZ and a powered fan are
  good indicators.
- Check the common-mode voltage on the JESD204B traces. On the evaluation
  board, the common-mode voltage should be approximately 0.5 V. On the
  ADS8-V3EBZ, it should be around 0.8 V.
- To test SPI operation, read and write to register ``0x000A`` (Scratch Pad
  Register) using the ACE Register Debugger. If the register reads back the
  same value written to it, SPI is operational.

  - All registers reading back as ``0xFF`` or ``0x00`` may indicate no SPI
    communication.
  - Register ``0x0000`` (SPI Configuration A) reading back ``0x81`` may
    indicate the FPGA on the ADS8-V3EBZ has not been programmed.

Board Fails to Capture Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Ensure the board is functioning properly and SPI communication is
  successful (see previous troubleshooting tips).
- Check the signal generator input on connector J20. Using SPI, read the
  on-chip PLL Lock Detect register ``0xD44`` to verify the PLL is locked.
  Place a differential oscilloscope probe on the clock pins to confirm the
  clock signal reaches the chip.
- Check the JESD204B PLL Locked indicator or register ``0x301F`` (PLL
  Status). If the indicator in the plugin chip view is green, or if the
  register reads back ``0x80``, the PLL is locked. If it is not locked:

  - Restart the evaluation board setup (power-cycle the FPGA, start a new
    session in ACE) by following the instructions from the beginning.
  - Ensure that P3 (Power Down / Standby jumper) is not jumped.
