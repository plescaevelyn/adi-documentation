EVAL-CN0202-SDPZ
=================

Flexible Programmable Analog Output with Precision Reference.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0202` is a full-function, flexible, programmable analog output solution
that meets most requirements for programmable logic controller (PLC) and
distributed control system (DCS) applications. It provides all the typical
voltage and current output ranges with 16-bit resolution and no missing codes,
0.05% linearity, and less than 0.2% total output error. The circuit also
contains key features for industrial applications, such as on-chip output
fault detection and protection (short circuit, under voltage output, open
circuit current output, and over temperature), CRC checking to prevent packet
error (PEC), and flexible power-up options, making it an ideal choice for
robust industrial control systems.

The :adi:`AD5750` is a single-channel, low-cost, precision voltage/current
output driver developed to meet the requirements of industrial process control
applications. The voltage output range can be programmed for the standard
output ranges for PLC and DCS applications: 0 V to 5 V, 0 V to 10 V, -5 V to
+5 V, and -10 V to +10 V with a 20% overrange setting provided for the
standard ranges. The current output, which is provided on a separate pin, can
be programmed for the ranges of 4 mA to 20 mA, 0 mA to 20 mA, -20 mA to
+20 mA, 0 mA to 24 mA, and -24 mA to +24 mA. The unipolar ranges have a 2%
overrange setting.

The :adi:`AD5662` is a single-channel, low-cost, low-power (0.75 mW at 5 V),
rail-to-rail voltage buffered output nanoDAC device. It guarantees +/-1 LSB
DNL under a wide range of reference voltages that can vary from 0.75 V to the
VDD supply so that it can operate with the :adi:`AD5750` from a common
reference source of 4.096 V, provided by the :adi:`ADR444`.

The :adi:`ADR444` low drift (3 ppm/C maximum for B-grade), high initial
accuracy (0.04% maximum for B-grade), and low noise (1.8 uV p-p typical,
0.1 Hz to 10 Hz) provides the reference voltage for both the :adi:`AD5750`
and :adi:`AD5662` and guarantees ultralow noise, high accuracy, and low
temperature drift for the circuit.

The EVAL-CN0202-SDPZ board connects to ADI's System Demonstration Platform
(SDP) and is powered by a triple output DC power supply of +15 V, -15 V and
6 V.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Block Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: cn0202_block_diagram.png

   EVAL-CN0202-SDPZ block diagram

- The EVAL-CN0202-SDPZ (CN-0202 Board) connects to the :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CB1Z`
  (SDP-B Board) via the 120-pin connector.
- The :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CB1Z` (SDP-B Board) connects to the PC via the USB
  cable.
- Terminal block **CN1** is the +/-15 V power supply input.
- Terminal block **CN2** is the +6 V power supply input.
- Terminal block **CN3** is for the voltage output measurement.

  - **Optionally**, if **JP3** and **JP4** are open, the :adi:`AD5750` output
    voltage feedback can be configured by connecting **VSENSE+** and
    **VSENSE-** across a selected branch in the load circuit. **VSENSE-**
    should be within +/-3.0 V of GND.

- Terminal block **CN4** is for the current output measurement.

.. important::

   Power on the EVAL-CN0202-SDPZ through the triple output power supply and
   the SDP-B board through the PC **separately** before connecting the two
   boards together.

Jumper Settings

Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Extract **CN0202_Evaluation_Software.zip** and open **setup.exe**.

   .. note::

      It is recommended to install the software to the default path
      ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Analog Devices\CN0202\`` and all National
      Instruments products to ``C:\Program Files\National Instruments\``.
