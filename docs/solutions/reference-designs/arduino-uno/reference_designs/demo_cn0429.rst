Electrochemical Gas Sensor Demo
===============================

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The **CN0429_example** is a demo using the **EVAL-CN0429-EBZ**, the
**EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT** and the **Arduino Uno** board as a solution for
detecting toxic gases. By utilizing built-in diagnostics features (such
as impedance spectroscopy or bias voltage pulsing and ramping) it is
possible to inspect sensor health, compensate for accuracy drift due to
aging or temperature, and estimate the remaining lifetime of the sensor
right at the edge of the sensor network without user intervention. This
functionality allows smart, accurate sensor replacement at the individual
edge nodes. An integrated, ultra low power microcontroller directly
biases the electrochemical gas sensor and runs onboard diagnostic
algorithms.

The :adi:`CN0429` circuit shows how an electrochemical gas sensor is
connected to the potentiostat circuit and how it is biased and measured.
Common 2-lead, 3-lead, and 4-lead electrochemical gas sensors can be
used interchangeably. The integration of this signal chain dramatically
reduces cost, size, complexity, and power consumption at the sensor
node.

This example uses three types of boards:

-  The **EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT** Arduino Shield Board
-  The **Arduino Uno** Board

This setup is capable to measure any electrochemical gas sensor in a suitable
package and up to 4 sensor boards can be connected and measured simultaneously.
The gas sensor daughter boards includes temperature and humidity sensor for
calibration and the system includes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and
bias voltage pulse test capabilities.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  Arduino Uno
   -  :adi:`EVAL-CN0429-EBZ Gas Sensor Daughter Board loaded with firmware. <en/design-center/reference-designs/hardware-reference-design/circuits-from-the-lab/CN0429.html>` (up to 4)
   -  :adi:`EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT Arduino-compatible platform. <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT.html>`
   -  Type B to Type A USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port
   -  Electrochemical Gas Sensor in a suitable form factor (up to 4)

-  Software

   -  CN0429_example sketch
   -  Arduino Interactive Development Environment(IDE)
   -  Arduino AVR Boards Built-In by Arduino package (1.6.23 or higher)

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

-  Plug in the **EVAL-CN0429-EBZ**
   (:adi:`CN0429 <en/design-center/reference-designs/hardware-reference-design/circuits-from-the-lab/CN0429.html>`
   Shield board) to the
   :adi:`EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT.html>`
   interposer board
-  Connect the system to the Arduino connectors DIGITAL (PWM~), POWER, ANALOG IN
   and ICSP of the Arduino Uno board.

   -  Note, the boards should only plug together one way, preventing reverse
      connections.

-  Connect the system to the PC using USB cable
-  Connect the sensors to the dedicated connectors on the
   **EVAL-CN0429-EBZ**. The
   :adi:`CN0429 <en/design-center/reference-designs/hardware-reference-design/circuits-from-the-lab/CN0429.html>`
   is compatible with electrochemical gas sensors in "4-series" form
   factor. 2-, 3- and 4-electrode sensors are supported. See the drawing
   below for form factor dimensions.

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

We recommend not opening the project directly, but rather make a local copy in
your workspace and open it using Arduino/Genuino IDE.

The source code and include files of the **CN0429_example** can be found here:

.. admonition:: Download
   :class: download


   `CN0429_example at Github <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/arduino/tree/cn0429/Arduino%20Uno%20R3/examples/CN0429_example>`_


Project Structure
-----------------

The CN0411_example is a C Arduino sketch. All files are in the same folder as
the .ino file and include the source and header files.

Compiling, Verifying, and Programming
-------------------------------------

-  Once the project has been imported and the software parameters have
   been appropriately configured, you must Compile/Verify the project
   within the Arduino IDE. You can do this by clicking on the Sketch
   menu, and then on the *Compile/Verify* option.
-  Once the project is compiled and free of errors, you can now upload
   the project to the Arduino Uno. Click on the Sketch menu item, and
   then click *Upload*.

These two steps can also be done using the quick buttons on the Arduino sketch.
Check out the image below for locations of the quick buttons.

Outputting Data
---------------

Data is output using the USB cable from the Arduino to the PC. The USB port acts
as a serial terminal to display the data being transmitted via UART. Opening the
serial terminal window from the Arduino IDE is very easy, simply click on the
button shown in the picture below.

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may need to configure the serial terminal depending on the current settings
of the Arduino IDE. Make sure the settings are as follows:

::

     Select COM Port
     Baud rate: 115200
     Data: 8 bit
     Parity: none
     Stop: 1 bit
     Flow Control: none

Tools Download and Help
-----------------------

The Arduino tools are easy to use, and there are many tutorials and users guides
to help learn how to use the Arduino IDE.
