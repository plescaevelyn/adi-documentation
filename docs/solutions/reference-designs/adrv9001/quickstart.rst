ADRV9001/ADRV9002 Quick Start Guides
=====================================

The Quick Start Guides provide step by step instructions on how to do an
initial system setup for the :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` (ADRV9002NP/W1/PCBZ and
ADRV9002NP/W2/PCBZ) boards on various FPGA development boards. They discuss
how to program the bitstream, run a no-OS program or boot a Linux distribution.

Supported Carriers
------------------

The :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` is, by definition, an "FPGA mezzanine card" (FMC),
which means it needs a carrier to plug into. The supported carriers are:

.. [1] VADJ must be reprogrammed to 1.8V on the ZC706.
.. [2] On the ZC706 and ZedBoard, the FMC connectors map to HR IO banks. The
   HR banks require VCCO set to 2.5V for LVDS I/O standard, but the ADRV9001
   evaluation board uses 1.8V IO supplies without level shifters. Therefore
   VCCO (VADJ) must be set to 1.8V, limiting operation to CMOS mode only.
   More information on the limitation can be found in the
   `7 Series SelectIO guide <https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/ug471_7Series_SelectIO>`__
   section 'LVDS and LVDS_25' and Table 1-43.
.. [3] Not supported due to sub-optimal mapping of clock pins from the source
   synchronous interfaces.

CMOS-Only Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the ZC706 and ZedBoard platforms the FMC connectors map to HR (High Range)
IO banks. The HR banks have a limitation that when using the LVDS I/O standard
the bank VCCO voltage must be set to 2.5V. However, the :adi:`ADRV9001`
evaluation board uses IO supplies of 1.8V and does not have level shifters for
the single-ended lines. Therefore the VCCO of the banks (VADJ) must be set to
1.8V, restricting operation to CMOS mode only. For more information on this
limitation, refer to the
`7 Series SelectIO guide <https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/ug471_7Series_SelectIO>`__
section 'LVDS and LVDS_25' and Table 1-43.

See the :doc:`HDL Reference Design <reference_hdl>` for details on building
the design with ``CMOS_LVDS_N=1`` for CMOS interface.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a minimum to begin evaluating the :adi:`ADRV9002`, you need:

- The :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` FMC card.
- One of the supported carrier platforms listed above.
- A way to interact with the platform: UART terminal, Ethernet connection,
  and optionally a DisplayPort or HDMI monitor with USB keyboard and mouse.
- An internet connection to download or update the :doc:`Kuiper Linux </linux/kuiper/index>`
  SD card image.
- RF test equipment for signal evaluation.

Hardware Setup
--------------

In most carriers, the :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` board connects to the HPC1
connector (unless otherwise noted). The carrier setup requires power,
UART (115200), Ethernet (Linux), DisplayPort or HDMI (if available) and/or
JTAG (no-OS) connections.

Identify Your Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evaluation boards were equipped with different silicon revisions. All boards
built since the middle of December 2020 have **C0** silicon; older ones use
**B0** silicon and are no longer shipped.

Each revision of silicon requires its corresponding software support files.
