ADRV9002 ZedBoard Quick Start Guide
=====================================

This guide provides step by step instructions on how to set up the
:adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` (ADRV9002NP/W1/PCBZ and ADRV9002NP/W2/PCBZ) on:

- `ZedBoard <https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/zedboard/start>`__
  Rev C or later

Instructions on how to build the Zynq Linux kernel and device trees from source
can be found at
:git-linux:`arch/arm/boot/dts/xilinx` and in the
`ADI Linux build guide <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/linux/build/generic/zynq.html>`__.

LVDS Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the
`7 Series SelectIO guide <https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/ug471_7Series_SelectIO>`__
section 'LVDS and LVDS_25' and Table 1-43, the LVDS I/O standard (VADJ 1.8V) is
not supported on High Range banks.

Since the evaluation board can only operate with **VADJ set to 1.8V** and the
FMC connector on the ZedBoard is mapped to HR banks, the **LVDS interface is not
supported**. Only CMOS operation is possible.

Required Software
-----------------

- 16 GB SD card imaged using :doc:`/linux/kuiper/index`. Use the 2019_R2 or
  later release.
- Copy the boot files from the ``zynq-zed-adrv9002`` directory directly on
  the SD card ``BOOT`` partition:

  - ``BOOT.bin``
  - ``uImage``
  - ``devicetree.dtb``

- A UART terminal (PuTTY/Tera Term/Minicom, etc.), baud rate 115200 (8N1).

Required Hardware
-----------------

- `ZedBoard <https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/zedboard/start>`__
  Rev C or later
- :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` FMC board
- Reference clock source
- Micro-USB cable
- Ethernet cable
- Optionally USB keyboard, mouse and an HDMI compatible monitor

.. warning::

   ESD precautions should be taken when handling evaluation boards.

Testing
-------

.. warning::

   Before executing below steps, **VADJ must be set to 1.8V**.
   This can be done by changing VADJ jumper (JP18) from default (2V5) to
   1V8.

On the ADRV9002 card, there is a red LED close to the FMC connector. This LED
indicates if VADJ voltage exceeded 2.0V. If the LED does not turn off after a
few seconds after boot, VADJ is exceeding the recommended level, decreasing
board lifetime and potentially causing permanent damage to the IC.

- Connect the :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` FMC board to the FPGA carrier FMC socket.
- On the FMC card, set the switch to select clock source between:

  - an on-board 38.4 MHz VCTCXO (default)
  - external (via J501) 10 MHz to 1000 MHz / +13 dBm

- Connect the UART port of ZedBoard (J14) to a PC via Micro-USB.
- Insert the SD card into the slot (J12), located on the underside of
  ZedBoard.
- Configure ZedBoard for SD BOOT: boot (JP7-JP11) and MIO0 (JP6) jumpers set
  to SD card mode.
- Connect 12V power supply to barrel jack (J20).
- Turn on the power switch (SW8) on the FPGA board. Green Power LED (LD13)
  should illuminate.
- Wait approximately 15 seconds. The blue Done LED (LD12) should illuminate.
- Observe kernel and serial console messages on your terminal.

.. note::

   *USB-OTG* feature: To use USB peripheral devices with ZedBoard, install
   jumpers JP2 and JP3.

   For more detailed information on ZedBoard jumper settings, check the
   *ZedBoard Hardware User Guide* available on the
   `ZedBoard doc page <https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/zedboard/start>`__.

Expected IIO Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These devices should be present after a successful boot:

.. code-block:: console

   root@analog:~# iio_info | grep iio:device
           iio:device0: adrv9002-phy
           iio:device1: xadc
           iio:device2: axi-adrv9002-rx-lpc (buffer capable)
           iio:device3: axi-adrv9002-rx2-lpc (buffer capable)
           iio:device4: axi-adrv9002-core-tdd1-lpc
           iio:device5: axi-adrv9002-core-tdd2-lpc
           iio:device6: axi-adrv9002-tx-lpc (buffer capable)
           iio:device7: axi-adrv9002-tx2-lpc (buffer capable)

For more details on device modes (independent vs MIMO), see the
:git-linux:`ADRV9002 Linux driver documentation <drivers/iio/adc/navassa>`.

pyadi-iio
~~~~~~~~~

`pyadi-iio <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio>`__ is a Python
abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO drivers. An ADRV9002 example
can be found
`here <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio/blob/main/examples/adrv9002_example.py>`__.

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </software/iio-oscilloscope/index>` application
can be used to connect to another platform that has a connected device in
order to configure the device and read data from it.

Build and start osc on a network-enabled Linux host. Once the application is
launched, go to Settings > Connect and enter the IP address of the target.

.. note::

   Even though this is Linux, this is a persistent file system. Care should
   be taken not to corrupt the file system --- please shut down properly.
   Use ``sudo shutdown -h now`` from the terminal.
