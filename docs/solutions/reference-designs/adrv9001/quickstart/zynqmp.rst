ADRV9002 ZCU102 Quick Start Guide
===================================

This guide provides step by step instructions on how to set up the
:adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` (ADRV9002NP/W1/PCBZ and ADRV9002NP/W2/PCBZ) on:

- :xilinx:`ZCU102 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-u1-zcu102-g.html>` Rev 1.0 or later

Instructions on how to build the ZynqMP / MPSoC Linux kernel and device trees
from source can be found at
:git-linux:`arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx` and in the
`ADI Linux build guide <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/linux/build/generic/zynqmp.html>`__.

Required Software
-----------------

- 16 GB SD card imaged using :doc:`/linux/kuiper/index`. Use the 2019_R2 or
  later release.
- A UART terminal (PuTTY/Tera Term/Minicom, etc.), baud rate 115200 (8N1).

Required Hardware
-----------------

- :xilinx:`ZCU102 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-u1-zcu102-g.html>` Rev 1.0 or later board
- :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` FMC board
- Reference clock source
- Micro-USB cable
- Ethernet cable
- Optionally USB keyboard, mouse and a DisplayPort compatible monitor

.. warning::

   ESD precautions should be taken when handling evaluation boards.

SD Card Boot Files
------------------

The files that need to be present on the SD card ``BOOT`` partition are:

- ``BOOT.bin``
- ``Image``
- ``system.dtb``

Copy these from the ``zynqmp-zcu102-rev10-adrv9002`` directory.

Testing
-------

- Connect the :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` FMC board to the FPGA carrier **HPC0**
  (FMC0) socket.
- On the FMC card, set the switch to select clock source between:

  - an on-board 38.4 MHz VCTCXO (default)
  - external (via J501) 10 MHz to 1000 MHz / +13 dBm

- Connect USB UART J83 (Micro-USB) to your host PC.
- Insert SD card into socket.
- Configure ZCU102 for SD BOOT (mode SW6[4:1] switch in the position
  **OFF, OFF, OFF, ON**).
- Turn on the power switch on the FPGA board.
- Observe kernel and serial console messages on your terminal (use the first
  ttyUSB or COM port registered).

Expected IIO Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For independent mode, these devices should be present after a successful boot:

.. code-block:: console

   root@analog:~# iio_info | grep iio:device
           iio:device0: ams
           iio:device1: adrv9002-phy
           iio:device2: axi-adrv9002-rx-lpc (buffer capable)
           iio:device3: axi-adrv9002-rx2-lpc (buffer capable)
           iio:device4: axi-adrv9002-core-tdd1-lpc
           iio:device5: axi-adrv9002-core-tdd2-lpc
           iio:device6: axi-adrv9002-tx-lpc (buffer capable)
           iio:device7: axi-adrv9002-tx2-lpc (buffer capable)

For MIMO mode, these devices should be present:

.. code-block:: console

   root@analog:~# iio_info | grep iio:device
           iio:device0: ams
           iio:device1: adrv9002-phy
           iio:device2: axi-adrv9002-rx-lpc (buffer capable)
           iio:device3: axi-adrv9002-core-tdd-lpc
           iio:device4: axi-adrv9002-tx-lpc (buffer capable)

For more details on device modes (independent vs MIMO), see the
:git-linux:`ADRV9002 Linux driver documentation <drivers/iio/adc/navassa>`.

pyadi-iio
~~~~~~~~~

`pyadi-iio <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio>`__ is a Python
abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO drivers. An ADRV9002 example
can be found
`here <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio/blob/main/examples/adrv9002_example.py>`__.

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`IIO Oscilloscope </software/iio-oscilloscope/index>` application
can be used to connect to another platform that has a connected device in
order to configure the device and read data from it.

Build and start osc on a network-enabled Linux host. Once the application is
launched, go to Settings > Connect and enter the IP address of the target
in the popup window.

.. note::

   Even though this is Linux, this is a persistent file system. Care should
   be taken not to corrupt the file system --- please shut down properly,
   do not just turn off the power switch. Use ``sudo shutdown -h now``
   from the terminal.
