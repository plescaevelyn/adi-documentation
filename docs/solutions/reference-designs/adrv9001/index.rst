The :adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` (ADRV9002NP/W1/PCBZ, low band 30 MHz to 3 GHz) and
:adi:`EVAL-ADRV9002` (ADRV9002NP/W2/PCBZ, high band 3 GHz to 6 GHz) are FMC
radio cards for the :adi:`ADRV9002` highly integrated RF transceiver, offering
dual channel transmitters and dual channel receivers, integrated synthesizers,
and digital signal processing functions. The IC delivers a versatile combination
of high performance and low power consumption required by battery powered radio
equipment and can operate in both FDD and TDD modes. The ADRV9002 operates from
30 MHz to 6000 MHz covering the VHF, licensed and unlicensed cellular bands, and
ISM bands. The IC is capable of supporting both narrowband and wideband standards
up to 40 MHz bandwidth on both receive and transmit.

While the complete chip level design package can be found on the
:adi:`ADI web site <en/design-center/landing-pages/001/integrated-rf-agile-transceiver-design-resources.html>`,
information on the card and how to use it, the design package that surrounds it,
and the software which can make it work can be found here.

Naming Conventions
------------------

The ADRV9001 is a family designator assigned to the System Development User
Guide (UG-1828 for ADRV9002, ADRV9003, ADRV9004, and upcoming additional
family members). Throughout this documentation, the ADRV9001 designator may be
used to refer to either :adi:`ADRV9002`, ADRV9003, or ADRV9004.
