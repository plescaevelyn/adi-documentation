EVAL-CN0269-SDPZ
=================

High Performance Multi-Channel Data Acquisition System.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0269 <CN0269>` is a high performance industrial signal level
multi-channel data acquisition circuit that can process 16 channels of
single-ended inputs or 8 channels of differential inputs with up to
18-bit resolution.

A single channel can be sampled at up to 1.33 MSPS with 18-bit resolution.
A channel-to-channel switching rate of 250 kHz between all input channels
provides 16-bit performance.

The signal processing circuit combined with a simple 4-bit up-down binary
counter provides a cost-effective way to realize channel-to-channel switching
without an FPGA, CPLD, or high speed processor. The counter can be programmed
to count up or count down for sequentially sampling multiple channels, or can
be loaded with a fixed binary word for sampling a single channel.
