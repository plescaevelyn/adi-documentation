Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the hardware setup of the demo divided into three phases:
**node board assembly**, **gateway assembly**, and **environment assembly**

**Sensor board assembly** involves connecting the :adi:`EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ` to
the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ`. This phase is to be repeated for each sensor board.
**Gateway assembly** involves setting up the RAK5146 PiHAT and the Raspberry Pi 4
as the concentrator hardware, allowing data transmission from the sensor boards
to the host PC. Lastly, **environment assembly** involves building the setup
that will simulate water flow across pipes.

      to the water pump in order to vary water flow as needed for the demo.

.. note::

   Once the sensor boards, gateway, and environment are all assembled, proceed
   to `Software Setup`_ to configure the sensor boards, gateway, and the
   application server.

Software Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the steps listed below. **Make sure that all
   requirements under** `Software Requirements`_ **are met, with all needed software
   downloaded and installed.**

This section describes the software setup of the demo divided into five phases:
**configuring the sensor board**, **imaging the SD card with ChirpStack OS**,
**configuring the gateway**, **setting up a self-hosted application server**,
and **connecting a sensor node to the gateway**.

**Configuring the sensor board** involves uploading the appropriate firmware
to the sensor board using the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter and
obtaining the board's DevEUI. To prepare the gateway, **imaging the SD card
with ChirpStack OS** involves flashing the ChirpStack Gateway OS to the
Raspberry Pi 4's micro SD card, while **configuring the gateway** involves
creating the gateway through the ChirpStack Network Server.

To configure the GUI, **setting up a self-hosted application server** involves
configuring the Host PC, installing the GUI, and accessing the gateway. Lastly,
**connecting a sensor node to the gateway** involves creating a device for each
board and accessing the GUI.

#. Open command prompt or terminal on the Host PC.
#. On the terminal, enter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ssh admin@192.168.0.1
#. SSH connection will ask for the password input. Use below credentials:

   - **Username:** admin
   - **Password:** admin
   - **StaticIP:** 192.168.0.1
#. Once connected, check the assigned ChirpStack IP by typing ``ifconfig``.

   .. image:: images/chirpstack_ip.png
      :align: center
#. This will show all configs, look for **eth0** and **save the IP address** assigned to it.

   .. image:: images/eth0_ip.png
      :align: center

   .. tip::

      In this example, the IP assigned is **169.254.117.207**. This will be used in
      **Installing the GUI and Accessing the Gateway** under
      `Setting up a Self-Hosted Application Server`_.
#. Open the Raspberry Pi terminal, then enter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo gateway-config

   This will **open an SSH client** to configure the gateway.

**Navigating the SSH client**

#. In the main menu, choose **Setup concentrator shield**.
#. Choose **RAK5146 (with GNSS)**. Click **OK**.

Setting up a Self-Hosted Application Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   Make sure that the **Raspberry Pi (powered on) and Host PC are still connected**
   through the LAN cable.

   This phase will require
   :dokuwiki:`ADI Wireless Sensor Hub Standalone Software (Rev 1.0.3) <_media/resources/eval/user-guides/longrangewirelessradio/wireless_sensor_hub.zip>`
   downloaded and extracted.

**Configuring the Host PC for the Gateway**

#. Access **Advanced Firewall settings** in your computer.

   .. image:: images/advance_firewall_settings.png
      :align: center
#. Create a new **Inbound Rule**.

   .. image:: images/inbound_rule_1.png
      :align: center
#. **Configure the Inbound Rule** as shown below.

   Step-by-step configuration of a new ChirpStack Inbound Rule:

**Installing the GUI and Accessing the Gateway**

#. Run the :dokuwiki:`ADI Wireless Sensor Hub Standalone Software <_media/resources/eval/user-guides/longrangewirelessradio/wireless_sensor_hub.zip>`
   with administrator privileges. This will start the initialization process
   and run the process on your PC.
#. Check and **save the IP address assigned to the Raspberry Pi gateway**.
   The server will show all connections available; select the IP of the
   connector you used.

   .. tip::

      In this example, it is the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter.

      .. image:: images/ip_address.png
         :align: center

      This information will be used in **Setting up a Local Host URL for the
      Application Server** under `Connecting a Sensor Node to the Gateway`_
      to integrate data from the gateway to the GUI.
#. Use the assigned ChirpStack IP address saved earlier to access its
   configuration interface by **adding the ChirpStack Port (8080)** to the
   end of IP address. Open a page in the browser using **[saved IP address]:8080**
   as the URL.

   .. tip::

      In this example, the saved IP address is 169.254.117.207. Hence, the URL
      would be **169.254.117.207:8080**.

      If you haven't saved the IP address, **revisit steps 3 to 7** in Opening
      the SSH client under `Configuring the Gateway`_.
#. This will open the login page. Enter the same credentials we used to
   establish an SSH connection with the ChirpStack Gateway.

   .. image:: images/log_in_page.png
      :align: center

Connecting a Sensor Node to the Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
