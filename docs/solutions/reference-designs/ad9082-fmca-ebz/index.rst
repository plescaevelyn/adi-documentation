Hardware Overview
-----------------

The AD9082-FMCA-EBZ shares the same PCB layout as the AD9081-FMCA-EBZ. The
key difference is the mounted MxFE device: the AD9082-FMCA-EBZ carries the
:adi:`AD9082` (4D2AC: 4 DACs, 2 ADCs), while the AD9081-FMCA-EBZ carries the
:adi:`AD9081` (4D4AC: 4 DACs, 4 ADCs).

Board summary:

- **Power delivery**: via FMC connector (uModule and LDO regulators)
- **Analog front-end balun**: BALH-0009SMG
- **Clock input balun**: SMP + BAL-0416
- **On-board crystal oscillator**: 100 MHz (used with on-board HMC7044)

:adi:`UG-1829 <media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad9081-9082-9986-9988-ug-1829.pdf>`.

Thermal Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`AD9082` can consume up to 13 W in some operating modes, causing die
temperature to approach its 120 °C maximum. A heat sink with integrated fan is
shipped with the evaluation board. Install the fan/heat sink before first use:

1. Remove the blue frame clip by lifting the metal tab free.
2. Peel off the thin plastic tape to expose the adhesive on the heat sink base.
3. Center the heat sink over the IC package, clear of the RF baluns, and press
   firmly for 10 seconds.
4. Connect the fan power cable.

The fan starts spinning when power is applied. If the fan does not spin, the
two mounting screws may be over-tightened — loosen them slightly with a
Phillips screwdriver.

ACE Plugin Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download and install
   `ACE <https://www.analog.com/en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-development-platforms/ace-software.html>`__
   if not already installed.
2. Download the AD9081/AD9082 ACE plugin from the
   :adi:`EVAL-AD9082 software section <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-AD9082.html#eb-relatedsoftware>`
   or install it via ACE's Plugin Manager (Tools > Manage Plug-Ins).
3. Connect the ADS9-V2EBZ to the PC via a USB 3.0 cable and power it on.
4. Launch ACE. The AD9081/AD9082 plugin icon should appear on the start page
   if the hardware is detected.

Clocking Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The evaluation board supports two clocking modes:

- **On-board clocking (HMC7044 + on-chip PLL)**: The on-board 100 MHz crystal
  oscillator feeds the HMC7044 clock chip, which generates the DAC/ADC clocks
  and FPGA SERDES reference clocks. This is the default mode and requires no
  external clock source.
- **External direct clock**: An external clock source is connected directly to
  the MxFE device, bypassing the HMC7044 and on-chip PLL. This mode supports
  a wider range of operating configurations but requires external
  instrumentation.

Refer to
:adi:`UG-1829 <media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad9081-9082-9986-9988-ug-1829.pdf>`
for details on switching between clocking modes.

Setting Up a Narrowband Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure configures the :adi:`AD9082` in a single-band
250 MSPS I/Q data rate setup with direct RF sampling. The on-board HMC7044
and on-chip PLL provide the DAC and ADC clocks.

8. Connect a signal generator to any ADC input. Set the frequency to
   3.207 GHz (the NCO is tuned to 3.2 GHz). Adjust the amplitude to achieve
   approximately -1 dBFS at the ADC input.

**Setting up DAC output with DPG Lite:**

9. Open DPG Downloader Lite. Select a Single Tone waveform and configure the
   GUI for the desired output frequency.
10. Press the **Play** button to enable the DAC output.
11. Use an SMA cable to connect a DAC output to an ADC input on the
    evaluation board for an external loopback test. Capture the FFT in ACE
    to verify the DAC output.

Setting Up a Wideband Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The wideband mode configures the :adi:`AD9082` in a single-band 1000 MSPS
I/Q data rate setup with direct RF sampling. The setup procedure is similar
to the narrowband case, with different Quick Configuration parameters.

.. figure:: wideband_setup.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

   Wideband mode setup block diagram

In the Quick Configuration section, set the JESD204 parameters for the higher
data rate and update the clock configuration accordingly. Click **Apply** and
wait for the device to be configured. Then proceed to DPG Lite setup and ADC
FFT capture as described in the narrowband procedure above.

ADC Performance Note
--------------------

The :adi:`AD9082` ADC noise performance depends on the operating configuration.
When the DACs are active (transceiver mode), ADC noise is higher than in
receive-only mode. The figures below show the ADC FFT at 2.7 GHz (-1 dBFS)
under each condition:

.. figure:: ad9082_2p7ghz_trxmodefft.png
   :align: center

   2.7 GHz -1 dBFS tone: AD9082 configured as a transceiver (DACs ON)

Programmable Filter (PFILT)
---------------------------

The :adi:`AD9082` includes a Programmable FIR Filter (PFILT) that can be used
for bandpass compensation and ADC response equalization. PFILT coefficients are
designed in MATLAB using the
`High Speed Converter Toolbox <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/HighSpeedConverterToolbox>`__
and loaded into the ACE plugin in hexadecimal format (2's complement).

To use the PFILT:

1. Design the compensation filter in MATLAB using
   ``MxFEADCCompensationFilterDesign_BPF.m`` from the HighSpeedConverterToolbox.
2. Convert the MATLAB-generated decimal coefficients to 2's complement
   hexadecimal format.
3. In the ACE plugin chip view, open the Programmable Filter configuration
   block, select the filter mode (Real N Tap for I or Q), and load the
   coefficient file.
4. Click "Configure Filter Block" and wait several seconds for the
   coefficients to load into the PFILT hardware.
5. Proceed to the Analysis view to capture an FFT and verify the filter
   response.

Refer to :adi:`UG-1829 <media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad9081-9082-9986-9988-ug-1829.pdf>`
for the full bandwidth ADC use case configuration required before loading PFILT
coefficients.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Board Not Functioning Properly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Verify the evaluation board is firmly seated in the FMC connector.
- After ACE programs the FPGA, power is supplied to the evaluation board.
  Confirm that all power-rail LEDs are lit.

.. figure:: ceboard_power_rail_led.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 500

   LEDs denoting power to the various rails on the evaluation board

- Verify the eRPC server connected successfully: the Chip Info UID should
  read a non-zero value. If UID reads 0x0, power-cycle the board and restart
  all software.

ACE Is Slow to Capture Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use a USB 3.0 cable between the ADS9-V2EBZ board and the PC.
- Connect to a USB 3.0 port on the PC.
- Restart all software and hardware if the issue persists.

Unable to Capture Data After Device Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only four of six LEDs are lit on the FPGA board after device setup, data
capture may have failed.

.. figure:: ads9v2_unsuccessful_capture.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   LED status on ADS9-V2EBZ following an unsuccessful data capture

When using an external direct clock:

- Verify the clock and refclock frequencies are set as described in UG-1829.
- Check all cable connections are secure.
- If the problem persists, open DPG Lite, download a tone, then retry capture.
  A successful capture shows all LEDs lit.

HMC7044 Configuration Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "HMC7044 Configuration Error" appears in ACE when the selected mode
requires a reference frequency that cannot be generated from the on-board
100 MHz crystal oscillator via the HMC7044. Not all modes in UG-1578 are
achievable with the on-board clocking.

.. figure:: hmc7044_config_error.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500

   HMC7044 Configuration Error (REFCLK value cannot be supported using a
   100 MHz crystal oscillator)

To use such modes, switch to an external direct clock, which bypasses the
HMC7044.

ACE Does Not Auto-Detect Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the hardware is not auto-detected after powering the ADS9-V2EBZ and
starting ACE, try a different USB 3.0 cable before reinstalling the plugin or
the full ACE package.
