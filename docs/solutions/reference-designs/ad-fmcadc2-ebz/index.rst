AD-FMCADC2-EBZ
===============

.. warning::

   Support for the AD-FMCADC2-EBZ is discontinued starting with the 2022_R2
   ADI Kuiper Linux release and it will not be supported in future releases.
   The last release with pre-built files is **2021_r2**. Check the
   :doc:`Kuiper Linux </linux/kuiper/index>` page for all releases.
   The HDL project source code can still be found on the
   :git-hdl:`hdl_2021_r2 <hdl_2021_r2:projects/fmcadc2>` release branch.

The :adi:`AD-FMCADC2-EBZ` is a high speed data acquisition board featuring
the :adi:`AD9625` single channel ADC at 2500 MSPS, in an FMC form factor
which supports the JESD204B high speed serial interface. This board meets most
of the FMC specifications in terms of mechanical size, mounting hole locations,
and more.

The :adi:`AD9625` is a 12-bit monolithic sampling analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) that operates at conversion rates of up to 2.5 GSPS. This product is
designed for sampling wide bandwidth analog signals up to the second Nyquist
zone. The combination of wide input bandwidth, high sampling rate, and excellent
linearity of the AD9625 is ideally suited for spectrum analyzers, data
acquisition systems, and a wide assortment of military electronics
applications, such as radar and jamming/antijamming measures.

The card is mechanically (width/depth, but not height) and electrically
compliant to the FMC standard (ANSI/VITA 57.1).

This board is targeted to use the ADI reference designs that work with Xilinx
development systems. ADI provides complete source (HDL and software) to
recreate those projects, but may not provide enough information to port this to
a custom platform.

Contains
--------

The card contains:

- :adi:`AD9625` 12-bit ADC with sampling speeds of up to 2500 MSPS, with a
  JESD204B digital interface.
- :adi:`ADP7104` 20 V, 500 mA, low noise, CMOS LDO
- :adi:`ADP1753` low dropout linear regulator, 1.6 V to 3.6 V input, up to
  800 mA output current
- :adi:`ADP2119` 2 A, 1.2 MHz, synchronous step-down DC-to-DC regulator
- :adi:`ADP1741` 2 A, low Vin, low dropout, CMOS linear regulator
- :adi:`ADR280` ultralow power high PSRR voltage reference

Note for Revision C
--------------------

If you have a revision C board as indicated in etch next to the white scratch
pad area of the PCB, it is recommended to write to the Serial Output Adjust
Register. If you are using the reference design this is done for you. Otherwise
when you configure the AD9625 it is suggested that you increase the serial
output emphasis by writing to register 0x015 bits 5:4 either 10 or 11.

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

The reference design includes the device data capture via the JESD204B serial
interface and the SPI interface. The samples are written to the external
DDR-DRAM. It allows programming the device and monitoring its internal
registers via SPI.

Specifications
--------------

The AD-FMCADC2-EBZ board's primary purpose is to quickly and easily connect to
an FMC carrier platform and start collecting data using the AD9625. The board
is designed to be easy to use. Out of the box the board will self power and
self clock when connected to an FMC carrier. The only other required equipment
is your chosen signal source to provide an input signal to "Ain".

This rapid prototyping board also has 4 vertically mounted SMA connectors.
These are labeled SYSREF IN and SYSREF OUT. These are to enable
synchronization of multiple AD-FMCADC2-EBZ boards together using
characteristics of the JESD204B high speed serial interface between the AD9625
and FPGA.

Clocking
~~~~~~~~

The AD-FMCADC2-EBZ provides multiple options for clocking the AD9625. The
default configuration of the board clocks the ADC using an on-board 2.5 GHz,
low noise, crystal oscillator. This oscillator is then routed through a wide
band transformer producing the differential clock for the ADC.

Alternatively, the oscillator can be disconnected and an external clock source
connected by only changing two components on the board. A single ended clock
connected to the CLK+ input would then be routed through the transformer in
the same way.

Finally, the option exists to connect a differential clock to the board using
both the CLK+ and CLK- inputs. Then referencing the schematic, make the
component changes to directly route the differential input bypassing the
transformer.

Front End
~~~~~~~~~

The AD-FMCADC2-EBZ uses a passive front end designed for very wide bandwidth.
A single ended input needs to be provided to "Ain". A 500 kHz to 6 GHz
broadband balun then converts the input signal to differential.

Eye Scan
~~~~~~~~

The JESD204B eye scan for this board can be found at
:dokuwiki:`JESD Eye Scan <resources/tools-software/linux-software/jesd_eye_scan>`.

Bare Metal Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For bare metal (no-OS) development, the required software tools include the
Xilinx Vivado and SDK toolchain. A UART terminal (e.g., Tera Term) at
115200 baud (8N1) is required for console output.

After building the HDL project in Vivado, the Xilinx SDK can be used to create
an empty application project, then import the no-OS source files into the
``src`` folder. The project can be debugged using the Vivado Hardware Manager
and the integrated logic analyzer (ILA) debug cores.
