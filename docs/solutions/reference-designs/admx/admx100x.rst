General Description
-------------------

The ADMX1001 and ADMX1002 modules are ultra-low distortion and low-noise signal
generators. They have a frequency range of up to 40 kHz when not using the
digital pre-distortion (DPD) algorithm. If the DPD algorithm is enabled for
signal generation, they can generate tones up to 20 kHz with -130dB typical of
total harmonic distortion (THD) at 1 kHz. In addition to signal generation, the
ADMX1001 includes a differential input acquisition channel to measure a signal
of choice.

These modules can be evaluated with a single GUI to generate different signals. The PC GUI connects to an SDP controller board via USB that has established SPI communication to the module. The recommended controller board is the :adi:`SDP_H1 <sdp-h1>` which connects to the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ's FMC connector.

Setup
~~~~~

Follow the steps below to set up the full evaluation board.

-  Check that the Jumper & Switch settings match the desired configuration in Table 2.
-  Connect the ADMX1001 or ADM1002 module to the module connector (P5) on the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ evaluation board.
-  Connect the SDP_H1 controller board to the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ evaluation board's FMC connector (P1).
-  Connect the SDP controller USB to the computer.
-  Apply the SDP-H1 board power.
-  Apply the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ power.

::

     *After the power is applied, the “READY” LED turns on and then turns off. Then the “DONE” LED turns on and the “READY” LED turns on again.
     Caution: If both LEDs do not turn on, power cycle the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ evaluation board.
     * Configure the LOOPBACK switch (S1).
     * If using the ADMX1002 or there is a need to view the source outputs via the OUTP and OUTN SMAs when using the ADMX1001, slide S1 on the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ to the “LOOPBACK OFF” position.
     * If using the ADMX1001, the signal generator outputs can be looped back into the acquisition channel inputs by sliding S1 on the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ to the “LOOPBACK ON” position The SMA outputs (OUTP and OUTN) and inputs (INP and INN) connectors are disengaged in this mode.
     * Start the ADMX100X GUI.
     * The GUI will display "Connected" in green text at the bottom left corner if the connection was successful.
     Caution: If the GUI does not connect at this step, disconnect the GUI and power off and on the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ evaluation board by removing and then reinserting the power adapter. Then start the GUI again.

   *Figure 4. Complete Evaluation Setup with SDP-H1*

Using the SDP-S or SDP-B with the SDP-I-PMOD Controller Boards
--------------------------------------------------------------

The recommended controller board to use with the EVAL-ADMX100X evaluation system is the :adi:`SDP_H1 <sdp-h1>`. However, it is possible to use the :adi:`SDP_S <sdp-s>` or :adi:`SDP_B <sdp-b>` with the :adi:`SDP-I-PMD <sdp-pmd-ib1z>` interposer board to connect to the ADMX1002B module.

.. important::

   The SDP-I-PMD is used in conjunction with either the SDP-S or the SDP-B
   boards to establish SPI communication to the ADMX1002 using only the SPI PMOD
   connector. The SDP-H1 performs the same function and can be plugged into the
   FMC connector on the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ.

   
   There are additional connections to the FMC connector that are required for
   some features, including the ability to shift the VCM of the generated output
   using the GUI, as well as access an additional SPI bus to control the
   acquisition module on the ADMX1001. Therefore, we recommend using the SDP-H1
   controller board in most cases to access all features and both module boards
   (ADMX1001B and ADMX1002B). However, if the user is evaluating the ADMX1002
   and can shift the VCM of the output manually, the SDP-S/SDP-B and SDP-I-PMD
   boards can be used. This setup cannot be used to evaluate the ADMX1001B.

Quick Start with the SDP_S/SDP_B and SDP_I_PMOD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to Figure 2 for the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ Connector layout.

-  Source/DAC SPI PMOD header: The SDP-S or SDP-B will communicate to the module via SPI through the Source/DAC SPI PMOD header (P2). The P2 bottom row pins 1-6 are "SS_MOSI_MISO_SCLK_GND\_+3.3V"
-  When using these controller boards, the output common-mode voltage can only
   be adjusted by providing external VCM at pin 9 of P7. The P4 jumper should
   also be inserted at 2-3 position as indicated in Table 2.

Equipment

ADMX100X General Description
----------------------------

The ADMX100X module shown in Figure 8 is an ultra-low distortion and low noise
autonomous digitally controller sinewave signal generator, generating the purest
sinusoidal differential signals in its class by exploiting a digital
pre-distortion (DPD) algorithm, which is a patented method for sensing and
correcting its own output. The difference between ADMX1001 and ADMX1002 is that
ADMX1001 has the added capability of acquiring signal as shown on the simplified
block diagram in Figure 9.

Source Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the ADMX1001 and ADMX1002 offer a multi-tone frequency range of up to 40
kHz. The ADMX100X can perform the digital pre-distortion (DPD) algorithm to
provide an ultra-low distortion and low noise signal from 30Hz to 20kHz. The
module generates an ultra-low distortion performance up to −130dB at 1 kHz with
DPD, and −118dB at 1 kHz without DPD. The ADMX100X module has the capability to
perform in DC, dual tone, and arbitrary waveform generation mode.

For applications that require different voltage and current levels, the sense
lines can be connected to an external buffer or level-shifting circuitry to
permit the entire forward signal chain to be corrected.

The module is configurable through a flexible digital interface allows for easy
integration into any system. In addition, ATE control bus lines are available
for maximum control of the signal in timing-critical applications.

Acquisition Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADMX1001 module offers an acquisition channel input, which can be accessed
using the secondary ADC interface to read the conversion data directly.

ADMX1001 can act as master or slave when supporting coherent test signal
generation and offers an auxiliary ADC input, operating at 256 ksps.

The highly integrated data acquisition solution provides 7 programmable gain
options with a maximum input range of ±7.5V differential and a maximum input
common mode range of ±7V. A 4th order anti-aliasing filter provides rejection up
to −130dB. The total dynamic range of the acquisition channel is up to 128dB
with a −115dB typical THD with a 1kHz input tone at full scale.

Operation Modes
---------------

Single Tone Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ADMX100X module is specially designed to generate an ultra-high purity sine
waveform from 30 Hz up to 20 kHz by a patented digital pre-distortion (DPD)
algorithm method. In addition, the module can generate high-purity signals up to
40kHz without DPD.

Default Mode (without DPD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the default mode when a new frequency and/or amplitude is loaded into
the register, and the generate register or trigger pin is toggled. The ADMX100X
module performance exceeds the native performance of the components due to its
architecture. This is the operation mode for arbitrary waveform generation as
well.

With DPD Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ultra-high performance is needed the digital pre-distortion (DPD) algorithm
can be enabled by software or hardware. The DPD process requires no external
reference inputs and exploits a patented differential temporal and amplitude
sensing method. When combined with our novel DSP algorithm, this eliminates the
electrical measurement errors that would normally limit the performance. The DPD
algorithm range frequency goes from 30Hz up to 20kHz, with an amplitude range of
up to 3.62VRMS. Figure 4 shows the ADMX100X module THD before and after DPD.
Moreover, Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the FFT of an ADMX100X module at 1kHz with
2Vrms before and after DPD.

Sense Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DPD algorithm of ADMX100X requires the sense inputs to be connected to the
output of ADMX1001 and ADMX1002 which will be used in the process routine of
ADMX1001 and ADMX1002 to generate an ultra-high purity sine waveform. The sense
connection can be used to combine a user buffer circuit as part of the signal
generation in the DPD process by connecting the sense input to the output of the
user’s buffer stage.

   *Figure 12. FFT spectrum with 2Vrms at 1kHz after DPD*

DC Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ADMX100X is capable of generating differential DC output signals up to 11.3V DC
between Vp and Vn. The output level can be adjusted in 1µV resolution steps, and
the software will verify if the entered parameters are valid by using the valid
register. The DC output will be continuously generated after the run command is
received and can be stopped by sending a stop command.

Dual-tone Waveform Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two sine wave tones can be generated from 30Hz to 20kHz. The dual-tone waveform
generation can be performed in burst mode or continuous mode. The dual-tone
waveform frequency resolution can be programmed with 1 µHz resolution while the
amplitudes can be programmed with 1 µV resolution.

Arbitrary Waveform Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An arbitrary waveform can be programmed by the user. The AWG signal can be
programmed up to 20s long and will be stored in volatile memory. Continuous AWG
generation can be performed by looping back the waveform stored in memory.
ADMX100X contains a 27kHz low pass filter on its output allowing AWG waveforms
to be generated within this band. Signals generated in the band will be within a
5% tolerance.

Acquisition Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The highly integrated data acquisition solution provides 7 programmable gain
options with a maximum input range of ±7.5V differential and a maximum input
common mode range of ±7V. A 4th order anti-aliasing filter provides rejection up
to −130dB. The total dynamic range of the acquisition channel is up to 128dB
with a −115dB typical THD with a 1kHz input tone at full scale.

SPI Control
~~~~~~~~~~~

An overview of the SPI control mode features is as follows:

-  Standard SPI Mode 3 interface for register access, where the ADC always behaves as an SPI slave.
-  Indication of a new conversion via the DRDY pin output.
-  A second method allows the user to merge the ready signal within the DOUT output stream, which allows a reduction in the number of lines across an isolation barrier.
-  Reading back conversions can be performed by writing 8 bits to address the ADC register and reading back the result from the register.
-  Continuous readback mode, which is enabled via an SPI write. There is no need to supply the 8 bits to address the ADC_DATA register (Register 0x2C). Data readback occurs on the application of SCLK. The DRDY pin indicates that a conversion result is complete and can be used to trigger a readback of the conversion result.
-  In continuous read-back mode, there is the option to append either the 8-bit
   status header or an 8-bit CRC check, or both.

Additional Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Burst/Continuous Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In burst mode, the tone will only be generated for a defined length of time
while in continuous mode the waveforms will be generated continuously until the
STOP command is sent.

Profiles
^^^^^^^^

Once a digital pre-distortion (DPD) algorithm is used for a given frequency or
amplitude, the DPD parameters can be saved into the non-volatile profile memory.
If you change the parameters of your signal without storing the previous DPD
parameters, these parameters will be lost once a new frequency or amplitude is
loaded into the module. When generating a new combination of frequency and
amplitude (also known as a profile) DPD algorithm can be performed to generate a
high-purity signal and can be stored to be later recalled. Up to 16 such signals
can be stored and can be recalled easily by hardware or software. This allows
fast-high purity frequency switching. Profiles 1 through 15 can store any signal
type (single tone, single tone with DPD, DC, dual tone, etc.), but profile 16 is
reserved for an AWG signal type only.

ADMX100X Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The DPD algorithm cannot be used for frequencies above 20 kHz.
-  The DPD algorithm does not work with signals lower than 100mVrms.
-  Frequencies above 40 kHz cannot be selected.
-  Amplitude above 3.5Vrms cannot be set.
-  Only voltages below 3.5Vrms can be set for frequencies less than 10.5 kHz.

ADMX100X GUI Waveform Plot Options (Captured and Spectrum)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The plots to display the acquired data, shown in Figure 23, have the following
elements:

-  Captured waveform Graph: Displays the captured samples vs. time to show the captured waveform to the user.
-  Spectrum waveform graph: Displays the frequency-domain plot of the acquired samples using signal-to-spectrum domain transforms.
-  Waveform Graph control panel: This control panel can be used to scale the graph as needed.
-  Waveform Graph Axes: The Axes dropdown has two options “Auto” and “Fixed”. If
   we use “Fixed” axes we can manually set the limits of the graph by clicking
   on the numbers at the edge of the graph and typing in the required value of
   the axis limit. The “Auto” setting will automatically scale the axes to fit
   the waveform in the window.

Custom Bin Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of bins used for the fundamental, harmonics, and other components in
AC performance calculations, such as SNR, THD, and THD+N, can be adjusted. This
flexibility of bin selection can help reduce the effect of spectral leakage,
improving AC performance accuracy, particularly when analyzing noise and
harmonic distortion.

To do this, go to the GUI folder (C:\\Analog Devices\\Admx100xEvaluationSoftware-Rel2.3.0\\GUI), open **SpectrumSettings.json**, and adjust the number of bins as necessary.

After saving the spectrum settings, run the Acquisition channel to apply the
changes, and it should reflect to the updated AC performance.

Applications Information
------------------------

ATE Control Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) control interface can be used to provide a
simple protocol for initiating an instruction to perform a DPD calibration or
signal generation by driving and monitoring pins on the module. The test
parameters, like the amplitude and frequency of the signal, must still be loaded
through SPI.

**Table 3. ATE Pin Assignment and Function**

========= ===========
Connector Description
========= ===========
EN        Input
READY     Output
TRIG      Input
VALID     Output
CAL       Input
OT        Output
SYNC_MODE Input
\
SYNC_IN   Input
SYNC_OUT  Output
========= ===========

Test Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two possible test sequences: Signal Generation & DPD Calibration. It
is not necessary to run a DPD calibration phase before every signal generation
sequence. The following examples use all the module's ATE control pins. However,
the user can choose to use none, only the TRIG line, or more depending on the
level of control required.

Signal Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The procedure below should be followed for stimulus generation:

-  Turn-on power supplies to modules (+3.3V & +/-9V).
-  Set Enable (EN) High - Enables internal supplies within the module.
-  Wait until module initialization has completed (READY=1).
-  Load serial test configuration data.
-  Low to high TRIG transition initiates the test sequence.
-  Module outputs synchronization (SYNC_OUT) pulses over the period the VALID signal is held high.
-  Low to High transition of the VALID signal indicates the start of the stimulus.
-  High to Low transition of the VALID signal indicates the end of the stimulus.

The same test can be run multiple times without reloading the configuration by
repeating steps 5 through 8. Once new test configuration data has been reloaded
via SPI, the new configuration will need to be revalidated before signal
generation can resume without error.

Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~

To achieve the highest signal purity, a DPD calibration phase must be run at
least once before generating an output signal. The DPD calibration data is
normally stored in volatile memory and therefore must be re-run after every
power supply sequence or once there is a change in the amplitude, frequency, and
common-mode voltage settings.

The procedure below should be followed for calibration:

-  Enable power supplies to modules (+3.3V & +/-9V).
-  Set Enable (EN) High - Enables internal supplies within the module.
-  Wait until module initialization has completed (READY=1).
-  Load serial test configuration data.
-  Set CAL signal High to start module DPD Calibration procedure.
-  Monitor the high to low transition of the VALID signal to indicate the end of calibration.
-  Start generating an output signal.

Coherent Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coherent sampling describes the sampling of a periodic signal, where an integer
number of its cycles fit into a predefined sampling window. This technique is
very useful to get the best achievable results when evaluating the dynamic
performance of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To facilitate coherent
sampling, the module can synchronize its signal generation to an external clock
by doing the following:

-  Connect the SYNC_Mode pin to GND by inserting a jumper in the 2-3 position of P12.
-  Connect the SYNC_IN pin to the SMA input by inserting a jumper in the 2-3 position of P13.
-  Apply a 100 MHz external clock to J7 to synchronize the generated signal to
   the external clock.

Notes:

-  The external clock must be turned on first before applying power to the EVAL-ADMX100X-FMCZ.
-  Take note of the logic level limits below for the SYNC_IN and SYNC_OUT pins.
-  Trigger needs to be set high to start generating the signal.
-  During Coherent Sampling, SYNC_IN must have a 100 MHz clock frequency with a 50% duty cycle.
-  Although less common, coherent sampling may also be performed by
   synchronizing the analyzer from the clock generated from the module
   (SYNC_OUT).
