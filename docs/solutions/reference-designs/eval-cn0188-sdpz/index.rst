EVAL-CN0188-SDPZ
=================

Current Monitoring for -48 V Telecom Power Systems.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0188 <CN0188>` is a circuit that monitors current in individual
channels of -48 V systems to better than 1% accuracy. The load current passes
through a shunt resistor, which is external to the circuit. The shunt resistor
value is chosen so that the shunt voltage is approximately 50 mV at maximum
load current. The entire circuit operates on a single +3.3 V supply.

The :adi:`AD7171` is a very low power, 16-bit, analog-to-digital converter
(ADC). It contains a precision, 16-bit, sigma-delta ADC and an on-chip
oscillator. The measurement result from the AD7171 is provided as a digital
code utilizing a simple 2-wire, SPI-compatible serial interface. Optional
galvanic isolation is provided by the :adi:`ADuM5402 <ADUM5402>` quad channel
isolator. In addition to isolating the output data, the digital isolator can
also supply isolated +3.3 V for the circuit.

The :adi:`ADA4051-2` is a CMOS, micropower, zero-drift operational amplifier
utilizing an innovative chopping technique. This amplifier features rail-to-rail
input/output swing and extremely low offset voltage while operating from a
1.8 V to 5.5 V power supply.

The :adi:`ADR381` is a precision 2.500 V band gap voltage reference featuring
high accuracy, high stability, and low power consumption in a tiny footprint.
It is a micropower, low dropout voltage (LDV) device that provides a stable
output voltage from supplies as low as 300 mV above the output voltage.

The EVAL-CN0188-SDPZ board connects to ADI's System Demonstration Platform
(SDP) and is powered by a +6 V supply or +6 V wall wart.

  input.
- Terminal block **J3** is the test point for 6 V DC output.
- Terminal block **J4** contains the input terminals for R\ :sub:`shunt` and
  load to ground.

Test Setup
~~~~~~~~~~

   :width: 600px
   :align: center

   EVAL-CN0188-SDPZ test setup diagram

1. Connect the 120-pin connector on the EVAL-CN0188-SDPZ evaluation board to
   the connector marked **CON A** on the EVAL-SDP-CB1Z evaluation (SDP) board.

2. Connect a shunt resistor across the input terminals with a load to ground
   as indicated in the test setup diagram.

3. With power to the supply off, connect a +6 V power supply to the pins
   marked **+6V** and **GND** on the board.

   .. note::

      If available, a +6 V wall wart can be connected to the barrel connector
      on the board and used in place of the +6 V power supply.

4. Connect the USB cable supplied with the SDP board to the USB port on the PC.

5. Apply power to the +6 V supply (or wall wart) connected to the
   EVAL-CN0188-SDPZ evaluation board.

6. Launch the evaluation software.

7. Connect the USB cable from the PC to the USB mini connector on the SDP
   board.

.. important::

   Connect the **system ground** and the **PCB isolated ground** to guarantee
   correct voltage levels and operation. **Test point 31** and **test point 32**
   give access to the GND_ISO required to properly make this connection.

Installing the Evaluation Software
------------------------------------

1. Extract the file **CN0188_Evaluation_Software.zip** and open the file
   **setup.exe**.

   .. note::

      It is recommended that you install the CN0188 evaluation software to the
      default directory path
      **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Analog Devices\\CN0188\\** and all National
      Instruments products to **C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\**.
