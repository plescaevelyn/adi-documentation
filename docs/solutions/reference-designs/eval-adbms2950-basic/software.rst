Firmware
~~~~~~~~

Installing the Firmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Connect the microcontroller board (for this example, SDP-K1) to the host PC.
-  Go to the USB_TO_SPI_FIRMWARE directory and find the latest firmware.
-  Drag and drop the appropriate firmware file (e.g.,
   SDP_K1_PyBMS_USB_TO_SPI_Bytes_Debug_USB_Port.hex or usb-to-spi-max32690.hex)
   onto the corresponding MCU's USB drive (e.g., SDP USB drive) to update the
   firmware.

.. image:: images/usb_spi_firmware_list.png
   :align: center
   :width: 700

.. tip::

   This software setup uses the SDP-K1 as microcontroller board, but the
   :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL` microcontroller may also be used as alternative.


   In order to flash the firmware image on the :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL` MCU
   board, it needs to be connected to the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming
   adapter board.

.. collapsible:: **Click here for instructions on how to flash the firmware image using the MAX32625PICO**

   -  Access the `MAX32625PICO Firmware Repository <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images>`_ and download the image for the specific MCU (e.g., MAX32690).
   -  Do not connect the MAX32625PICO from the PC and the MCU board that you are using (e.g., AD-APARDMAX32690-SL, MAX32670 MCU base board).
   -  Plug the micro-USB cable only in the MAX32625PICO.
   -  Press the button on the MAX32625PICO and then plug the other end of the
      micro-USB cable into the PC. (Do not release the button until the
      MAINTENANCE drive is mounted).

   .. image:: images/max32625pico_flasher.png
      :align: center
      :width: 400

   -  Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
   -  Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
   -  After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced
      by a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and
      the MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware to the MAXIM MCU
      (e.g., AD-APARDMAX32690-SL, MAX32670 MCU base board) as indicated by step
      #3 in "Installing the Software".

   -  A log of diagnostic-specific data appears in the center of the screen.
   -  The log provides context for understanding why a diagnostic may have
      failed.

--------------

Custom GUI Configuration
------------------------

The configuration settings in the GUI's config.json file allow users to tailor
the software to their specific needs, providing a more customized and efficient
experience.

This section explores the three key settings: auto_detect_sdp,
limit_usb_polling, and display_user_manual_on_start - that users can adjust to
better align the software to their intended applications.

Key Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

auto_detect_sdp:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Purpose:** Determines whether the software automatically connects to all
   comports or requires manual selection of the NUCLEO comport.
-  **Default Setting:** true
-  **Modification:**

   -  Open the config.json file located in the base directory of the software.
   -  Locate the "auto_detect_sdp" setting and change its value to false.
   -  Save the changes.

limit_usb_polling:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Purpose:** Controls the poll rate of the NUCLEO comport, balancing CPU usage and sample rate.
-  **Default Setting:** false
-  **Modification:**

   -  Open the config.json file.
   -  Find the "limit_usb_polling" setting and change its value to true if a
      reduced poll rate is preferred.
   -  Save the changes.

display_user_manual_on_start:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Purpose:** Governs whether the user manual is displayed each time the software starts.
-  **Default Setting:** true
-  **Modification:**

   -  Open the config.json file.
   -  Locate the "display_user_manual_on_start" setting and change its value
      to false if you prefer not to see the manual on startup.
   -  Save the changes.

.. tip::

   By adjusting these configuration settings in the config.json file, users can
   optimize the software's behavior to better suit their requirements. Whether
   it's fine-tuning comport connections, managing CPU usage, or controlling the
   display of the user manual, these settings provide a flexible approach to
   enhancing the software's usability. Make sure to save your changes and
   restart the software for the modifications to take effect.
