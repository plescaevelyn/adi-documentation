Linux User Guide
=================

This guide describes how to connect the EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ to a Zedboard
running Linux, and use the two on-board :adi:`ADIN1320` PHYs as PHYs for the
network interfaces.

Hardware requirements
----------------------

For this setup you will need the following boards or hardware accessories:

* EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ
* `Zedboard - Zynq7000 development board <https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/zedboard/start>`__
* Cat5+ Ethernet cable(s)
* A 1000BASE-X or 100BASE-FX capable SFP module (optional, for testing fiber
  media on Port 0)
* SD card

Eval board setup
------------------

The EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ plugs directly into the Zedboard's FMC LPC connector;
no jumper wires are required.

The board carries two ADIN1320 PHYs, Port 0 (P0) and Port 1 (P1):

* **Port 0** supports either Copper (RJ45) or Fiber (SFP cage) media.
* **Port 1** supports Copper (RJ45) media only.

Both PHYs are managed over a single MDIO bus, driven by GEM1, that is shared
between Port 0 (address ``0x0``) and Port 1 (address ``0x8``); see the
``mdio`` node under ``&gem1`` in the devicetree. The MAC interface mode
(RGMII) is not configured over MDIO, though: it is fixed by hardware
strapping on the board, and this is the only mode supported by this
revision of the guide. The values below are the ADIN1320 hardware
configuration pin values (see the ADIN1320 datasheet, "Hardware
Configuration Pins" section) required for this mode and are provided as a
reference of what must be configured; no user action is needed to reproduce
them.

.. important::

   To use an SFP module on Port 0 instead of the RJ45 connector, insert it
   into the M1 cage, and short the **M1 (SFP_PWR)** jumper to power the SFP
   module.

.. figure:: adin1320_power.jpeg
   :width: 600
   :align: center

   Power jumpers (P21, P25, M1)

.. important::

   Jumper **P21** (uC_POWER) must be disconnected. This jumper supplies power
   to the on-board MCU, which can alternatively drive the MDIO bus instead of
   the FPGA over the FMC connector. Leaving P21 connected powers the MCU and
   creates a conflict with FMC/FPGA-based MDIO control.

.. important::

   Jumper **P25** selects between two power sources (USB or an external
   5 V-24 V supply). The FMC connector supplies power through a separate
   path unaffected by P25, so P25 can be left open when powering the board
   through the FMC connector.

.. important::

   On **Rev C** boards, the on-board EEPROM (U5) shares the same I2C bus as
   the SFP cage and is strapped to address ``0x50``, which collides with the
   I2C address used by the EEPROM on SFP modules. This prevents the host
   from reading the SFP module's EEPROM correctly. To use an SFP module on
   Rev C boards, disconnect pin 8 (VDD) of U5 -- e.g. by lifting the pin or
   cutting its trace -- or desolder U5 entirely.

SD card setup
--------------

Flash a Linux distribution image to an SD card.
:external+kuiper:doc:`Kuiper Linux <index>` is recommended, since it
contains everything (kernel and HDL images, devicetree, rootfs) needed to
get started.

#. Download the `Kuiper Linux v2.0.0 image
   <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/kuiper/releases/download/v2.0.0/image_2025-04-03-ADI-Kuiper-Linux-armhf.zip>`__.
#. Extract the archive and flash the ``.img`` file to the SD card, for
   example with `Balena Etcher <https://etcher.balena.io/>`__.
#. Download the `EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ artifacts archive
   <https://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/kuiper/adin1320/artifacts.zip>`__,
   which contains the ``uImage``, ``BOOT.BIN``, and ``devicetree.dtb`` built
   for this reference design.
#. Extract the artifacts archive and copy ``uImage``, ``BOOT.BIN``, and
   ``devicetree.dtb`` onto the BOOT partition of the SD card (the FAT
   partition mounted when the card is plugged into a PC), overwriting the
   files already present there.

Insert the SD card into the Zedboard and boot:

* Plug the EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ into the Zedboard's FMC LPC connector (with the
  board powered off).
* Connect the PC to the Zedboard (J14) using a micro USB cable.
* Connect the power adapter.
* Power on the board using the SW8 switch.
* Connect using a serial terminal emulator (e.g. ``tio`` for Linux or PuTTY
  for Windows). The UART settings are 115200/8N1. The ``CR after every LF``
  option may need to be enabled manually.
* Press enter if no boot log appears, since the board may have already
  booted.

Power off the board once boot is confirmed.

Testing the EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ
--------------------------------

With the EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ already connected to the Zedboard's FMC LPC
connector, connect an Ethernet cable to Port 1's RJ45 connector (or a Cat5+
cable/SFP module to Port 0). Power on the board and check that the link is
up:

.. shell::

   $ip a

Two network interfaces should be present, one for each ADIN1320 PHY (Port 0
on GEM1, Port 1 on GEM0). Once a link partner is connected, the corresponding
interface should show as ``UP,LOWER_UP``. Ethernet traffic can now be passed
through the network interface.

At this point, only the generic Ethernet PHY driver is being used. Unless
some of the ADIN13xx specific features are needed (frame checker counters,
MDI/MDIX settings via ``ethtool``), the ADIN1320 does not require a
device-specific Linux driver — it is supported by the mainline ``adin`` PHY
driver.

Testing scenarios
-------------------

The following scenarios exercise the ADIN1320 PHY and its Linux support.
Examples use ``eth0``; substitute the interface name that corresponds to the
port under test (Port 0 or Port 1).

.. important::

   ``ethtool`` and `phytool <https://github.com/wkz/phytool>`__ are not
   installed by default on the Kuiper rootfs. Install ``ethtool`` with:

   .. shell::

      $sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ethtool

   ``phytool`` is not packaged; build and install it from source:

   .. shell::

      $sudo apt install -y git build-essential
      $git clone https://github.com/wkz/phytool.git
      $cd phytool
      $make
      $sudo cp phytool mdio /usr/local/bin/

Link and traffic verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. shell::

   $ip a

Confirm the interface is ``UP,LOWER_UP``.

To verify frame transmission, assign a static IP address to the interface
and ping a link partner with a known, already-configured static IP on the
same subnet:

.. shell::

   $ip addr add 192.168.97.40/24 dev eth0
   $ping 192.168.97.10

After passing traffic, check that both RX and TX packet counters increment:

.. shell::

   $ip -s link show eth0

If only one side increments, this usually points to a MAC/PHY configuration
mismatch (speed, duplex, or interface mode).

Copper and fiber media testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Copper**: connect a Cat5+ cable between Port 0 or Port 1's RJ45 connector
  and a link partner, and verify link-up as above.
* **Fiber**: insert a 1000BASE-X capable SFP module into Port
  0's SFP cage, and verify link-up the same way. Fiber media is only
  available on Port 0.

.. important::

   **Troubleshooting**: on **U1** revisions of the ADIN1320, the PHY
   sometimes fails to detect a link with the PHY on the SFP module. If
   fiber link-up does not occur, work around this by either:

   * Inserting the SFP module before powering on/resetting the board, so it
     is already in place when the ADIN1320 comes out of reset during Linux
     boot; or
   * Connecting a Cat5+ cable to Port 0's RJ45 connector first, waiting for
     copper link-up, then disconnecting the cable and inserting the SFP
     module.

Link speed and duplex configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. shell::

   $ethtool -s eth0 speed 10 duplex full autoneg off
   $ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full autoneg off
   $ethtool -s eth0 autoneg on

MDI/MDIX configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. shell::

   $ethtool -s eth0 mdix auto # auto-mdix, MDI preferred by default
   $ethtool -s eth0 mdix off  # MDI mode manual
   $ethtool -s eth0 mdix on   # MDIX mode manual

PHY statistics (frame checker counters)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. shell::

   $ethtool --phy-statistics eth0

.. important::

   Do not confuse PHY statistics with MAC statistics, available separately
   via ``ethtool --statistics eth0`` or ``ethtool -S eth0``.

PHY register access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Low level register access can be done with `phytool
<https://github.com/wkz/phytool>`__, useful as a sanity check (e.g. reading
the PHY ID):

.. shell::

   $phytool read eth0/0/0x2
   $phytool read eth0/0/0x3

.. important::

   ``phytool`` can only access registers via Clause 22. Clause 45 is not
   supported by the PHY driver. Registers above address ``0x1f`` are MMD
   registers and require the indirect access sequence via registers ``0x10``
   and ``0x11``.

Compiling the Linux driver
-----------------------------

.. important::

   The mainline ``adin`` PHY driver (``CONFIG_ADIN_PHY``) does not yet
   support the ADIN1320. Until support is merged upstream, use the ``adin``
   driver from the ADI Linux kernel fork's :git-linux:`release/adin1320
   <release/adin1320:/>` branch (based on Linux 6.12), which also contains
   the devicetree for this reference design.

Set up the cross compile environment for Zynq (see the
:ref:`Linux kernel build guide <linux-kernel zynq>` for toolchain options),
then clone the ``release/adin1320`` branch and build the kernel, modules, and
devicetree:

.. shell::

   $git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/linux.git \
   $            --branch release/adin1320 --single-branch --depth=10 \
   $            -- linux
   $cd linux
   $export ARCH=arm
   $export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
   $make zynq_xcomm_adv7511_defconfig
   $make -j12 UIMAGE_LOADADDR=0x8000 uImage
   $make xilinx/zynq-zed-adin1320fmcz-rgmii.dtb
   $make modules -j12

This produces ``arch/arm/boot/uImage`` and
``arch/arm/boot/dts/xilinx/zynq-zed-adin1320fmcz-rgmii.dtb``. Copy them onto
the SD card's BOOT partition, renaming the devicetree to ``devicetree.dtb``:

.. shell::

   $cp arch/arm/boot/dts/xilinx/zynq-zed-adin1320fmcz-rgmii.dtb /media/$USER/BOOT/devicetree.dtb
   $cp arch/arm/boot/uImage /media/$USER/BOOT/uImage

Then follow the same process described in the **Testing the
EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ** section above to validate the board with the new kernel.
