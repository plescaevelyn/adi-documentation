The :adi:`EVAL-ADIN1320FMCZ` evaluation board is designed to simplify the
testing and integration of the :adi:`ADIN1320`, a low power, single port
Gigabit Ethernet physical layer (PHY) optimized for industrial applications.
The platform enables comprehensive evaluation of the ADIN1320 functionality,
including its Ethernet and serializer/deserializer (SerDes) interfaces. By
supporting the ADIN1320 copper and fiber Ethernet capabilities, the platform
allows evaluation of copper Ethernet (10BASE-Te, 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX,
1000BASE-T) as well as fiber and SerDes protocols (1000BASE-X, 100BASE-FX,
1000BASE-KX).

The evaluation board integrates two ADIN1320 PHYs, each connected to an RJ45
connector with integrated magnetics for copper connectivity. Both PHYs have
their media access control (MAC) I/O pins routed to a field programmable gate
array (FPGA) mezzanine card (FMC) connector, which allows seamless integration
with FMC-compatible FPGA or system on a chip (SoC) platforms.

.. note::

   The mainline ``adin`` PHY driver (``CONFIG_ADIN_PHY``), shared with the
   ADIN1200/ADIN1300 family, does not yet support the ADIN1320. Until support
   is merged upstream, use the ``adin`` driver from the ADI Linux kernel
   fork's :git-linux:`release/adin1320 <release/adin1320:/>` branch.
