Optical Gesture Sensor Demo
===========================

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0569-PMDZ` is a PMOD form factor circuit board that allows
evaluation of :adi:`ADPD1080` working in tandem with two :adi:`ADPD2140` to
create a Infrared Light Gesture Sensor. This example uses the
:adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` as a motherboard as well as
:git-no-OS:`no-OS repository <no-OS>` software implementing
an IIO server and :git-pyadi-iio:`pyadi-iio repository <pyadi-iio>`
code that runs on a host computer and implements gesture sensing algorithm.

General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The example software is divided in two parts:

- Firmware (written in C)
- Python application

The two parts work together to initialize the hardware, sample the system and
implement the gesture sensing algorithm. The firmware is a part of code written
in C language that runs on the controller on the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` and
initializes the hardware and runs an IIO server. The python application runs on
a host computer connected to the system via a USB serial connection and is
responsible for sampling the current passing through the photodiodes and
implement different algorithms with it, in this case gesture sensing.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

**Hardware**

- EVAL-ADICUP3029
- EVAL-CN0569-PMDZ
- Micro-USB to USB cable
- PC or Laptop with a USB port

**Software**

- :git-no-OS:`no-OS repository <no-OS>` and specifically the
  :git-no-OS:`example project <projects/iio_adpd1080>`
- :git-pyadi-iio:`pyadi-iio repository <pyadi-iio>` and specifically the
  :git-pyadi-iio:`examples <examples/cn0569>`
- CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.10.1 or higher)
- ADuCM302x DFP (3.2.0 or higher)
- ADICUP3029 BSP (1.1.0 or higher)
- Python 3
- GNU make (added in path) or the pre-compiled HEX file

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

- Connect the :adi:`EVAL-CN0569-PMDZ` to the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` via the P9
  connector. Use Pins 3 to 6 on the **CN0569** PMOD connector to connect to the
  top row of the P9 PMOD connector on the ADICUP3029 board. Pins 1 and 2 will
  remain unconnected towards the center of the motherboard. Your setup should
  look like in the picture below.

- Use a mother-to-father breadboard wire to connect Pin 1 from the CN0569 to
  Pin 5 on the ADICUP3029 P7 header. The connection should look like in the
  below picture. What this does is connecting the GPIO0 of the ADPD1080 to one
  of the interrupt GPIOs from the ADuCM3029. We will use this to calibrate the
  system clocks.

- Connect a micro-USB cable to P10 connector of the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` and
  connect it to a computer.

Building the Software
---------------------

After installing CrossCore Embedded Studio and necessary support pack the user
can open a command line terminal (with admin privileges on Windows) and
navigate to the project folder in the cloned no-OS repository. There the
following list of commands can be used:

::

   make

- This is the complete compilation process. It is made up of three rules, that
  can be used separately: project, update, build

::

   make project

- creates the ``build`` directory and the required directory structure

- uses SDK to create a project under the ``build`` directory

::

   make update

- updates the no-OS sources under the ``build`` directory with files
  specified in ``src.mk``

::

   make build

- performs the build of files under the ``build`` directory using gcc

::

   make sdkbuild

- performs the build of files under the ``build`` directory using SDK

When modifications are performed, the following three commands trigger the
necessary clean actions:

::

   make clean

- deletes the artifacts generated during build

::

   make reset

- deletes the ``build`` directory (this results in a fresh setup for
  starting the complete compilation process)

::

   make sdkclean

- cleans the artifacts (.o, .elf, .hex, etc.) created by the build command
  using the SDK

::

   make run

- downloads and runs the executable on the target board

::

   make debug

- downloads the executable on the target board and opens a command-line
  ``gdb`` instance to debug it (only on some platforms)

Running the Example
-------------------

After the controller has been programmed and the firmware is running on the
ADICUP3029 the IIO server is up and a connection to it can be established.
This can be done either by using :ref:`IIO Oscilloscope <iio-oscilloscope>` or
the :git-pyadi-iio:`pyadi-iio code <examples/cn0569>`.

To use the gesture sensor and theremin examples, the python library must be
installed first using pip:

::

   pip install pyadi-iio

After the installation is complete the example must be configured to connect to
the correct COM port. For the theremin example that means
:git-pyadi-iio:`changing line 97 accordingly <examples/cn0569>`, 
with the correct COM port number.

The example can then be run using:

::

   python cn0569_theremin_module.py

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the EVAL-ADICUP3029 with the software for
the CN0569.

- Dragging and dropping the HEX into the DAPLINK drive
- Building and debugging using CCES and the command line

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.
