ADXL355 Accelerometer PMOD Demo
===============================

The **ADuCM360_demo_adxl355_pmdz** is an accelerometer demo project for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with the EVAL-ADXL355-PMDZ board, using the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins in Eclipse environment.

General description
-------------------

This project is an example for how to use :doc:`EVAL-ADICUP360 board </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adicup360/hardware/base_board>` in combination with the :doc:`EVAL-ADXL355-PMDZ accelerometer PMOD board. </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adicup360/hardware/adxl355>`

The ADuCM360_demo_adxl355_pmdz project uses the :adi:`EVAL-ADXL355-PMDZ` which has the **ADXL355 3-axis MEMS accelerometer** on board.

The application reads the \*\* X \*\* , \*\* Y \*\*, and \*\* Z \*\* acceleration registers. The acceleration in the 3 axis is displayed in **[G]**. There is an internal temperature sensor in the ADXL355, which is converted by the on chip 12-bit ADC. The acceleration range can also be selected by setting the **ADXL355_RANGE** variable with the *ADXL355.h* file. (Values of [2, 4, and 8 are acceptable] )

All the outputs are printed from the UART to the USER USB port and can be read
on the PC using a serial terminal program, such as Putty or Tera Term.

For precision applications, each **ADXL355** chip requires individual calibration which can be done by measuring and setting the definitions // ACC_TEMP_BIAS// and // ACC_TEMP_SENSITIVITY// parameters in the *ADXL362.h* file.

The temperature in degrees celsius, can be derived from the ADC readings \*\*
Tadc \*\* using the predefined formula:

::

       Temp = (Tadc - ADXL355_TEMP_BIAS)/ ADXL355_TEMP_SLOPE) + 25;

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  EVAL-ADICUP360
   -  EVAL-ADXL355-PMDZ
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADuCM360_demo_adxl355_pmdz software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.7.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM36x DFP (1.0.2 or higher)
   -  CMSIS ARM Pack (4.3.0 or higher)
   -  Serial Terminal Program

      -  Such as Putty or Tera Term

Setting up the hardware
-----------------------

-   To program the base board, set the jumpers/switches as shown in the next
    figure. The important jumpers/switches are highlighted in red.

.. image:: ../images/cn0216_hw_config.png
   :width: 500

-  Plug the EVAL-ADXL355-PMDZ board in the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board, via the **PMOD_SPI** port (P4).
-  Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the **User USB**.(P13)

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the
ADXL355.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

Configuring the Software Parameters
-----------------------------------

-  **Temperature sensor calibration values**- *ADXL355_TEMP_BIAS* and *ADXL355_TEMP_SLOPE* paramaters - find your values based on the calculation formula (*ADXL355.h*):

::

   #define ADXL355_TEMP_BIAS           (float)1852.0
   #define ADXL355_TEMP_SLOPE          (float)-9.05

-  **Accelerometer range setting** - *ADXL_RANGE* parameter - 2, 4, or 8 are acceptable values to set the [g] range for the ADXL355 (*ADXL355.h*).

::

   #define ADXL_SENSE        2

-  \*\* Sensor activity and inactivity thresholds*\* - *ACT_VALUE* and *INACT_VALUE* paramaters used to determine at which acceleration values the sensor can react at sleep/wake-up commands (*ADXL355.h*):

::

   #define ACT_VALUE          50
   #define INACT_VALUE        50

-  \*\* Sensor activity and inactivity time*\* - *ACT_TIMER* and *INACT_TIMER* paramaters used to determine sleep/wake-up intervals(*ADXL355.h*):

::

   #define ACT_TIMER          50
   #define INACT_TIMER        50

Outputting Data
---------------

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In order to view the data, you must flash the program to the EVAL-ADICUP360.
-  Once complete you will need to switch the USB cable from the DEBUG USB (P14) to the USER USB (P13).
-  Then follow the UART settings below with the serial terminal program.

Following is the UART configuration.

In the **src** and **include** folders you will find the source and header files related to ADXL355 application. You can modify as you wanted those files. The *Communication.c/h* files contain SPI and UART specific data, meanwhile the *ADXL355.c/h* files contain the accelerometer data. Here are parameters you can configure:

The **RTE** folder contains device and system related files:

-  **Device Folder** – contains low levels drivers for ADuCM360 microcontroller.(try not to edit these files)
-  **system.rteconfig** - Allows the user to select the peripherial components they need, along with the startup and ARM cmsis files needed for the project.
