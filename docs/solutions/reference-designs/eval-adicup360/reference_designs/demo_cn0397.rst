Smart Visible Light Detection Demo
==================================

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0397** is a RGB light detection demo project for the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board with additional EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ shield, created using the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-ins in Eclipse environment.

General description
-------------------

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0397** project uses the :adi:`EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ shield <en/design-center/reference-designs/hardware-reference-design/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0397>` which is a single-supply, low power, low noise, 16-bit light detector utilizing wavelength specific photodiodes. The photodiodes used in this circuit are sensitive at different wavelengths, to read light intensity levels over the visible light spectrum where the plants are photosynthetically active.

The **EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ** board uses :adi:`ad8500`, a low power, precision CMOS op amp with a low input bias current of a typical 1pA which is used in a transipedance amplifier configuration to convert the current output of the photodiodes into voltage. It also features :adi:`ad7798` a 3-channel, low noise, low power 16-bit ADC that converts the analog voltage into digital data in for the processing of data into light intensity. The circuit utilizes RGB photodiodes from Everlight with their peak sensitivities 620nm (**R**), 550nm (**G**) and 470nm (**B**).

The **ADuCM360_demo_cn0397** application perform ADC readings for all 3 channels, processes them and make all necessary calculations in order to provide light intensity and light concentration for each color.

The 16-bits ADC data are received using **SPI interface** of the EVAL-ADICUP360 board. The **UART interface** (**115200** baud rate and **8-bits** data length) is used to send(and to receive) data to (from) a terminal window.

**Light intensity** [Lux] is calculated using ADC output value for selected channel and a constant value for each color:

::

   Light Intensity = CODE * Light intensity Constant

**Light Concentration** [%] is calculated based on the light intensity and optimal level for each color:

::

   Light concentration = Intensity\*100/Optimal Level

Beside **light intensity** and **light concentration** values, for each channel will be displayed a **colored bar** in [0%, 100%] format for light concentration representation. It will inform the user when the concentration for a specific channel will reach **100%**. Application offer the possibility to perform a system offset calibration for each **RGB channel**. All calculation are using data specific to each color of the used LEDs:

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  EVAL-ADICUP360
   -  EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADuCM360_demo_cn0397 software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.7.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM36x DFP (1.0.2 or higher)
   -  CMSIS ARM Pack (4.3.0 or higher)
   -  Serial Terminal Program

      -  Such as Putty or Tera Term

Setting up the hardware
-----------------------

-  To program the base board, set the jumpers/switches as shown in the next
   figure. The important jumpers/switches are highlighted in red.

   :align: center
   :width: 600

-  Connect the **EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ** to the Arduino connectors **P2, P5, P6, P7, P8** of the **EVAL-ADICUP360** board.
-  Configure the Chip select jumper (**P1**) on the EVAL-CN0397-ARDZ to the 1-2 position.
-  Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the
   Debug USB.(P14)

Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP360 with the software for the
CN0397.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Bin to the MBED drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

Configuring the Software Parameters
-----------------------------------

-  **Terminal refresh** - *DISPLAY_REFRESH* parameter - how often to refresh the output data - input time value in [msec] (*CN0391.h*).
-  **System offset calibration** - *USE_CALIBRATION* parameter - enable/disable system offset calibration on all 3 channels - *YES* -> enable calibration; *NO* -> disable calibration(*CN0398.h*).

Outputting Data
---------------

Serial Terminal Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In order to view the data, you must flash the program to the EVAL-ADICUP360.
-  Once complete you will need to switch the USB cable from the DEBUG USB (P14) to the USER USB (P13).
-  Then follow the UART settings below with the serial terminal program.

Following is the UART configuration.

::

     Select COM Port
     Baud rate: 115200
     Data: 8 bit
     Parity: none
     Stop: 1 bit
     Flow Control: none

Calibration procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **CN0397** needs to be calibrated first before using it in order to achieve best performance. A system zero offset calibration needs to be run to cancel the offset for all of the channels. This can be done by covering and not allowing any light to reach the photodiodes.

If the calibration routine is enabled (check *USE_CALIBRATION* parameter) in a terminal window will pop up messages asking the user to cover the photodiodes one of the time so the calibration can be performed. With the photodiodes covered press **<ENTER>** button on the key board and the next message will prompt to cover the next photodiodes.

Once all the channels have been calibrated, the circuit is now ready for use.
The output data will be available for each LED.
