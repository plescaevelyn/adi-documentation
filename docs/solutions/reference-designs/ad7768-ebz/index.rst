AD7768-EVB User Guide
=====================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD7768` is an 8-channel simultaneous sampling sigma-delta ADC with a
modulator and digital filter per channel, enabling synchronized sampling of AC
and DC signals.

The :adi:`AD7768` achieves 108 dB dynamic range at a maximum input bandwidth
of 110.8 kHz, combined with typical performance of +/- 2 ppm integral
nonlinearity (INL), +/- 50 uV offset error, and +/- 30 ppm gain error.

The AD7768 user can trade off input bandwidth, output data rate, and power
dissipation, and select one of three power modes to optimize for noise targets
and power consumption. The flexibility of the AD7768 allows it to become a
reusable platform for low power DC and high performance AC measurement modules.

The AD7768 has three power modes:

- Fast mode: 256 kSPS maximum, 110.8 kHz input bandwidth, 51.5 mW per channel
- Median mode: 128 kSPS maximum, 55.4 kHz input bandwidth, 27.5 mW per
  channel
- Low power mode: 32 kSPS maximum, 13.8 kHz input bandwidth, 9.375 mW per
  channel

The AD7768 offers extensive digital filtering capabilities, such as a wideband,
low +/- 0.005 dB pass-band ripple, antialiasing low-pass filter with sharp
roll-off, and 105 dB attenuation at the Nyquist frequency.

Frequency domain measurements can use the wideband linear phase filter. This
filter has a flat pass band (+/- 0.005 dB ripple) from DC to 102.4 kHz at
256 kSPS, from DC to 51.2 kHz at 128 kSPS, or from DC to 12.8 kHz at
32 kSPS.

The AD7768 also offers sinc response via a sinc5 filter, a low latency path
for low bandwidth, and low noise measurements. The wideband and sinc5 filters
can be selected and run on a per channel basis.

Within these filter options, the user can improve the dynamic range by
selecting from decimation rates of x32, x64, x128, x256, x512, and x1024.

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

The HDL architecture comprises a serial data path that enables all the ADC
channels and a parallel data path, so that the user can enable only the
desired channels.

The reference design uses the :git-hdl:`AXI AD7768 IP core <library/axi_ad7768>`
to interface the AD7768 ADC. Data is deserialized according to the number of
active lanes. The interface module also implements a parallel CRC check
algorithm. The data from the interface module is processed by the ADC channel
module.

The top module instantiates the AD7768 interface module, the ADC channel
register map, the ADC common register map, and the AXI handling interface. The
ADC common register map allows basic monitoring and control of the ADC, while
the ADC channel register map enables per-channel monitoring and control.

HDL Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :git-hdl:`projects/ad7768evb`

Building the HDL Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The design is built upon ADI's generic HDL reference design framework. ADI
does not distribute pre-built bitstream files, so the project must be built
from source. Clone the HDL repository and, with the correct tools installed,
navigate to the project directory and run ``make``:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd hdl/projects/ad7768evb/zed
   make

Linux Device Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD7768 Linux driver is an IIO (Industrial I/O) subsystem driver targeting
the AD7768 and AD7768-4 precision ADCs.

- :git-linux:`drivers/iio/adc/ad7768.c`

Linux Device Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Required device tree properties:

- ``compatible``: Must be one of ``"adi,ad7768"`` or ``"adi,ad7768-4"``
- ``reg``: SPI chip select number for the device
- ``clocks``: phandle to master clock of the device
- ``clock-names``: Must be ``"mclk"``
- ``dmas``: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node
- ``dma-names``: Must be ``"rx"``
- ``vref-supply``: phandle to the regulator for ADC reference voltage

Optional properties:

- ``reset-gpios``: Reset GPIO
- ``adi,data-lines``: Number of DOUTx pins channels data is output on
  (default: 1). This value is determined by the configuration of the AD7768
  FORMATx pins, which are read on power-up.
