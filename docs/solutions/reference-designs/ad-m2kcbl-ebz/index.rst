Each wire is colored differently for easier identification of the
corresponding pin. The 10 pin socket and 10 wires is connected to the
analog section of M2K. First 2 pairs of cables form two general-purpose
differential analog input channels used by the analog signal acquisition
tools (such as oscilloscope, Spectrum analyzer, network analyzer and
voltmeter). Third pair of cables are corresponding to ground. Next pair
corresponds to the user supplies. The red wire corresponds to the
positive supply while the white one corresponds to the negative
supply.The last pair of wires in this cable are two general-purpose
Single-ended analog outputs. The 20 pins socket with 20 wires is
connected to the digital section of the M2k. First pair of pins consists
of 2 ground pins. Second pair are two digital triggers. With grey is the
trigger in and grey with a white stripe is the trigger out. (These are
used in tools Oscilloscope and Logic analyzer tools.) Rest of the pins
are X 16 digital input or output pins.
