EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ
=================

Capacitance-to-Digital Converter.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ <CN0552>` is a
`PMOD <https://reference.digilentinc.com/pmod/start>`__ form-factor evaluation
board for the :adi:`AD7746`, a high resolution, sigma-delta capacitance-to-digital
converter (CDC). The architecture features inherent high resolution (24-bit no
missing codes, up to 21-bit effective resolution), high linearity (±0.01%),
and high accuracy (±4 fF factory calibrated).

   EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ

The :adi:`CN0552 Circuit Note <CN0552>` has two capacitive inputs with each
channel configurable as single-ended or differential. The capacitance input
range is ±4.096 pF at a maximum bulk capacitance of 17 pF but is capable of
extending up to ±50 pF with a maximum bulk capacitance of 200 pF which can be
balanced by a programmable on-chip, digital-to-capacitance converter (CAPDAC).

Device Driver Support
---------------------

There are two device driver solutions provided for controlling the
EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ:

#. **EVAL-ADICUP3029** -- The ADICUP3029 example application uses the AD7746
   no-OS driver and emulates the Linux IIO framework through the tinyiiod
   daemon library. The application communicates with the host computer via the
   serial backend, over a USB-UART physical connection. This facilitates rapid
   application development on a host computer, independent from embedded code
   development.

#. **Raspberry Pi** -- The Linux driver uses the Industrial Input/Output (IIO)
   framework, greatly simplifying the development of application code via the
   cross-platform libiio library, which is written in C and includes bindings
   for Python, MATLAB, C#, and other languages. Application code can run
   directly on the platform board, communicating with the device over the local
   backend, or from a remote host over the network or USB backends.

Similarly, utility software such as iio_info, IIO Oscilloscope, and PyADI-IIO
can be used for both the EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ on Raspberry Pi and on ADICUP3029.

General Setup Using ADICUP3029
-------------------------------

The EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ can be used with the EVAL-ADICUP3029.

Demo Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Hardware:**

- :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029 <EVAL-ADICUP3029>`
- :adi:`EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ <CN0552>`
- Two 2 pF ceramic capacitors
- Micro-USB to USB cable
- PC or laptop with USB port

**Software:**

There are two ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the CN0552:

#. Dragging and dropping the .hex file to the DAPLINK drive
#. Building, compiling, and debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software will be a version that Analog
Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the easiest way to
get started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore allows you to change parameters and
customize the software to fit your needs, but will be more advanced and will
require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

The software for the ADICUP3029_CN0552 demo can be found here:

- Prebuilt CN0552 Hex File:
  :git-no-OS:`ADuCM3029_demo_cn0552.hex <releases/download/last_commit/cn0552.zip>`
- Complete CN0552 Source Files:
  :git-no-OS:`ADuCM3029_demo_cn0552 Source Code <projects/cn0552>`

To build the project from the source, follow the instructions in the
`no-OS wiki <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS/wiki>`__.

Setting up the Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Connect the EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ board at connector **P9** of the
   EVAL-ADICUP3029.
#. Connect a micro-USB cable to the P10 connector of the EVAL-ADICUP3029
   and connect it to a computer. The final setup should look similar to the
   picture below.

      :width: 400px
      :align: center

      Switch Configuration

#. From your PC, open My Computer and look for the DAPLINK drive. If you see
   this then the drivers are complete and correct.

   .. figure:: daplink.jpg
      :width: 300px
      :align: center

      DAPLINK Drive

#. Simply extract the provided zip file. Once extracted, you will see the
   pre-built hex file for the CN0552 demo. Then drag and drop this hex file to
   the DAPLINK drive and your ADICUP3029 board will be programmed. The DS2
   (red) LED will blink rapidly.
#. The DS2 will stop blinking and will stay ON once the programming is done.
#. For demo purposes, place a 2 pF capacitor between the EXCA pin and the
   CIN1(+) pin on the PMOD board. This will be your first channel. Then, place
   another 2 pF capacitor between EXCB pin and the CIN2(+) pin on the PMOD
   board. This will be your second channel.

      Overall Setup (Raspberry Pi)

Software (ADICUP3029 and Raspberry Pi)
---------------------------------------

Connection
^^^^^^^^^^

To connect your device, the software must create a context. The context
creation depends on the backend used and the platform where the
EVAL-CN0552-PMDZ is attached. Two platforms are currently supported: Raspberry
Pi using ADI Kuiper Linux and the ADICUP3029 running the no-OS AD7746 demo
project. The user needs to supply a URI which will be used in the context
creation.

The libiio library is used for interfacing with IIO devices. Install the
`libiio package <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/releases>`__ on
your machine.

The ``iio_info`` command is part of the libiio package and reports all IIO
attributes. Upon installation, enter the command on the terminal to access it.

**For Raspberry Pi direct local access:**

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_info

**For Windows machine connected to Raspberry Pi:**

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_info -u ip:<ip address of your rpi>

**For Windows machine connected to ADICUP3029:**

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_info -u serial:<serial port>

.. note::

   - For Raspberry Pi: The Windows machine and the Raspberry Pi board should
     be connected to the same network.
   - For ADICUP3029 on Windows: Check the port via Device Manager in the
     Ports (COM & LPT) section (e.g., ``iio_info -u serial:COM4``).
   - For ADICUP3029 on Linux: Check the ``/dev/`` directory for the device
     (e.g., ``iio_info -u serial:/dev/ttyUSB0``).

IIO Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``iio_attr`` command reads and writes IIO attributes:

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_attr [OPTION]...

To look at the context attributes:

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_attr -a -C

The ``iio_reg`` command reads or writes SPI or I2C registers in an IIO device.
This is generally not needed for end applications, but can be useful in
debugging drivers. Note that you need to specify a context using the ``-u``
qualifier when not directly accessing the device via Raspberry Pi or when using
the ADICUP3029 platform.

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_reg -u <context> <device> <register> [<value>]

To read the device ID (register 0x02) of an AD7746 interfaced via Raspberry Pi
from a Windows machine:

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_reg -u ip:<ip address> ad7746 0x02

IIO Oscilloscope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure to download/update to the latest version of
`IIO Oscilloscope <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope/releases>`__.

#. Once done with the installation or update, open the application. Supply a
   URI for context creation (see the Connection section above).
#. Press refresh to display available IIO devices. Once ``ad7746`` appears,
   press connect.

PyADI-IIO
^^^^^^^^^^

PyADI-IIO is a Python abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO drivers to
make them easier to use. This module provides device-specific APIs built on top
of the current libiio Python bindings. These interfaces try to match the driver
naming as much as possible without the need to understand the complexities of
libiio and IIO.

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing and configuring PyADI-IIO on your machine, you are ready to
run Python script examples. Run the ``ad7746.py`` found in the examples folder.
