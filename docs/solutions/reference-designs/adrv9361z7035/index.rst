The :adi:`ADRV9361-Z7035` is built on a portfolio of highly integrated System-On-Module (SOMs) based on the Xilinx Zynq®-7000 All Programmable (AP)SoC. Starting with the AD9361, it is schematically & HDL similar to the `ad-fmcomms3-ebz <https://wiki.analog.com/ad-fmcomms3-ebz>`_.

The purpose of the :adi:`ADRV9361-Z7035` RF SOM is to provide an RF platform to software developers, system architects, product developers, etc, who want a single platform operating over a wide tuning range (70 MHz – 6 GHz) that is capable of being used for prototype, evaluation and reference design to help with production volume.
