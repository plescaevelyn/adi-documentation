EVAL-LTC4306-PMDZ User Guide
=============================

Introduction

The :adi:`EVAL-LTC4306` features the :adi:`LTC4306`, a 4-channel, 2-wire I2C
bus and SMBus-compatible multiplexer with bus buffers that provide capacitive
isolation between the upstream bus and downstream buses.

This evaluation board provides 6-pin PMOD connectors for upstream and downstream
connection for compatibility with PMOD form factors such as the
:adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029`, an Arduino-based wireless development platform for
Internet of Things applications based on an ultralow power ARM Cortex-M3
processor.

The :adi:`EVAL-LTC4306` comes with PMOD connectors and 10 k\ |ohm| pull-up
resistors on both the upstream and downstream side, and a 0.1 |mu|\ F bypass
capacitor on the upstream side. The user also has the option to add a 6-pin,
2.54 mm pitch pin header for connection to the GPIO pins for added
functionality. Test points can be added at various locations on the board for
fault monitoring, and additional bypass capacitors (0805 size footprint) can be
placed on the upstream and downstream side for adequate bypassing on power
supply lines.

Supported Devices
-----------------

- :adi:`LTC4306`

Special Features
----------------

- **4 selectable downstream buses**: Nested addressing possible when used as a
  mux.
- **Disconnect from stuck bus**: Allows the master to resume connection if one
  of the downstream buses is stuck low.
- **2-wire bus buffers**: Breaks up the upstream and downstream side into two
  buses; also breaks up the capacitance.
- **Buffer supply independence**: Level shifting is possible; 2-wire buses can
  be pulled up to supply voltages ranging from 2.7 V to 5.5 V, independent of
  the :adi:`LTC4306` VCC voltage.
- **Slew-limited rise time accelerators**: Help reduce rise time, allowing the
  use of longer cables with less reflection and larger bus pull-up resistors for
  better noise margin.
- **2-wire bus hot swap**: Prevents 2-wire bus corruption during live insertion
  and removal from a backplane.
- **Fault reporting**: Helps the master find and resolve system faults
  efficiently. ALERT pins on upstream and downstream buses.
- **Mass write address**: One command to all :adi:`LTC4306` devices can be
  issued at the same time using the special address (1011101).
- **27 distinct I2C addresses**: Via 3 address pins (ADR0, ADR1, ADR2).

General Operation
-----------------

   EVAL-LTC4306-PMDZ setup

Connect the master/host controller's SDA and SCL pins to the :adi:`LTC4306`'s
SDAIN and SCLIN pins (upstream bus pins) via the P1 PMOD connector. VCCIN
(supply voltage of the :adi:`LTC4306`) can be anywhere from 2.7 V to 5.5 V.

The host controller on the upstream side first addresses and configures the
:adi:`LTC4306` via I2C commands by writing to register 3 (see page 9 of the
datasheet) to connect the upstream bus to one or more of the four downstream
buses. Once communication is established, a master on the upstream 2-wire bus
(SDAIN, SCLIN) can connect to any combination of downstream buses through the
:adi:`LTC4306`'s bus buffers and multiplexers/switches. The same device address
can be used on multiple downstream buses.

Each downstream bus can be powered separately using its own VCC pin
(VCC1--VCC4 on the schematic) on the P5--P11 connectors. This allows the
:adi:`LTC4306` to be used as a level shifter.

To power all downstream buses from the :adi:`LTC4306`'s supply voltage, insert
jumpers JP1 and JP2 in both A and B positions:

- JP1 position A connects the upstream voltage to the first downstream bus
  (SCL1, SDA1).
- JP1 position B connects the upstream voltage to the second downstream bus
  (SCL2, SDA2).

The ENABLE pin, when pulled low, resets the :adi:`LTC4306` to its default
register state and disables communication. Communication is re-established when
ENABLE is released high. By default, it is pulled up to VCCIN by a 10 k\ |ohm|
resistor. The 2nd pin of the P1 PMOD connector can be used to drive ENABLE low.

When the upstream bus is connected to one or more downstream buses, the READY
pin voltage is pulled high to VCC. When the upstream bus is disconnected from
all downstream buses, the READY voltage is low and the red RDY LED lights up.

The default jumper setting for ADR0, ADR1, and ADR2 connects all address pins
to VCCIN, setting the :adi:`LTC4306` address to **0xAA**. To set a different
address, configure the jumpers according to Table 1 of the datasheet on page 13
(left position = L, middle position = NC, right position = H; disconnect = NC
for all 3 jumpers).

.. important::

   - Do not activate rise time accelerators on buses whose pull-up supply
     voltages are lower than VCC.
   - Ensure logic low voltages forced on all clock and data pins are < 0.4 V.
   - When activating multiple downstream buses powered from separate supplies,
     the :adi:`LTC4306`'s VCC voltage must be less than or equal to the lowest
     downstream bus pull-up supply voltage.
   - Power supply voltages must not exceed 5.5 V.

Getting Started
---------------

To evaluate the performance of the :adi:`LTC4306`:

#. Power up the upstream side of the board and the :adi:`LTC4306` via the P1.6
   pin. Connect P1.5 to GND and P1.4 and P1.3 to SDA and SCL of the host
   controller respectively. If the host controller is available in a PMOD form
   factor, plug the P1 PMOD connector into the six pin PMOD host connector.
#. Power up the downstream buses 1--4 using separate power supplies or from the
   upstream side. To power all buses from the upstream voltage supply, place both
   jumpers JP1 and JP2 in A and B positions.
#. Configure jumpers JP6--JP8 to set the desired I2C address for the
   :adi:`LTC4306` according to Table 1 on page 13 of the datasheet. By default,
   the address 0xAA is selected.
#. Connect the SCLx and SDAx of the desired downstream bus to the SCL and SDA
   pins of the peripheral/slave device.
#. To close all FET switches and enable communication to all downstream buses,
   send an SMBus write command to set bits 4, 5, 6, and 7 of register 3 to 1.
#. Any slave on downstream buses 1--4 can now be addressed seamlessly, with
   data transparently transmitted from the controller to the peripheral devices.
#. To experiment with more features of the :adi:`LTC4306`, use the SMBus Read
   Byte and Write Byte protocols in conjunction with the register definitions
   on pages 8 and 9 of the datasheet.

No-OS Driver
-------------

The :git-no-OS:`LTC4306 no-OS driver <main:drivers/io-expander/ltc4306>`
provides support for the :adi:`LTC4306` I2C/SMBus multiplexer. The driver
handles device initialization, address generation, channel configuration,
GPIO control, and fault status readout.

No-OS Project
--------------

The :git-no-OS:`eval-ltc4306 project <main:projects/eval-ltc4306>` provides
a basic example that demonstrates the :adi:`LTC4306` multiplexer functionality.

Build Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

For instructions on building the no-OS project, refer to the
:dokuwiki:`No-OS Build Guide <resources/no-os/build>`.

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic example initializes the :adi:`LTC4306` driver and a MAX5380 DAC
driver for the downstream devices. It performs the following sequence:

#. Generates the I2C address based on the ADR0/ADR1/ADR2 pin settings (default
   0xAA with all pins tied to VCCIN).
#. Configures GPIO1 and GPIO2 as outputs and blinks the green GPIO LEDs 16
   times.
#. Iterates through each downstream channel, selecting it, writing a DAC
   voltage, then deselecting it. This produces a staircase waveform on each
   channel, offset from the others.

Source code:
:git-no-OS:`projects/eval-ltc4306/src/examples/basic <main:projects/eval-ltc4306/src/examples/basic>`.

Hardware Output Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To verify the hardware output when using the example code:

#. Connect the :adi:`EVAL-LTC4306` to the microcontroller board following the
   required connections described above.
#. Connect the :adi:`MAX9611PMB1` peripherals to the corresponding channels
   (check the ``LTC4306_NUM_DOWNSTREAM`` variable in ``basic_example.c``).
#. Build and load the example .hex file to the microcontroller board.
#. Reset or reconnect the microcontroller board.
#. Observe the :adi:`EVAL-LTC4306`'s green GPIO LEDs blink (default: 16 times).
#. Connect each :adi:`MAX9611PMB1` output to an oscilloscope channel.
#. For proper operation, a sawtooth wave offset from each other should be seen
   (e.g., 500 mV offset between Ch1 and Ch2).

The example project runs sequentially and continuously repeats until power is
removed.

Linux Driver
-------------

The :adi:`LTC4306` is supported by a mainlined Linux I2C mux driver. When
loaded, the driver registers the :adi:`LTC4306` as an I2C multiplexer, allowing
downstream I2C buses to be accessed transparently through the standard Linux
I2C subsystem.
