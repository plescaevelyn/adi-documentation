AD-FMCADC3-EBZ
===============

The :adi:`AD-FMCADC3-EBZ <EVAL-AD-FMCADC3-EBZ>` is a high speed data
acquisition board featuring the :adi:`AD9625` single channel ADC at
2500 MSPS and the :adi:`ADA4961` Low Distortion, 3.2 GHz, RF Digital Gain
Amplifier driving the converter. The FMC form factor supports the JESD204B
high speed serial interface.

This board is targeted to use the ADI reference designs that work with Xilinx
development systems.

Contains
--------

The card contains:

- :adi:`AD9625` 12-bit ADC with sampling speeds of up to 2500 MSPS, with a
  JESD204B digital interface.
- :adi:`ADA4961` Low Distortion, 3.2 GHz, RF Digital Gain Amplifier.
- :adi:`ADP7104` 20 V, 500 mA, low noise, CMOS LDO
- :adi:`ADP1753` low dropout linear regulator, 1.6 V to 3.6 V input, up to
  800 mA output current
- :adi:`ADP2119` 2 A, 1.2 MHz, synchronous step-down DC-to-DC regulator
- :adi:`ADP1741` 2 A, low Vin, low dropout, CMOS linear regulator
- :adi:`ADR280` ultralow power high PSRR voltage reference

Note for Revision A
--------------------

The revision A board has the amplifier gain control via SPI. When powering up
the FMCADC3 board, the gain of the amplifier will default to an attenuated
state. When applying a signal source to the FMCADC3 at the analog input
connector J201, use a low jitter, low noise signal source with a level at
-20 dBm. Apply a signal source no greater than -8 dBm when achieving
full-scale of the converter and maximum gain of the amplifier is applied.

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

The reference design includes the device data capture via the JESD204B serial
interface and the SPI interface. The samples are written to the external
DDR-DRAM. It allows programming the device and monitoring its internal
registers via SPI.

The AD-FMCADC3-EBZ shares common HDL with the
:ref:`AD-FMCADC2-EBZ <ad-fmcadc2-ebz>`.

Quick Start
-----------

The AD-FMCADC3-EBZ connects to the HPC connector of the carrier board.
The carrier setup requires power, UART (115200), Ethernet, and JTAG
connections. A typical setup with the ZC706 carrier is shown below.

#. Connect the AD-FMCADC3-EBZ to the HPC FMC connector on the carrier board.
#. Connect the power supply to the carrier board.
#. Connect a UART cable between the carrier and the host PC (115200 baud, 8N1).
#. Connect an Ethernet cable to the carrier board (for Linux).
#. Optionally connect HDMI (if available) or JTAG (for no-OS).
#. Connect the desired signal source to the "Ain" SMA connector.
#. Power on the carrier board.

Specifications
--------------

The AD-FMCADC3-EBZ board's primary purpose is to quickly and easily connect to
an FMC carrier platform and start collecting data using the AD9625. The board
is designed to be easy to use. Out of the box the board will self power and
self clock when connected to an FMC carrier. The only other required equipment
is your chosen signal source to provide an input signal to "Ain".

This rapid prototyping board also has 4 vertically mounted SMA connectors.
These are labeled SYSREF IN and SYSREF OUT. These are to enable
synchronization of multiple AD-FMCADC3-EBZ boards together using
characteristics of the JESD204B high speed serial interface between the AD9625
and FPGA.

Clocking
~~~~~~~~

The AD-FMCADC3-EBZ provides multiple options for clocking the AD9625. The
default configuration of the board clocks the ADC using an on-board 2.5 GHz,
low noise, crystal oscillator from Crystek. This oscillator is then routed
through a wide band transformer producing the differential clock for the ADC.

Alternatively, the oscillator can be disconnected and an external clock source
connected by only changing two components on the board. A single ended clock
connected to the CLK+ input would then be routed through the transformer in
the same way.

Finally, the option exists to connect a differential clock to the board using
both the CLK+ and CLK- inputs. Then referencing the schematic, make the
component changes to directly route the differential input bypassing the
transformer.

Front End
~~~~~~~~~

The AD-FMCADC3-EBZ uses a passive front end designed for very wide bandwidth.
A single ended input needs to be provided to "Ain". A 1:2 impedance ratio
broadband balun then converts the input signal differentially to the ADA4961
inputs and has a 1.6 GHz bandwidth at -3 dB.
