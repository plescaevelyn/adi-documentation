CN0506 User Guide
==================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`CN0506` Dual PHY Ethernet evaluation board features two :adi:`ADIN1300`
robust, industrial, low power 10/100/1000Base-T Ethernet PHY devices. The
board is designed to interface the MAC and PHY through RGMII, MII, or RMII
interfaces.

The circuit consists of two individual, independent 10/100/1000 Mbps PHYs,
each with an energy efficient Ethernet (EEE) physical layer device (PHY) core
with all associated common analog circuitry, input and output clock buffering,
management interface, subsystem registers, MAC interface, and control logic.

On the RJ45 LAN socket, the status and speed LEDs are controlled from the FPGA.
Each LED is bi-color (green or yellow). The right LED indicates activity/status,
and the left LED indicates speed: off = 10 Mbit, yellow = 100 Mbit, green =
1 Gbit.

FMC Connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FMC connector connects to the LPC connector of the carrier board.

RJ45 Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RJ45 connectors M1 (Channel A) and M2 (Channel B) have built-in magnetics
that help reduce the size of the board. Each connector is dedicated to a PHY
interface (:adi:`ADIN1300`), allowing each channel to operate independently.

Configuration Resistors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MAC Interface Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MAC interface selection pins are shared with the RX_CTL/RX_DV/CRS_DV and
RXC/RX_CLK pins, which have weak internal pull-down resistors and are
configured in RGMII mode with 2 ns delay by default. The MAC interface can be
selected via software, or hardware-configured at power-up using the resistors
listed below.

SD Card Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest `ADI Kuiper Linux <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`__
   image and flash it to the SD card.

2. In the BOOT partition of the flashed image, copy the appropriate kernel
   file (``uImage`` from the ``zynq-common`` folder) to the root of the BOOT
   partition.

3. Copy the boot files from the desired interface configuration folder
   (e.g., ``zynq-zed-adv7511-cn0506-mii`` or ``zynq-zed-adv7511-cn0506-rgmii``)
   to the root of the BOOT partition.

4. Safely eject the SD card and insert it into the ZC706 SD Card Interface
   Connector (J30).

5. Power on the ZC706 by toggling SW1. The board should boot from the SD card.

6. Open a UART terminal (115200 baud, 8N1) on the host PC to monitor the
   boot process and interact with the Linux console.

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

Build Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default MAC-to-PHY interface is RGMII. To build a specific interface
configuration, set the ``INTF_CFG`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

   make INTF_CFG=MII
   make INTF_CFG=RMII
   make INTF_CFG=RGMII

Management Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A synchronous serial data interface similar to I2C is made from MDC and MDIO
(bidirectional) signals.

MII Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MII interface supports data rates of 100 Mbps and 10 Mbps.

.. figure:: cn0506_mii.png
   :align: center

   CN0506 MII interface block diagram

The PHY sends a free-running clock as the receive clock (RX_CLK). The transmit
clock is also a free-running clock generated by the PHY. Based on the link
speed, the frequency of the Rx/Tx clock is 25 MHz for 100 Mbit/s and 2.5 MHz
for 10 Mbit/s.

Typically the PS/HPS MAC only exposes a GMII interface, but the required MII
signals can be obtained since MII is a subset of GMII. The GMII interface
contains extra signals: GTXCLK (125 MHz clock for gigabit TX) and an additional
4 MSBs for both RXD and TXD data buses.

The reset signal for both ADIN1300 devices comes from the PS/HPS. An optional
``link_st`` signal indicates if a valid link is established, connected to
GPIO[35] for PHY A and GPIO[34] for PHY B. The speed LEDs are hard-coded to
yellow (100 Mbit).

RMII Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RMII interface supports data rates of 100 Mbps and 10 Mbps with a reduced
number of signals compared to MII.

.. figure:: cn0506_rmii.png
   :align: center

   CN0506 RMII interface block diagram

The reference clock operates at 50 MHz in both 100 Mbit/s and 10 Mbit/s mode.
Software is used to configure the programmable clock oscillators on the board to
50 MHz via I2C. In this design both the MAC (MII to RMII converter) and PHY
work on the same 50 MHz clock.

Software should not be used to set the ADIN1300 in RMII mode; instead, this is
done by setting MAC_IF_SEL1 (CRS_DV) and MAC_IF_SEL0 both to high using
internal pull-up resistors in the FPGA.

Because the REF_CLOCK is configured by software independently for each PHY, an
independent reset signal is required for the initialization of each PHY. The
main reset signal comes from the PS/HPS reset generator. Software can
independently reset PHY A by setting GPIO[37] high and PHY B by setting
GPIO[36] high (controlled by the PS/HPS). The speed LEDs are hard-coded to
yellow (100 Mbit).

RGMII Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RGMII interface supports data rates of 1 Gbps, 100 Mbps, and 10 Mbps.
It consists of only 12 pins, compared to GMII's 24.

.. figure:: cn0506_rgmii.png
   :align: center

   CN0506 RGMII interface block diagram

Source synchronous interfaces are used for both RX and TX. The ADIN1300
generates a 125 MHz, 25 MHz, or 2.5 MHz RXC signal to synchronize the RXD
pins. The transmit clock signal is provided by the MAC on the TXC line.

The reset signal for both ADIN1300 devices comes from the PS/HPS.
The INT_N signal is not used as an interrupt; it is only monitored by software
as input on GPIO[33] (PHY A) and GPIO[32] (PHY B).

The speed LEDs are fully functional for the RGMII interface. For Xilinx
carriers, the GMII to RGMII converters use shared clock resources, but this
does not affect the independence of the two interfaces.
