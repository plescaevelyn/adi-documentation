EVAL-CN0506-FMCZ Hardware User Guide
====================================

The :adi:`CN0506` shown in Figure 1 is a dual channel, low latency, low power Ethernet Phy card supporting speeds of 10/100/1000 Mbps for Industrial Ethernet applications.

The circuit consists of two indivudual, independent 10/100/1000Mb PHYs, each
with an energy efficient Ethernet (EEE) physical layer device (PHY) core with
all associated common analog circuitry, input and output clock buffering,
management interface, subsystem registers, MAC interface and control logic.

Connectors and Jumper Configurations
------------------------------------

.. image:: images/image_1.png

FMC Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FMC connector connects to the LPC connector of the carrier board.

RJ45 Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RJ45 connectors M1 for Channel A and M2 for Channel B has built in magnetics
that help reduce the size of the the board. Each are dedicated to a phy
interface ADIN1300 allowing each channel to be independent.

Configuration Resistors
-----------------------

Mac Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pins for the selecting the MAC interface is shared with the RX_CTL/RX_DV/
CRS_DV pin and RXC/RX_CLK pin which has weak internal pull-down resistors and is
configure to RGMII mode with 2ns delay. The ADIN1300 has The MAC interface
selection be done via software but can be hardware configured upon the power up
of the device using the table below.

+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| **MAC Interface Selection** | **MACIF_SEL1(Phy A/Phy B)** | **MACIF_SEL0(Phy A/Phy B)** |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| RGMII RXC/TXC 2ns delay     | R12/R78                     | R9/R75                      |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| RGMII RXC/TXC 2ns delay     | R11/R77                     | R9/R75                      |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| MII                         | R17/R78                     | R8/R74                      |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| RMII                        | R11/R77                     | R8/R74                      |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+

Configuration Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These configuration modes are used to set the configurations for Auto MDIX and
Phy Speed Configurations for both Phy channels A and B

======== ======== ========
**Mode** **R_LO** **R_HI**
MODE_1   10k      Open
Mode_2   10k      56k
Mode_3   56k      10k
Mode_4   Open     10k
======== ======== ========

Phy Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The board has both of the channels configured for 10 Half Duplex/Full Duplex,
100 Half Duplex/Full Duplex and 1000 Full Duplex slave mode upon power up.

Auto MDIX
~~~~~~~~~

======================= =============
**Configuration**       **MDIX_MODE**
Manual MDI              MODE_1
Manual MDIX             MODE_2
Auto MDIX - Prefer MDIX MODE_3
Auto MDIX - Prefer MDI  MODE_4
======================= =============

LED Indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These LED's indicate when a link is established and is blinking when there is
activity. LED on Phy channel A is labelled DS4 and the LED on Phy channel B is
labelled DS2.
