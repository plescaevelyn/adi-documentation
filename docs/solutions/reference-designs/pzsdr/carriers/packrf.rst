ADRV-PackRF
===========

PackRF is a pair of software defined radios designed using the `ADRV9361-Z7035 <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv936x_rfsom>`_ system on module (SOM). The SOM is based on the\ :adi:`AD9361 <en/products/rf-microwave/integrated-transceivers-transmitters-receivers/wideband-transceivers-ic/ad9361.html>` RF Transceiver and the Xilinx Zynq®-7000 All Programmable (AP) SoC.

See the :adi:`Analog Devices Product Home Page <en/design-center/reference-designs/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0412.html#rd-overview>` for information on price and options to purchase the system.

The purpose of the radio is to provide an RF platform to software developers, system architects, and product developers who want a single platform which operates over a wide tuning range (70 MHz – 6 GHz). PackRF accelerates development from initial evaluation to field deployment.

The radio is contained inside a blue aluminum enclosure with access to
connections for power, ethernet, USB, OLED, audio and micro SD card. Antenna’s
connect to SMA’s on the second face plate (not shown here) for TX, RX,
monitoring and GPS I/O’s. Silkscreen on the radio contains various part numbers
and links to additional material.

Portable Radio Reference Design
-------------------------------

The radios are referred to as 'Portable Radio Reference Design'. Each one is a combination of `ADRV9361-Z7035 <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/adrv936x_rfsom>`_ PCB, carrier card, metal enclosure and additional, smaller items (adapter PCBs, cables, connectors etc). The system is fully contained inside of a 159.99mm x 78.00mm x 43.00mm (6.3" x 3.071" x 1.69") aluminum metal enclosure. Card guides on the inside of the case provide a secure shelf for the PCB's. Production units will be a blue metal etched with silkscreen providing part numbers, links to documentation and more.

Included with the radio module is a complete single carrier modem reference
design. The modem is designed as a constantly transmitting frequency division
duplexing (FDD) system with a single transmit channel (uplink) and single
receive channel (downlink), enabling a single bidirectional point-to-point link
between two nodes. A complete wireless video link can be demonstrated with the
webcams provided in this kit between disjoint nodes.

Portable Radio Software and HDL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The software for the ADRV-PACKRF is provided by Analog Devices as an open source reference design that can be used in various applications. The system source code consists of several components, which are used together to control onboard devices and provide connectivity to external tools for development. Follow this link for more information on the :doc:`System Software Architecture </solutions/reference-designs/pzsdr/carriers/packrf/system-software-architecture>`

Radio Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save yourself a headache and do not disassemble the radio.

Assembly of the Portable Radio Reference Design is almost as complicated as some of the hardware and software. It occupies a significant amount of time and will cause headaches, finger aches and potential damage to the device. A detailed list of instructions is provided in case you are assembling or opening a radio. Have a look at the :doc:`assembly instructions </solutions/reference-designs/pzsdr/carriers/portable-radio-reference-design/assembly-instructions>` before beginning.

The Gallery
~~~~~~~~~~~

There is also a :doc:`picture gallery </solutions/reference-designs/pzsdr/carriers/portable-radio-reference-design/gallery>` to document the travels and adventures of the radio.
