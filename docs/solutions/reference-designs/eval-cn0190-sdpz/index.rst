EVAL-CN0190-SDPZ
=================

Multivoltage Power System Reference Design.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0190 <CN0190>` is a reference solution for multivoltage power systems.
The design can easily be adapted to customer requirements and provides the most
popular system voltages. The circuit uses an optimum combination of switching
and linear regulators to provide an overall efficiency of approximately 78%
when the outputs are fully loaded. Output power delivered under full load is
approximately 25 W.

The circuit supplies most of the typical power rails required for digital and
analog circuits and also demonstrates an easy way to realize overvoltage,
undervoltage, and overcurrent detection and protection. In addition, this
module shows how to implement sequencing and power margining control.

The circuit is flexible and can accept a wide input voltage range from 6 V to
14 V. This is possible because the highly efficient switching controllers and
regulators used in the first stage of each power rail have correspondingly wide
input ranges. The :adi:`ADM1178` block provides overvoltage and overcurrent
detection and protection for the input supply, as well as hot-swap control for
the whole system. The :adi:`ADM1066` offers a single-chip solution for power
supply monitoring and sequencing control for all of the 12 power rails and also
margining control for the 3.3 V (2 A) rail.

Test Setup
----------

Power Rails Efficiency Measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test setup for power rails efficiency measurements uses the following
configuration:

.. figure:: block.png
   :align: center

   Test setup functional block diagram for power rails efficiency measurements

.. admonition:: Efficiency Formula

   Efficiency = P\ :sub:`OUT` / P\ :sub:`IN` = (V\ :sub:`OUT` x
   I\ :sub:`OUT`) / (V\ :sub:`IN` x I\ :sub:`IN`)

   - P\ :sub:`OUT` can be calculated by multiplying V\ :sub:`OUT` by
     I\ :sub:`OUT`.
   - V\ :sub:`IN` and I\ :sub:`IN` can be read directly from the display
     window of the Agilent E3631A DC power supply.
   - Electronic load should be set to constant current mode.

Ripple and Transient Response Measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: block2.png
   :align: center

   Test setup functional block diagram for ripple and transient response
   measurements

For ripple and transient response measurements:

- Channel A of the oscilloscope monitors the output voltage of the module.
- Channel B monitors the voltage across the 0.1 Ohm current sense resistor,
  which is proportional to the load current.
- Electronic load should be set to "switch" mode with preset amplitude and
  frequency.

I2C Programming Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The I2C serial interface is on Connector 15:

- Pin 1: SCLK
- Pin 2: SDA
- Pin 3: GND

Software and Driver Installation
---------------------------------

You can design your own control strategy and download it into the ADM1066
through the I2C bus connector (JP1) using the ADM1066 Super Sequencer
evaluation board software.

To create a custom sequencing solution and program the ADM1066, perform the
following steps:

1. Download the USB-SDP-CABLEZ driver.
2. Install the *Super Sequencer Software*.
3. Install *Graphviz*.
4. Install the *prog106x Setup Application Software*.
5. Connect the USB-SDP-CABLEZ to the PC, and the other end to the
   EVAL-CN0190-EB1Z.
6. Download the custom .hex file to the EVAL-CN0190-EB1Z using the Windows
   command prompt.

.. note::

   The ADM1066 comes **pre-programmed out of the box** where all power outputs
   are active at the same time. You do not need to program the board unless you
   want to create your own custom power sequencing/monitoring solution.

Using Super Sequencer Software
-------------------------------

Super Sequencer evaluation software enables the user to create a new control
strategy and generate a new Intel hex file for the ADM1066. To generate a new
hex file:

1. Open ``SuperSequencerSoftwareEval.exe`` installed on the PC.

   .. figure:: sequencer_icon.png
      :align: center

      SuperSequencer software icon

2. Assuming all new configurations and controls have been set in the software,
   go to **File** and click **Save Settings to File**.

   .. figure:: savesettings.png
      :align: center

      Save Settings to File menu option

3. Select **Create Intel Hex File** and click **Save**.

   .. figure:: hexfile.png
      :align: center

      Create Intel Hex File dialog

4. Once saving is completed, the new hex file is ready to be downloaded to the
   ADM1066.

Downloading Firmware for ADM1066
---------------------------------

1. Copy the EEPROM hex file (e.g., ``ADM1066_SuperSequencing_REVB.hex``) to the
   root directory on Disk C: (e.g., ``C:\ADM1066_SuperSequencing_REVB.hex``).

2. Plug the USB-to-I2C converter dongle into the USB port on the PC. Plug the
   other end of the cable into JP1 on the right side of the EVAL-CN0190-EB1Z.

   .. figure:: usbtosdp.png

      the USB-SDP-CABLEZ:

      - SCL to SCL
      - SDA to SDA
      - GND to GND

3. Turn on the power supply to the EVAL-CN0190-EB1Z.

4. Open the Command Prompt (``C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe``).

   and press Enter.

   .. note::

      The hex file name may differ depending on the user's custom
      configuration.

6. The on-chip EEPROM of ADM1066 is successfully programmed if the screen
   displays the following output after several seconds.
