EVAL-CN0150-SDPZ
=================

RF Power Measurement Circuit (1 MHz to 8 GHz).

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0150 <CN0150>` is a circuit that measures RF power at any frequency
from 1 MHz to 8 GHz over a range of approximately 60 dB. The measurement
result is provided as a digital code at the output of a 12-bit ADC with serial
interface and integrated reference. The output of the RF detector has a
glueless interface to the ADC and uses most of the ADC's input range without
further adjustment. A simple two-point system calibration is performed in the
digital domain.

The :adi:`AD8318` is a demodulating logarithmic amplifier, capable of
accurately converting an RF input signal to a corresponding decibel-scaled
output voltage. It employs the progressive compression technique over a
cascaded amplifier chain, each stage of which is equipped with a detector cell.
It maintains accurate log conformance for signals of 1 MHz to 6 GHz and
provides useful operation to 8 GHz. The input range is typically 60 dB
(re: 50 ohm) with error less than +/-1 dB and provides a typical output
voltage temperature stability of +/-0.5 dB.

The :adi:`AD7887` is a high speed, low power, 12-bit ADC that operates from a
single 2.7 V to 5.25 V power supply. It is capable of 125 kSPS throughput rate.
The output coding is straight binary, and the part is capable of converting
full power signals of up to 2.5 MHz. The ADC can be configured for either dual
or single channel operation via the on-chip control register. There is a
default single-channel mode that allows the AD7887 to be operated as a
read-only ADC, simplifying the control logic.

The EVAL-CN0150-SDPZ board connects to ADI's System Demonstration Platform
(SDP) and is powered by a +6 V supply or +6 V wall wart.

Test Setup
~~~~~~~~~~

   :width: 600px

   EVAL-CN0150-SDPZ Test Setup

#. Connect the 120-pin connector on the :adi:`EVAL-CN0150A-SDPZ` to the
   connector marked "CON A" on the :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CB1Z`.
#. Connect the RF signal source to the EVAL-CN0150A-SDPZ via the SMA RF input
   connector.
#. With power to the supply off, connect a +6 V power supply to the pins
   marked "+6V" and "GND" on the board. Alternatively, a +6 V wall wart can
   be connected to the barrel connector.
#. Connect the USB cable supplied with the SDP board to the USB port on the PC.
#. Apply power to the +6 V supply (or wall wart).
#. Launch the evaluation software.
#. Connect the USB cable from the PC to the USB mini connector on the SDP
   board.

.. important::

   Do **not** connect the USB cable to the Mini-USB connector on the SDP board
   before turning on the dc power supply for the EVAL-CN0150-SDPZ.

Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the slope and intercept of the system vary from device to device, a
system level calibration is **required**.

#. Apply two known signal levels PIN_1 and PIN_2 close to the endpoints of the
   AD8318 linear input range. Note that they should be well within the linear
   operating range of the device (**-50 dBm to -10 dBm for this device**).

      Calibration Input Range

#. Measure the corresponding output codes CODE_1 and CODE_2 from the ADC.
#. Calculate the calibration coefficients using the following equations:

   - **SLOPE_ADC** = (CODE_2 - CODE_1) / (PIN_2 - PIN_1)
   - **INTERCEPT** = PIN_2 - (CODE_2 / SLOPE_ADC)

#. These are used to calculate the unknown input power level, PIN, when
   operating in the field:

   - **PIN** = (CODE_OUT / SLOPE_ADC) + INTERCEPT

Installing the Evaluation Software
-----------------------------------

#. Extract the file **CN0150_Evaluation_Software.zip** and open **setup.exe**.

   .. note::

      It is recommended to install the CN0150 Evaluation Software to the
