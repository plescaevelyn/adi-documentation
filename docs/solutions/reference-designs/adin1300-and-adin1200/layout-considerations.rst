ADIN1300 and ADIN1200 Layout Considerations
===========================================

The ADIN1300 and ADIN1200 need specific layout guidelines and hardware
considerations for designing a physical layer device. This user guide will cover
details on the ADIN1300 and ADIN1200 layout recommendations. The sections within
this user guide provide a high-level overview, and the document must be used in
conjunction with the ADIN1200/1200 datasheets and additional apps notes found
through the ADIN1200 and ADIN1300 product pages.

Layout Considerations
---------------------

This section is an overview of the key areas of interest during placement and
layout of the PHY and corresponding support components. Take care when routing
high speed interface signals to maximize signal performance and ensure optimum
EMC performance, with a view to ensure critical signal traces are kept as short
as possible to minimize noise coupling.

PHY Package Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LFCSP has an exposed pad underneath the package that must be soldered to the
PCB ground for mechanical and thermal reasons. For thermal impedance performance
and to maximize heat removal, use of a 4 × 4 array of thermal vias beneath the
exposed ground pad is recommended.

There are also two bus bars on either side of the exposed pad, these bus bars
are connected to internal voltage rails and are not intended or required to be
soldered to the board. The PCB land pattern must incorporate the exposed ground
paddle with vias and two keep out areas around the bus bars in the footprint. No
PCB traces or vias can be used in either of the keep out areas. The
EVAL-ADIN1300FMCZ uses an array of 4 × 4 vias on a 0.75 mm grid arrangement, as
shown below. The via pad diameter dimension is 0.02 in. (0.5015 mm) and the
finished drill hole diameter is 0.01 in. (0.2489 mm).

Component Placement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prioritization of the critical traces and components helps simplify the routing
exercise. Place and orient the critical traces and components first to ensure an
effective layout with minimal turns, vias, and crossing traces. For an Ethernet
PHY layout, the important components are the crystal and load capacitors, the
transformer on the MDI lines, and all bypass capacitors local to the device.
Prioritize these components and the routing to them. Keep the PHY chip at least
1 in. away from the edge of the board. The following sections provide more
detail for each of the areas.

MDI Lines
~~~~~~~~~

The MDI interface runs from the ADIN1300 PHY to the transformer, and from there
to the RJ45 connector. Traces running from the MDI_x_x pins of the ADIN1300 to
the magnetics must be on the same side of the board, kept as short as possible
(ideally less than 1 inch in length), but more importantly they should be length
matched, for the MDI traces, the intra differential pairs these should be length
matched within 20 mils for 1G operation and within 50 mils for 100M or 10M
operation. The inter differential pairs are not as critical and should be length
matched as close as possible, but within 1000 mils. The individual trace
impedance of these tracks kept below 50 Ω, with differential impedance of 100 Ω
for each pair. The same recommendations apply for traces running from the
magnetics to the RJ45 connector. Keep impedances constant throughout because any
discontinuities may affect signal integrity.

Each pair must be routed together, trace widths kept the same throughout, trace
lengths kept equal where possible, and avoid any right angles on these traces
(use curves in traces or 45° angles). Avoid stubs on all signal traces. Where
possible, route traces on the same layer. By taking these guidelines into
account the difference in latency between each pair is minimized and this will
also help in avoiding an increase in common mode noise.

Route traces over a continuous reference plane with no interruptions to reduce
inductance.

Where possible, ensure a solid return path underneath all signal traces. Avoid
routing signal traces across plane splits.

MAC Interface Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All signals within TX group should be length matched, similarly for all signals
within RX group. Where possible route these interface pins on the same side as
component pins. Keep trace lengths as short as possible. Route traces with an
impedance of 50 Ω to ground.

The ADIN1300 has the capability to program the drive current of the RGMII pins
to help improve signal integrity and minimize ringing. Alternatively, series
termination resistors can be placed in all RGMII output pins if further tuning
is required.

Crystal Oscillator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure minimum current consumption and to minimize stray capacitances, make
connections between the crystal, capacitors, and ground as close to the ADIN1300
as possible and preferably on the same side as the ADIN1300 device. Caps should
be tuned to adjust for pin capacitance and trace capacitance.

Power and Ground Planes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a PCB layout point of view, it is important to place the decoupling
capacitors as close as possible to the power and GND pins to minimize the
inductance.

Magnetics Module Grounding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A split ground plane under the transformer minimizes noise coupling across the
transformer and between adjacent coils within. Ensure a physical separation of
the ground planes underneath the transformer. Make the width of this separation
at least 100 mil.

Transformer Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No metal layers can be directly underneath the transformer to minimize any noise
coupling across the transformer.

RJ45 Module Grounding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For optimal EMC performance, it is recommended to use a metal shielded RJ45
connector with the shield connected to chassis ground. There must be an
isolation gap between the chassis ground and the PHY IC ground with consistent
isolation across all layers.

Placement of TVS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to place the TVS diode close to the ADIN1300 device to ensure
minimal track inductance between the external protection and internal protection
within the device.

Thermal Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADIN1300 is packaged in an LFCSP package. This package is designed with an
exposed paddle which must be soldered to the PCB for mechanical and thermal
reasons. The exposed paddle acts to conduct heat away from the package and into
the PCB. By incorporating an array of thermal vias in the PCB thermal paddle,
heat is dissipated more effectively into the inner metal layers of the PCB. When
designing the PCB layout for optimum thermal performance, use a 4 mm × 4 mm
array of vias under the paddle. This LFCSP device includes two exposed power
bars adjacent to the exposed pad at the top and bottom. These bars are connected
to internal power rails and the area around them is a keep out zone. Keep these
areas clear of traces or vias.
