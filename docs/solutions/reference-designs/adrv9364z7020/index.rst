The :adi:`ADRV9364-Z7020 <ADRV9364>` is built on a portfolio of highly
integrated System-On-Module (SOMs) based on the Xilinx Zynq®-7000 All
Programmable (AP)SoC. Built on the AD9364, it is schematically & HDL similar to
the :dokuwiki:`AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ <resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms4-ebz>`.

The purpose of the SDR is to provide an RF platform to software developers,
system architects, product developers, etc, who want a single platform which
operates over a wide tuning range (70 MHz – 6 GHz) that is capable of being
used for prototyping, evaluation, and as a reference design to help with
production volume.
