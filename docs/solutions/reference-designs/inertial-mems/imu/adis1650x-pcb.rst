ADIS1650x-x/PCBZ BREAKOUT BOARD WIKI GUIDE
==========================================

OVERVIEW
========

There are seven (7) breakout boards that support ADIS1650x IMU products. These
breakout boards that provide a simple way to develop a prototype connection
between the ADIS1650x IMUs and an existing embedded processor platform. This
breakout board already contains the ADIS1650x IMU and one 16-pin header, which
mates to 2 mm ribbon cables. As a general guideline, these breakout boards will
support reliable communications over ribbon cables that are up to 20 cm in
length, but it is always a good idea to validate signal integrity before relying
on this type of connection to support a critical communication link.

The primary attributes that differentiate each of these models are measurement
range (gyroscopes and accelerometers) and the calibration temperature range.

EVAL-ADIS2 CONNECTION
=====================

The J1 connector on each ADIS1650x-x/PCBZ breakout board is pin-for-pin compatible with the same connector (J1) on the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS2` evaluation system. The picture below shows the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS2` connectors.

.. image:: ../images/adis2_connectordescription_pic.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

If connecting an external power supply, refer to the picture below for the
polarity of the J3 external power connector:

.. image:: ../images/adis2_powerconnector.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

The user should follow these steps when connecting the xxx to the :adi:`EVAL-ADIS2` evaluation system:

1. Ensure that Jumper JP1 is straddling the left “+3.3V REG” pin and the center
   pin, assuming the EVAL-ADIS2 board is oriented with the Mini-USB connector is
   on the left-hand side.

Note: If the user wishes to use an external power supply, move the JP1 jumper so
that it straddles the center and lower pin and connect the external supply to
Connector J3. GND is the left pin and VDD (+3.3 V) is the right pin.

2. Connect the ribbon cable between the EVAL-ADIS2 and ADIS1650x-x evaluation
   board.

3. Install the SDP Drivers from :adi:`EVAL-ADIS2 USB Drivers <media/en/evaluation-boards-kits/evaluation-software/SDPDrivers.zip>`.

3. Install the ADIS-EVAL2 Evaluation software from :adi:`EVAL-ADIS2 Evaluation Software <media/en/evaluation-boards-kits/evaluation-software/IMU_Evaluation.zip>`

4. Connect the EVAL-ADIS2 USB cable to the PC and verify that LED1 and LED2 are
   illuminated on the EVAL-ADIS2 board.

DIMENSTIONS/MOUNTING HOLES
==========================

These breakout boards have four mounting holes (one in each corner) which
support attachment to another surface with M2 machine screws. Please see the
following diagram for more details:

CABLING
=======

Cable Assembly

TIP: Use "2.00 mm IDC Ribbon Cable Assembly" as search criteria to find the
latest options on the market.

At the time of initial release for these breakout boards, we were most familiar with the `TCSD Series from Samtec <https://www.samtec.com/products/tcsd>`_.
