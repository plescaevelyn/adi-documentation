ADI MEMS IMUs Glossary: Performance Characteristics, Measurement Setups and Applications
========================================================================================

This page is intended to introduce and discuss common characteristics of MEMS
IMUs, how to measure those performance metrics and finally some applications
where those metrics matter.

Bias Repeatability
==================

Measured in °/hour.

Bias Error
==========

Offset error in MEMs output on a particular axis. Fixed error typically.
Measured in °/hour.

Sensitivity Error
=================

An error in the gain of the response. Non-uniformity that affects measurement
output.

Allan Variance (AVAR)
=====================

A plot of noise versus averaging time.

In-run Bias Stability (IRBS)
============================

This can be thought of as the sensor resolution in an "ideal case." It is also
found as the minimum of the AVAR plot.

Angle Random Walk (ARW)
=======================

Measured in °/hour/√Hz or °/√hour.

Applies to gyroscopes. It is the "close-in" (small τ) on the AVAR curve and is
noise that comes from the quantization process. Taken at Τ = 1 second. In order
to calculate the ARW, take the value of the square-root of the AllanVariance and
divide by 60 [iMAR].

For an example consider the ADIS16153, with datasheet here: :adi:`media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADIS16135.pdf#Page=08`. The graph of the AllanVariance is this:

Rate Random Walk (ARRW)
=======================

Applies to gyroscopes and is the "far out" (large Τ) on the Allan Variance
(AVAR) curve. This quantity represents long-term stability of the sensor
measurement.

Velocity Random Walk (VRW)
==========================

Similar to the angular random walk (ARW) for gyroscopes. Noise from quantization
of the axes.

Noise Density
=============

Similar to amplifier noise density. RMS noise per unit of BW. Can be
approximated with the formula: ND ≅ ARW/60\* √2

Vibration Rectification Error (VRE)
===================================

Measured in degrees/sec/g².

Cross-Axis Sensitivity
======================

Unintended effect where rotation/acceleration from one axis is detected on
another axis. Can be calculated from axis to axis misalignment error for
accels/gyros: sin(axis to axis misalignment) in %

Example: For the ADIS16448, the accel axis to axis misalignment is 0.2 degrees.
Therefore Cross-axis sensitivity accel is sin(0.2) = 0.197%. Gyro is sin(0.05) =
0.09%. Magnetometer: sin(0.25) = 0.247%

Linear Acceleration Effect (Linear-g), Linear Acceleration Effect on Bias, Linear-g Rejection (Linear-g Sensitivity)
====================================================================================================================

Unintended effect where linear acceleration is detected as rotation. Measured in
degrees/sec/g.

Vibration Rejection (Gyros)
===========================

A combination of Linear-g and Vibration Rectification (VRE) specs.

Vibration response of a gyro = Linear-g X-Axis Acceleration + (VRE X-Axis
Acceleration)^2
