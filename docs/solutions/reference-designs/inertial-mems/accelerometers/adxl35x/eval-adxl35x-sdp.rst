SOFTWARE STARTUP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the software first starts, it will check which interface board is being
used. If the software is not able to detect any system it will show the
following window below. Make sure that the device is connected properly and
there are no loose connections. If the board is not detected, you might need to
close the GUI application and open it again,

.. image:: ../../images/1.png

   :width: 300

**Figure 8**

When the software detects a device, it will ask the user to specify which
interface board is being used. The image below shows SDP Interface Rev.4 being
detected. The user can also look at the SDP Interface version identifier to
determine which revision board you have.

GETTING STARTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADXL357 Customer Evaluation System provide an easy start evaluating the
sensor performance. The graphic user interface is divided into separate tabs,
each of which specializes in commonly performed measurements for accelerometer
devices. In this way, the evaluation system offers users an immediate ability to
capture data for a wide variety of tests without the need to develop a
customized hardware and software solution.

A brief description of the functionality contained within the evaluation
environment is presented in Table 2.

**Table 1:** Evaluation Environment Overview.

SHARED COMMANDS BETWEEN TABS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic configuration block below (yellow rectangle) is shared by all tabs,
except for a fewer exceptions that vary from tab to tab. Details will be
provided on each tab. Each section of the basic configuration block is explained
next:

**1. Power Mode**

|image3|

**Figure 11:** Standby to Measurement Mode.

**2. Output Data Rate**

|image4|

**Figure 12:** Output Data Rate.

The image below shows how different ODR affects how the data is being sampled.
Data being sampled at 3.096 Hz is seen to be rougher (zig-zag motion) as the
sample rate is slower than the rate at which data is being received which may
cause loss of some data. Whereas data being sampled at 500Hz is seen to be a lot
faster and smooth.

.. image:: ../../images/picture10.png
   :align: center

**Figure 13:** Output Data Rate Example.

**3. High Pass Filter**

Below are the available, user selectable high pass filter values.

|image5|

**Figure 14:** High Pass Filter.

**4. Range**

3 user selectable range available. See example image below, for the ADXL357
evaluation system.

**Figure 15:** Range Options.

**5. Offset Trim**

**Figure 16:** Offset Trim.

**6. Saving File Path**

|image8|

**Figure 17**

**7. Memory Register Map**

Click the Read Register Map button for a snapshot of the current memory register
values (see Figure 18).

|image9|

**Figure 18: ADXL35x Register Map**

**8. Start/Stop Capture and Quit**

These commands are also shared by all tabs. Start Capture initiates the data
collection on the current tab. After Start Capture is pressed, it is
automatically grayed out and disabled until Stop Capture is pressed. Quit exits
the GUI.

DEVICE OVERVIEW TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../images/picture3.png
   :align: center

**Figure 19:** Device Overview Tab.

The Device Overview tab is a good way to become familiar with how the device
operates. This tab contains all the controls to configure the part. For example,
when the part first turns on, it powers up in standby mode. The ADXL35x powers
up in standby mode to minimize power consumption. To exit standby mode, look at
the Power Settings control. Change the mode from standby to measurement mode
(see Figure. 11).

ACTIVITY/INACTIVITY DETECTION TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The activity tab allows you set threshold for activity detection. In the example
below the activity box is checked for x-axis and it shows ACT_EN register is
enabled for X-axis. The next setting is for activity threshold, which allows the
user to set the max threshold for it to start measuring acceleration. For this
example, the Activity threshold is set to 3g, if there’s any activity more than
3g, the measurement starts for X-axis. Activity counter sets the number of
consecutive events needed above the set threshold to detect activity.

**Figure 22:** Activity Detection for all axes.

FFT
~~~

This tab runs a continuous loop that captures 1024 samples at the selected ODR
and plots the FFT. The FFT is configured for 4 samples RMS averaging and
rectangular windowing. The figure below shows the FFT plot for a 1g peak, 200Hz
sinewave excitation.

   :align: center

**Figure 23:** FFT Tab.

SELF-TEST TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADXL35X incorporates a self-test feature that effectively tests its
mechanical and electronic systems simultaneously. When the self-test function is
enabled, an electrostatic force is exerted on the mechanical sensor. This
electrostatic force moves the mechanical sensing element in the same manner as
acceleration, and it is additive to the acceleration experienced by the device.
This added electrostatic force results in an output change in the x-, y-, and
z-axes.

.. image:: ../../images/picture22.png
   :align: center

**Figure 24:** Self-test event.

The Self-Test tab demonstrates how this function operates for each axis. Once
the Start Data Acquisition button is clicked, the software acquires one second
of data from the ADXL35X at the user specified data rate.

-  For the first 109 samples, the self-test feature is disabled (default state).
-  At 109th sample the self-test bit is asserted, and the self-test function begins. An electrostatic force is applied to the beam. This causes the output to shift as shown in Figure 25.
-  The self-test bit is asserted for the next sample.
-  At 210th sample the self-test bit is de-asserted and the device output return
   to normal.

TILT MEASUREMENT TAB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab enables the user to quicky evaluate the performance of the ADXL35x
sensor as an inclinometer. To obtain accurate results, the software allows a
pre-calibration step by leveraging the acceleration of gravity. Click the
Calibrate XL button to begin. Following this, a series of 6 pop-up dialog boxes
will appear. Follow the instructions in these dialog boxes. They will instruct
you to hold the evaluation board in specific orientations such that each axis is
exposed to a ±1g field (see Figure 26).

.. image:: ../../images/picture17.png
   :align: center

**Figure 26:** Tilt Measurement Tab.

Use the circular marking on the top right corner of Eval board as the reference
point for calibration.

|image11|

**Figure 27**

Place the x-axis in a +1g field. Hold the evaluation board vertically on a flat
surface as shown in Figure 27.Hold part for 1 second and click OK

|image12|

**Figure 28:** +1g calibration.

Reorient the part as shown in the next dialog box. Repeat until all 6
measurements have been completed. The offset and sensitivity calibration
coefficient are then calculated for each axis in g’s (see Figure 29).
