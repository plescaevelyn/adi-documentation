EVAL-CN0349-PMDZ
=================

Conductivity and Temperature Measurement System with Isolation.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0349` provides a robust and complete solution for processing
conductivity and temperature inputs into digital code. The design solution is
optimized for high precision and low cost measurement, using five active
devices, and has a total error less than 1% FSR after calibration. The output
of the circuit is fully isolated, and therefore ground-loop interference is
effectively reduced, making it ideal for industrial applications.

The circuit incorporates the :adi:`AD5934` 12-bit impedance converter,
:adi:`ADG715` octal SPST switch, :adi:`AD8606` rail-to-rail op-amp,
:adi:`ADuM5000` isolated DC-DC converter, and :adi:`ADuM1250` dual I2C
isolator to convert the conductivity and temperature inputs to digital code.

The circuit has an 8-pin Digilent Pmod I2C interface connector on board, which
can be used for connection to a microprocessor or FPGA.

The :adi:`CN0349` circuit note discusses the design steps needed to optimize
the circuit for a specific measuring range including accuracy analysis and
component selection considerations.

The CN0349 board accepts both +3.3 V +/-10% or +5 V +/-10% power supplies.
The minimum current requirement is 300 mA.

.. important::

   The power supply for the CN0349 must provide the required current with
   minimum voltage drop. Please make sure the host has the same I/O level
   standard as the CN0349 board. Otherwise, permanent damage to the CN0349
   may occur.

Using the Evaluation Software
------------------------------

Establishing a USB Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Follow the instructions to properly install the software and connect the
   hardware as described in the previous sections.
#. Open the file named **CN0349.exe** in the installation directory or the
   shortcut in the Start menu.
#. The software should connect to the board automatically. If the hardware is
   not recognized by the PC, the Hardware Select window will appear, indicating
   that the software is waiting for a proper hardware connection. After
   connecting the hardware, the list in the window will populate. Choose the
   connected hardware and click **Select**.

Software Recommendations
-------------------------

.. warning::

   There are several important restrictions that must be addressed when
   developing custom application code using the EVAL-CN0349-PMDZ. If you do
   not follow these requirements, your results will likely be incorrect or
   erroneous.

When developing custom application code with the EVAL-CN0349-PMDZ, the
following requirements must be adhered to:

Digital Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The I2C communication protocol must be designed carefully. The maximum I2C
speed and timing is limited by the :adi:`ADG715` and the :adi:`AD5934`. The
maximum I2C clock speed for both parts is 400 kHz. The host I2C timing and
speed must meet the requirements of both the ADG715 and AD5934.

.. note::

   On the EVAL-CN0349-PMDZ evaluation board, the ADG715 I2C address is set to
   **0x48**, and the AD5934 I2C address is **0x0D**. Make sure the host I2C bus
   has no devices that share these addresses.

Input Signal Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`AD5934` excitation voltage and PGA must use the following settings:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Part
     - I2C Address
     - Register Address
     - Register Data
     - Description
   * - AD5934
     - 0x0D
     - 0x80
     - 0x01
     - Excitation Voltage 2.0 Vp-p, Internal PGA=1

System Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`ADG715` controls the conductivity calibration. At least one of the
following calibration settings must be used. Two calibration points per range
is recommended:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - I2C Data
     - Function
     - Description
   * - 0x09
     - High Range Cal 1
     - Rfb=R9=100 ohm, Rcal=R3=100 ohm
   * - 0x11
     - High Range Cal 2
     - Rfb=R9=100 ohm, Rcal=R4=1 kohm
   * - 0x12
     - Low Range Cal 1
     - Rfb=R8=1 kohm, Rcal=R4=1 kohm
   * - 0x22
     - Low Range Cal 2
     - Rfb=R8=1 kohm, Rcal=R7=10 kohm

.. important::

   The hardware limitations in the CN0349 board need to be considered carefully
   when writing the software. If other settings for AD5934 and ADG715 outside
   the limits described above are used, the AD5934 ADC input must not be
   saturated. The AD5934 ADC reference is AVDD2=3.3 V which determines the
   input range.

Measurement Ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Range
     - Conductivity Value
   * - Low Range
     - 1 uS to 1 mS
   * - High Range
     - 1 mS to 1 S

.. note::

   The board must be calibrated before measurement. Calibration theory and
   calculations are described in the :adi:`CN0349` circuit note.
