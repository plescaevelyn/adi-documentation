AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ Zynq ZC706 Quick Start Guide
==============================================

This guide provides some quick instructions (still takes awhile to download, and
set things up) on how to setup the AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ on:

- :xilinx:`ZC706 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc706-g.html>` (rev 1.1 or higher)

Requirements
------------

- You need a Host PC (Windows or Linux).
- You need a SD card writer connected to above PC (Supported USB SD
  readers/writers are OK).
- USB to UART cable
- [Optional] USB keyboard/mouse for the Zynq Device
- [Optional] HDMI Display (monitor or TV FULL HD only)

Creating / Configuring the SD Card
-----------------------------------

Setting up the hardware (ZC706)
-------------------------------

You will need to:

1. Get the :xilinx:`ZC706 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc706-g.html>`:

   1. Insert the SD-CARD into the SD Card Interface Connector (J30)
   2. Plug the AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ into the HPC Connector
   3. Plug your HDMI display device into the HDMI Video Connector (P1)
   4. Plug your USB mouse/keyboard into the USB 2.0 ULPI Controller,
      w/Micro-B Connector (J49)
   5. Plug the Power Supply into 12V Power input connector (J22) (DO NOT
      turn the device on).
   6. Set the jumpers: The main one is: SW11 - Big Blue Switch in the
      middle, which controls the Boot Mode, it needs to be set: 1: Down,
      2: Down, 3: Up, 4: Up, 5: Down. Other Jumpers can be checked via
      looking at the picture. (click the picture to make it bigger)
   7. Turn it on.
   8. Wait ~30 seconds for the "DONE" LED to turn green. This is above
      the power switch.
   9. Wait another ~30 seconds for the HDMI display device to start
      showing signs of life.

Alternatively, you can connect to board using USB-to-UART cable (using for
example ``TeraTerm``). Check network IP (for example by running ``ifconfig``
command), run ``enable_dummy_display.sh`` and then you can also connect by VNC
without using a monitor.

After booting process is complete, you can open IIO-Oscilloscope. Learn more
about it from the
:doc:`IIO Oscilloscope page </software/iio-oscilloscope/index>`.
You can interact with the IIO-Osc GUI either directly or over the network.

Even though this is Linux, this is a persistent file system. Care should be
taken not to corrupt the file system -- please shut down things, don't just turn
off the power switch. You can shut down the board from terminal as well with

``sudo shutdown -h now`` or ``sudo poweroff``
