AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ Arria10 SoC Development Kit Quick Start Guide
==============================================================

Requirements
------------

- :adi:`AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ`

  - 2x SMA cable for analog signal loopback (optional, but recommended)

- :intel:`Arria10 SoC Development Kit
  <content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/arria/10.html>`
  (Rev. C or later)

  - Power-supply
  - USB mini cable for serial console (optional, but recommended)
  - Ethernet cable for network connectivity (optional, but recommended)

- SD card with latest ADI Linux image

Creating / Configuring the SD Card

boards) </linux/kuiper/index>`.

Hardware Setup
--------------

FMC Pin Connection Configuration Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be compatible with the AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ the Arria10 SoC Development Kit
requires a minor rework.

In the default configuration of the Arria10 SoC Development Kit some of the FMC
header pins are connected to a dedicated clock chip. To be compatible with the
AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ these pins need to be connected directly to the FPGA.

The connection of those pins can be changed by moving the position of four zero
Ohm resistors:

- R612 to R610
- R613 to R611
- R621 to R620
- R633 to R632

These resistors can be found on the backside of the Arria10 SoC Development Kit
underneath the FMC A connector (J29). The following picture shows the required
configuration to be compatible with the AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ.

   Required resistor rework for AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ compatibility

Connections
-----------

- Insert the AD-FMCDA2-EBZ board into the FMC A (J29) header of the Arria10 SoC
  Development Kit
- Both the HPS (J26) and FPGA (J27) memory module must be installed on the
  Arria10 SoC Development Kit.
- For network connectivity connect a Ethernet cable to the right most Ethernet
  port (J5).
- For the serial console connect a USB cable to UART1 (J10).
- Insert the microSD card into the microSD card slot.

All jumpers and switches on the Arria10 SoC Development Kit should be in the
:intel:`default position
<content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683735/current/boot-select.html>`
configuring the board for SD card boot.

Booting the System
------------------

After turning on the power switch the following messages should appear on the
serial console.

.. collapsible:: Complete kernel boot log

   ::

Once the boot process has completed you'll be greeted with command prompt. As a
quick check if the AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ was correctly recognized run the ``iio_info``
command and filter for the registered devices.

.. code-block:: console

   root@analog:~# iio_info | grep iio:device
   iio:device0: ad9523-1
   iio:device1: axi-ad9680-hpc (buffer capable)
   iio:device2: axi-ad9144-hpc (buffer capable)

If the Arria 10 SoC Development Kit is connected to a network with a DHCP server
the IP address assigned to the board appears on the LCD. Alternatively you can
query the IP address by running ``ifconfig eth0`` on the command line. To
manually assign an IP address run ``ifconfig eth0 <IP_ADDR>``.
