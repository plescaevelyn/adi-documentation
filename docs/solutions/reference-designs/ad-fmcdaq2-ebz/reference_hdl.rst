AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ HDL Reference Design
=====================================

For the latest HDL reference design source code and documentation, please refer
to the :git-hdl:`DAQ2 HDL project <projects/daq2>`.

Functional Overview
-------------------

The reference design is a processor based (ARM or Microblaze/Nios2) embedded
system. A functional block diagram of the system is given below for both Xilinx
and Altera FPGAs. The device interfaces are shared by the same set of
transceivers followed by the individual JESD204B and ADC/DAC pcores. The cores
are programmable through an AXI-lite interface. The data path consists of
independent DMA interfaces for the transmit and receive paths.

Digital Interface
-----------------

The digital interface consists of 4 transmit and 4 receive lanes running at
10Gbps (default). The transceivers then interfaces to the cores at
128bits@250MHz. The data is sent or received based on the configuration
(programmable) from separate transmit and receive chains.

Altera specific
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Qsys, implementing JESD204B protocol requires several IPs. AVL_XCVR
is a wrapper which instantiates all the required IPs and configures them
according to the desired data rate. One AVL_XCVR must be instantiated for the
transmit path and one for the receive path. It adds clock bridges, PLL and
reconfiguration IP, proper reset, lane PLL for the transmit path, a JESD204B IP
instantiating the JESD204B base and a JESD204B IP for each lane instantiating
the PHY.

AXI_XCVR allows resetting and monitoring the transceiver path.

One important aspect for AD-FMCDAQ2-EBZ is that the reference clock needed for
the FPGA transceiver calibration is generated only after the AD9523-1 clock
generator is configured. The programming is done only after the FPGA is
configured and software is running. Because of this, the software needs to
perform a transceiver re-calibration after the transceiver reference clock is
stable and before taking AXI_XCVR cores out of reset.

DAC Interface
-------------

The DAC data may be sourced from an internal data generator (DDS, pattern or
PRBS) or from the external DDR via DMA. The internal DDS phase and frequency are
programmable.

ADC Interface
-------------

The ADC data is sent to the DDR via DMA. The core also supports PN monitoring at
the sample level. This is different from the JESD204B specific PN sequence
(though they both claim to be from the same equation).

Control and SPI
---------------

The device control and monitor signals are interfaced to a GPIO module. The SPI
signals are controlled by a separate AXI based SPI core.

Supported Carriers
------------------

These are the supported carriers for the HDL - not the complete package
(software and HDL). Typically the software lags behind the HDL, so if you don't
see the these listed on the main project page - it is not yet done.

Our recommended platforms are the Zynq based systems:

- :xilinx:`ZC706 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc706-g.html>`

but it also works on the following fabric only systems:

- :xilinx:`KC705 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html>`
- :xilinx:`KCU105 <products/boards-and-kits/kcu105.html>`
- :xilinx:`VC707 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-v7-vc707-g.html>`
