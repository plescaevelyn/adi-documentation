===============================================================================

225 MHz High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI®) transmitter

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`ADV7511` is a 225 MHz High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI®)
transmitter designed for applications requiring high-performance video and
audio over HDMI. The ADV7511 supports HDMI 1.4 features including 3D video
and xvYCC™ color spaces.

The ADV7511 is integrated into several Xilinx evaluation boards including
Artix-7, Kintex-7, Virtex-7, and Zynq platforms. This reference design
provides the video and audio interface between the FPGA and the on-board
ADV7511.

The video uses a 16-bit 422 YCbCr interface (except VC707 which uses 36-bit
444 RGB interface) and the audio uses a single-bit SPDIF interface.

Features:

- HDMI 1.4 compliant transmitter
- Support for video resolutions up to 1080p
- Integrated HDCP engine with key storage
- Audio support via I2S, S/PDIF, or DSD
- On-chip EDID buffer
- RGB, YCbCr 4:4:4, and YCbCr 4:2:2 color space support
- CEC support
- 225 MHz maximum pixel clock

Applications:

- Video processing and distribution
- Set-top boxes and DVD/Blu-ray players
- Gaming consoles
- Professional AV equipment
- FPGA development and prototyping

Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our
:ref:`EngineerZone forums <help-and-support>`, but before that, please make
sure you read our documentation thoroughly.

To better understand the :adi:`ADV7511`, we recommend using the evaluation
boards with the ADV7511 integrated on them.
