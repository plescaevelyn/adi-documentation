IIO DEMO project
================

IIO DEMO Overview
-----------------

IIO DEMO project is independent of a physical device and should be used as
reference, when creating a new iio application for a new iio device.

IIO DEMO project emulates two devices: 1 16-bit ADC and 1 16-bit DAC by using
two emulated drivers: adc_demo and dac_demo.

No-OS Build Setup
-----------------

No-OS Clone
~~~~~~~~~~~

No-OS Build Guide
-----------------

Clone NO-OS with the ``--recursive`` flag:

::

   git clone --recursive `no-OS <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS>`_

If however you've already cloned NO-OS without the ``--recursive`` flag, you may initialize all the submodules in an existing NO-OS clone with:

::

   git submodule update --recursive --init

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

Prior to building a no-OS project, it is required to set up some environment
variables so that the build process may find the necessary tools (compiler,
linker, SDK etc.).

Use the following commands to prepare your environment for building no-OS
projects:

.. collapsible:: Linux (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Make sure the GNU Make version you are using is >= 4.2.

   

.. collapsible:: Intel (Click to expand)

   Assuming the SDK is installed at this path:

      ::

         /path/to/intel
         └── intelFPGA
             └── 18.1

      Run:

      ::

         $ source no-OS/tools/scripts/platform/intel/environment.sh /path/to/intel/intelFPGA 18.1

   .. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

      Assuming the Vitis 2022.2 is installed at this path:

      ::

         /path/to/xilinx

      ::

         $ source /path/to/xilinx/Vitis/2022.2/settings64.sh

   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      -  Install `stm32cubeide <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html>`_ (latest version) to default location ``/opt/stm32cubeide``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEIDE=/path/to/your/stm32cubeide`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install `stm32cubemx <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html>`_ version 6.5.0 to default location ``/opt/stm32cubemx``. If you'd rather install it at a different location, run ``export STM32CUBEMX=/path/to/your/stm32cubemx`` in the terminal used for building.
      -  Install python (if not already present) and make sure python command executes Python3 (not Python2). This can be easily achieved by running the following command ``sudo apt install python-is-python3``.

   .. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

      -  Install the `Maxim Micros SDK <https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/software-description.html/swpart=SFW0018720A>`_.
      -  Set the MAXIM_LIBRARIES environment variable to the MaximSDK/Libraries path (the default should be ~/MaximSDK/Libraries).

   .. collapsible:: Mbed (Click to expand)

      -  Install Mbed CLI 1 as per guide here: https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.15/build-tools/install-and-set-up.html .Usually the following steps should be sufficient: ``sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git mercurial gcc-arm-none-eabi`` and ``sudo python3 -m pip install mbed-cli pyelftools==0.29``.
      -  Configure the compiler location with Mbed CLI. This can be carried out
         by running the "mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH
         "path-to-your-gcc-compiler"" in Command Prompt.

   .. collapsible:: Pico (Click to expand)

      -  Clone the `Raspberry Pico SDK <https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk>`_.

      -  Manually Install ``ARM.CMSIS pack (5.7.0+)`` (refer to `cces_user_guide#how_to_install_or_upgrade_packs_for_cces <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029/tools/cces_user_guide>`_)
      -  Make sure you don't have multiple versions of ADuCM302x DFP and ARM
         CMSIS packs installed.

      .. important::

         Please install all the necessary packs locally and then manually import
         them in CrossCore

      Common Issues with environment setup:

      -  Makefiles searches for the CCES_HOME in its default installation directory. It may happen that multiple version are installed and may not work. To select a ``CCES_HOME`` run ``export CCES_HOME=/opt/analog/cces/2.10.0``

.. collapsible:: Windows (Click to expand)

   .. important::

      Open up a Git Bash as Administrator once and run the ``tools/scripts/git-bash.sh`` script. Close the window. You only need to do this once per Git Bash installation.

   .. important::

      Activate `Windows Developer Mode <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#activate-developer-mode>`_.

         make PLATFORM=pico

   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      Make sure you have the .ioc file in the project directory, then type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=stm32

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.

   .. collapsible:: ADuCM3029 (Click to expand)

      The ADuCM3029 projects also contain a ``pinmux_config.c`` file which contains pin configuration instructions.

      ::

   .. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

      To build a project, type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=...

      The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.

   .. collapsible:: Mbed (Click to expand)

      .. important::

         Make sure that the virtual environment is activated (environment name
         enclosed in parenthesis appears in the git terminal) and that the
         packages from prerequisites were installed.

      To build a project, type:

      ::

         make PLATFORM=mbed TARGET_BOARD=...

      The ``TARGET_BOARD`` specifies the board for which the project is built. If not specified, it defaults to ``SDP-K1``.

      ::

         $ export PLATFORM=aducm3029
         $ make

   .. collapsible:: STM32 (Click to expand)

      Assuming you've installed STM32CubeMX at C:\\stm32cubemx and STM32CubeIDE
      to C:\\stm32cubeide, run these commands prior to building to let the build
      system know where they are installed:

      ::

         $ export STM32CUBEMX=/c/stm32cubemx
         $ export STM32CUBEIDE=/c/stm32cubeide

      Make sure you have the .ioc file in the project directory, then type:

      ::

         $ make PLATFORM=stm32

      If during the project generation you get a dialog saying that you are using an .ioc file generated with an old CubeMX version, click ``Continue``. ``Migrate`` is also a valid option but only if you know what you are doing.

      If you're trying to use an .ioc file generated with a newer CubeMX than the one installed on your machine, you will get a prompt that asks you to upgrade your installation to the new version, there is no other choice than to click ``OK`` and then manually upgrade.

The build process creates a **build** directory in the project folder:

::

   build
   ├── app
   ├── bsp
   ├── obj
   ├── project_name.elf
   └── tmp

Running/Debugging
-----------------

Once the ``.elf``, ``.hex`` or ``.bin`` file has been generated, make sure the board is powered on, JTAG cable connected and use the following commands to upload the program to the board or debug.

Uploading the binary to target is achieved with:

::

   $ make run

This feature is not implemented for some platform-OS combinations. Instead, use
the following command to launch the IDE to handle flashing and debugging:

::

   $ make sdkopen

.. collapsible:: Maxim (Click to expand)

   To debug a project, type:

   ::

      make PLATFORM=maxim TARGET=... run

   The ``TARGET`` specifies the chip for which the project is built and run. If it is missing, ``max32660`` will be used. At the moment, the available targets are: ``max32650``, ``max32655``, ``max32660``, ``max32665``, ``max32670``, ``max32690`` and ``max78000``.

.. collapsible:: Xilinx (Click to expand)

   **Booting from SD Card**

   You may also boot a Xilinx project from an SD card, copy the generated
   build/BOOT.BIN file onto the first partition of the card, ensuring it is
   formatted as FAT32. Insert the card, set the jumpers for SD boot, and power
   on the system.

   **Remote host**

   For Xilinx project you can flash the board connected to a remote host. On the remote host make sure to start ``hw_server``. On your development environment run

   ::

      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_HOST=<remote host ip>
      $ export XSCT_REMOTE_PORT=<remote host hw_server port>
      $ make run

   By default the ``hw_server`` port should be 3121.

Use the following command to launch the SDK associated to the used platform in
order to be able to debug graphically by clicking the debug button:

::

   $ make sdkopen

For more details about the available make rules, `check out this page <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/no-os/make>`_.

.. collapsible:: Running/Debugging in WSL

   If you use WSL you can not test the boards on Linux because it does not support USB. If you will try to load the binary into the target with the command **make run**, you will encounter the following error:

   .. important::

      no targets found with "name =~ "APU\*" && jtag_cable_name =~ "\*::jtagtarget\*"". available targets: none while executing "error "no targets found with "`params(filter)". available targets:$target_list""...

   If you use WSL (Ubuntu) and want to connect to JTAG with a board, you have to
   switch the USB device from Windows to WSL. To do this, the following steps
   must be followed:

   ::

       * It is recommended to have a version of Windows 10 or 11.
       * You must have all updates installed in WSL.
           To be able to see the kernel version, the WSL version, and other features, in WSL (Ubuntu) you can enter the command:

   ::

      :~$ uname -a
      Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 02:56:13 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

   WSL should have a kernel version of 5.10.60.1 or later. You also need to run
   WSL2.Testing was done on version 22.4 of Ubuntu.

   ::

       * You need to install the `usbipd-win <https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases>`_ project. Installation can be done manually, with a few clicks.
       * You need to install from WSL, the user space tools for USB/IP and a database of USB hardware identifiers: 

   ::

      :~$ sudo apt upgrade
      :~$ sudo apt update
      :~$ sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
      :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip $(command -v ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1) 20

   If the last command does not work, try:

   ::

      :~$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1` 20

   If there is a device connected to the USB port, it can be checked from the
   Device Manager. When connecting via JTAG, in Device Manager, the device will
   appear in the Universal serial Bus controllers section as USB Serial
   Converter.

   To attach the JTAG (or any USB device) from Windows to WSL we must do the
   following:

   ::

       * Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the command:

   For this command, a list of all connected USB devices will be displayed in
   Windows, a brief description of them and their status: If they are/are not
   attached to the WSL instance. The JTAG appears in the cmd list but is not
   attached to a WSL instance.

   In WSL enter the following command:

   ::

      :~$ lsusb
      Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
      Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

   A list of all attached USB devices will be displayed here. At this moment we
   will only see roots hubs.

   ::

       * To attach a USB device to WSL enter the following command in Command Prompt:

   ::

      > usbipd wsl attach -b <BUSID>

   BUSID represents the ID for the USB device for which we want to attach it in
   WSL.

   ::

      > usbipd wsl attach -b 10-1

   After running usbipd wsl list, it can be seen that the JTAG is now attached
   in WSL.

   In WSL if you run: lsusb we have:

   ::

      Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
      Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0403:6014 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232H Single HS USB-UART/FIFO IC
      Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

   If Device Manager checks the USB device attached in WSL, it will no longer
   appear in the list of devices.

   ::

       * If you want to return to the initial settings (the USB device must be attached to Windows): The USB device must be disconnected and connected to the computer or in Command Prompt, run the following command:

   ::

      > usbipd wsl detach -b <BUSID>

Example Project Execution on Linux
----------------------------------

IIO Example
~~~~~~~~~~~

Because this project does not require any hardware, it can be run also locally
on your Linux OS.

Makefile Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to build the IIO example project for a specific platform make sure you
have the following configuration in the Makefile:

::

   # Select the example you want to enable by choosing y for enabling and n for disabling
   IIO_EXAMPLE = y
   IIO_TRIGGER_EXAMPLE = n

When running make command, specify the platform you want to build it for, as
shown below:

::

   // ADUCM platform
   make PLATFORM=aducm3029
   // Linux platform
   make PLATFORM=linux
   // STM32 platform
   make PLATFORM=stm32
   // XILINX platform
   make PLATFORM=xilinx
   // PICO platform
   make PLATFORM=pico

In this case, we are going to build the project for Linux platform, using the
command:

::

   no-OS/projects/iio_demo$ make PLATFORM=linux

Project Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the build is successful we can run the application, using the command:

::

   no-OS/projects/iio_demo$ ./build/iio_demo.out

Now, by running iio_info in the Linux terminal, we can see the emulated IIO
devices, as shown below:

::

   no-OS/projects/iio_demo$ iio_info -u ip:127.0.0.1
   Library version: 0.24 (git tag: 735ac65)
   Compiled with backends: local xml ip usb serial
   IIO context created with network backend.
   Backend version: 1.1 (git tag: 0000000)
   Backend description string: 127.0.0.1 no-OS analog 1.1.0-g0000000 #1 Tue Nov 26 09:52:32 IST 2019 armv7l
   IIO context has 3 attributes:
       no-OS: 1.1.0-g0000000
       ip,ip-addr: 127.0.0.1
       uri: ip:127.0.0.1
   IIO context has 2 devices:
       iio:device0: adc_demo (buffer capable)
           2 channels found:
               voltage0: adc_in_ch0 (input, index: 0, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: adc_channel_attr value: 1111
               voltage1: adc_in_ch1 (input, index: 1, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: adc_channel_attr value: 1112
           1 device-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: adc_global_attr value: 3333
           1 debug attributes found:
                   debug attr  0: direct_reg_access value: 0
   ERROR: checking for trigger : Invalid argument (22)
       iio:device1: dac_demo (buffer capable)
           2 channels found:
               voltage0: dac_out_ch0 (output, index: 0, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: dac_channel_attr value: 1111
               voltage1: dac_out_ch1 (output, index: 1, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: dac_channel_attr value: 1112
           1 device-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: dac_global_attr value: 4444
           1 debug attributes found:
                   debug attr  0: direct_reg_access value: 0
   ERROR: checking for trigger : Invalid argument (22)

It can be observed that two iio_devices are found: **adc_demo** and **dac_demo**. Each device has a device specific attribute (adc_demo: **adc_global_attr** and dac_demo: **dac_global_attr**) and a debug attribute for direct register access.

It can also be observed that each device has two voltage-type channels and each
channel has a channel specific attribute:

-  adc_demo: adc_in_ch0, adc_in_ch1
-  dac_demo: dac_out_ch0, dac_out_ch1

If ENABLE_LOOPBACK is not defined in src/app_config.h, then a sine loop will be
returned when reading a buffer from adc_demo device. This can be achieved using
iio_readdev command or using IIO Osc.

::

   iio_readdev -u ip:127.0.0.1 -b 400 -s 400 adc_demo > samples.dat

For IIO Osc, connect to the device and use the plot functionality to view the
data, as shown below:

|image1|

If ENABLE_LOOPBACK is defined in src/app_config.h, then the dac_demo device can
also be used to upload data to the buffer used by adc_demo (the data given to
the dac will be looped back to the adc device). If no data is loaded, the
default data will be shown, which is 0. In order to write data to dac_demo, you
can use either iio_writedev command or DAC Data Manager plugin from IIO Osc.
When using iio_writedev, we can use iio_readdev to read back the data we wrote,
as shown below:

::

   // write 400 samples to dac
   cat sample_sine.dat | iio_writedev -u ip:127.0.0.1 -b 400 -s 400   dac_demo
   // read 400 samples from adc -> should be the same as the one we wrote previously
   iio_readdev -u ip:127.0.0.1 -b 400 -s 400 adc_demo > dac_samples.dat

For IIO Osc, connect to the device and use the DAC Data Manager to load data.
Then use the plot functionality to view the loaded data. It can be seen how
plotted data is changing when new data is loaded:

IIO Trigger Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Makefile Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to build the IIO trigger example project for a specific platform make
sure you have the following configuration in the Makefile:

::

   # Select the example you want to enable by choosing y for enabling and n for disabling
   IIO_EXAMPLE = n
   IIO_TRIGGER_EXAMPLE = y

The following steps are perform on Linux platform.

By running iio_info, we can see the emulated IIO devices, as shown below:

::

   no-OS/projects/iio_demo$ iio_info -u ip:127.0.0.1
   Library version: 0.24 (git tag: 735ac65)

   IIO context has 3 attributes:
       no-OS: 1.1.0-g0000000
       ip,ip-addr: 127.0.0.1
       uri: ip:127.0.0.1
   IIO context has 3 devices:
       iio:device0: adc_demo (buffer capable)
           2 channels found:
               voltage0: adc_in_ch0 (input, index: 0, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: adc_channel_attr value: 1111
               voltage1: adc_in_ch1 (input, index: 1, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: adc_channel_attr value: 1112
           1 device-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: adc_global_attr value: 3333
           1 debug attributes found:
                   debug attr  0: direct_reg_access value: 0
           No trigger assigned to device
       iio:device1: dac_demo (buffer capable)
           2 channels found:
               voltage0: dac_out_ch0 (output, index: 0, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: dac_channel_attr value: 1111
               voltage1: dac_out_ch1 (output, index: 1, format: le:S16/16>>0)
               1 channel-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: dac_channel_attr value: 1112
           1 device-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: dac_global_attr value: 4444
           1 debug attributes found:
                   debug attr  0: direct_reg_access value: 0
           No trigger assigned to device
       trigger0: adc-demo-sw-trig
           0 channels found:
           1 device-specific attributes found:
                   attr  0: trigger_now ERROR: No such file or directory (2)
   ERROR: checking for trigger : No such device (19)

It can be observed, that in this case a new device is available,
adc-demo-sw-trig. This device can be used as a trigger to sample data from
adc_demo device. This is a software trigger, meaning that the trigger is
activated by software, when performing writes to its attribute. In this case the
name of the attribute is trigger_now.

The writing to the trigger_now attribute can be performed using the iio_attr
command as follows:

::

   iio_attr -u ip:127.0.0.1 -d trigger0 trigger_now 1

This command will write the value 1 to the trigger_now attribute of trigger0
device and it will activate the trigger one time. If we want to obtain 10
samples, we need to run the command 10 times.

The following python script can be used to send automatically the iio_attr
command:

::

   import sys
   import os

   my_uri = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) >= 3 else "ip:127.0.0.1"
   my_samples = sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) >= 3 else 200

   print("Executing trigger_now attribute for trigger0");
   print("for uri: " + str(my_uri))
   print("for " + str(my_samples) + " samples\n");
   i = 0
   while i < int(my_samples):
       i+=1
       os.system("iio_attr -u "+my_uri+" -d trigger0 trigger_now 1 \n")
       print("triggered "+str(i)+" times\n" )

Below, you can see an example with software trigger usage:
