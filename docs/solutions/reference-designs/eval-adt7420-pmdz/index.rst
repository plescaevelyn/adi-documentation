EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ
==================

High-Accuracy Digital Temperature Sensor PMOD.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ` is a PMOD form-factor evaluation board for the
:adi:`ADT7420`, a high-accuracy digital temperature sensor offering breakthrough
performance over a wide industrial range. The sensor contains an internal band
gap reference, a temperature sensor, and a 16-bit ADC to monitor and digitize
the temperature to 0.0078 deg C resolution. By default, the ADC resolution is
set to 13 bits (0.0625 deg C). The ADC resolution is user-programmable and can
be changed through the serial interface.

The ADT7420 is guaranteed to operate over supply voltages from 2.7 V to 5.5 V.
Operating at 3.3 V, the average supply current is typically 210 uA. The device
also has a shutdown mode that powers down the device and offers a shutdown
current of typically 2.0 uA at 3.3 V. The ADT7420 is rated for operation over
the -40 deg C to +150 deg C temperature range.

Pin A0 and Pin A1 are available for address selection, giving the ADT7420 four
possible I2C addresses. The CT pin is an open-drain output that becomes active
when the temperature exceeds a programmable critical temperature limit. The INT
pin is also an open-drain output that becomes active when the temperature
exceeds a programmable limit. The INT pin and CT pin can operate in comparator
and interrupt event modes.

For general board details and purchasing information, visit the
:adi:`EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ product page <EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ>`.

   EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ Evaluation Board

Hardware
--------

The PMOD board is small in size with dimensions approximately 1 inch in width
by 1 inch in length.

Power Supply Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ, the 3.3 V power comes directly from the host
board it is connected to. The power from the host is generally capable of
providing up to 100 mA at 3.3 V. For complete PMOD power specifications, refer
to the
`Digilent PMOD Interface Specification <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`__.

The fastest way to confirm the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ board is powered is by
checking whether the on-board power LED is illuminated.

Digital Interface (PMOD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMOD interface is a series of standardized digital interfaces for various
digital communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, and UART. These interface
types were standardized by Digilent, which is now a division of National
Instruments.

The specific interface used for the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ board is the extended
I2C. ADI has adopted the extended I2C connector for all PMOD devices which have
an I2C interface. It provides flexibility to add/daisy chain multiple I2C
devices onto the same bus.

Jumper Configuration and Solder Links
--------------------------------------

The EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ has some optional modes of operation to increase
flexibility when using multiple EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ boards in a single system
and to help alert the Over/Under/Critical temperature readings. Each
configuration is explained below.

ADT7420 I2C Address Selection Pins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADT7420 can have up to 4 unique I2C device addresses, depending on the
logic level of Pins A1 and A0. The default configuration for the
EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ is for A1 and A0 to be tied low, so the default I2C address
is 0x48.

   ADT7420 I2C Address Selection Solder Links

If you decide to change the I2C address, then you need to switch the position
of the JP1 and JP2 solder links following the settings in the table below.

ADT7420 Over/Under/Critical Temperature Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADT7420 has the capability of monitoring temperature and alerting users of
Over/Under temperature conditions, as well as Critical temperature events.
Access to these pins and functions are provided via the INT and CT connections
on the board.

   ADT7420 INT and CT Pin Locations

The temperatures are software-configurable, and all you need to do is monitor
the INT (for Over/Under temp conditions) or CT (for Critical temp events) with
respect to GND.

Device Driver Support
---------------------

There are two device driver solutions provided for controlling the
EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ:

1. **ADT7420 no-OS Driver**

   The MAX32655FTHR and ADICUP3029 example applications use the ADT7420 no-OS
   drivers and emulate the Linux IIO framework through the
   `tinyiiod daemon library <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libtinyiiod>`__.
   This driver is used in bare-metal applications, typically running on
   low-power, embedded microcontrollers. The application communicates with the
   host computer via the serial backend, over a USB-UART physical connection.
   This facilitates rapid application development on a host computer,
   independent from embedded code development.

2. **ADT7420 Linux Driver**

   The ADT7420 Linux driver (``drivers/hwmon/adt7x10.c``) is used in
   applications running the Linux operating system, typically on larger
   processors and SoC devices. The ADT7420 Linux driver uses the Industrial
   Input/Output (IIO) framework, greatly simplifying the development of
   application code via the cross-platform Libiio library, which is written in
   C and includes bindings for Python, MATLAB, C#, and other languages.
   Application code can run directly on the platform board, communicating with
   the device over the local backend, or from a remote host over the network or
   USB backends.

System Setup Using ADICUP3029
-----------------------------

The EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ can be used with the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029`.

Demo Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware:

- :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029`
- :adi:`EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ`
- Micro-USB to USB cable
- PC or laptop with USB port

Software:

- `Prebuilt ADT7420 Hex File <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/EVAL-ADICUP3029/releases/download/Latest/ADuCM3029_demo_adt7420.hex>`__
- `ADuCM3029_demo_adt7420 Source Code <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/EVAL-ADICUP3029/tree/master/projects/ADuCM3029_demo_adt7420>`__

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the
ADT7420:

1. **Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the DAPLINK drive** -- This is the
   easiest way to get started with the reference design.
2. **Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES** -- Importing the project
   into CrossCore Embedded Studio allows you to change parameters and customize
   the software to your application, but will require downloading the CrossCore
   toolchain.

Setting up the Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect the EVAL-ADT7420-PMDZ board at connector **P9** of the
   EVAL-ADICUP3029.
2. Connect a micro-USB cable to the P10 connector of the EVAL-ADICUP3029, and
   then connect it to a computer. The final setup should look similar to the
   picture below.
