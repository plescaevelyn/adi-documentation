Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demonstration circuit 2677A (:adi:`DC2677A`) is a reference design for robust
industrial data acquisition applications for the :adi:`LTC2358-18`. The device
supports high voltage measurements with a large input common range and
incorporates input protection that allows up to 400V of continuous input
protection.

The design features an :adi:`ADA4522-2` dual zero-drift operational amplifier
and :adi:`LT6658` dual-output, high current reference for sensor excitation. The
digital interface uses an HSMC (high-speed mezzanine connector), compatible with
the Altera Cyclone V SoCkit and other Altera FPGA evaluation boards supporting
3.3V CMOS I/O.

Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our
:ref:`EngineerZone forums <help-and-support>`, but before that, please make
sure you read our documentation thoroughly.

To better understand the :adi:`LTC2358-18`, we recommend using the
:adi:`DC2677A` evaluation board.
