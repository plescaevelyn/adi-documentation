EVAL-CN0270-EB1Z
=================

4--20 mA Transmitter with HART Communication

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0270 <CN0270>` is a complete 4--20 mA transmitter with HART (Highway
Addressable Remote Transducer) communication system. It uses the :adi:`AD5420`,
a 16-bit 4--20 mA current source DAC, and :adi:`AD5700`/:adi:`AD5700-1`, a low
power HART modem. The circuit can be configured with various process control
current loop standards such as 4--20 mA, 0--20 mA, and 0--24 mA. This circuit
adheres to the HART physical layer specifications as defined by the HART
Communication Foundation, for example, the analog rate of change and noise
during silence specifications.

The EVAL-CN0270-EB1Z evaluation board comes with an onboard ADI microcontroller
that handles communication between the system and the evaluation software. It
also complies with the double PMOD form factor for use with external processors.

Required Equipment
------------------

- EVAL-CN0270-EB1Z evaluation board
- USB-SWD/UART-EMUZ board (included with kit)
- CN0270 Evaluation Software (supplied with provided CD in kit)
- DC power supply, 24 V recommended (12 V to 36 V compatible)
- Multimeter
- USB Type-A plug to USB Mini-B plug cable

General Setup
--------------

- The board is supplied via terminal block **P1**, +24 V DC is recommended.
- The current loop output is derived from terminal block **P3**.
- The **USB-SWD/UART-EMUZ** connects to the **J-Link header** for control
  using the evaluation software.

Installing the Software
-------------------------

#. Extract the file **CN0270 Eval Software.zip** and open the file
   **setup.exe**.

   .. note::

      It is recommended that you install the CN0270 Evaluation Software to the
      default directory path ``C:\Program Files\Analog Devices\CN0270\`` and all
      National Instruments products to ``C:\Program Files\National Instruments\``.

#. Click **Next** to view the installation review page.

#. Click **Next** to start the installation.

#. Upon completion of the installation of the CN0270 Evaluation Software, the
   installer for the ADuCM360 and Segger J-Link Drivers will execute.

   .. note::

      It is recommended that you close all other applications before clicking
      **Next**. This will make it possible to update relevant system files
      without having to reboot your computer.

#. Click **I Agree** to accept the software license agreement and initiate the
   installation.

#. Select only **ADuCM360** and **Segger J-Link Software** on the options
   shown.

   .. important::

      Only these two options are required and included with the installer. To
      download the full ADuCM360 software bundle, please see the Additional
      Info section.

Using the Evaluation Software
------------------------------

Main Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This window contains the block diagram of the system and gives access to the
different controls and indicators.

   * - Control
     - Description
   * - Output Current
     - Accepts a numerical value and sets the output current accordingly.
       Entering a value will also update the DAC Code field to the
       corresponding value.
   * - DAC Code
     - Accepts data in HEX format and sets the output current according to the
       code. Entering a value will also update the Output Current field to the
       corresponding value.
   * - Test Current
     - Enables/disables the test current on the output. Test current slews the
       output between zero scale and full scale.
   * - AD5420 Config
     - Opens the AD5420 Configuration window.
   * - HART Modem
     - Opens the HART Modem window.
   * - HART Activity Indicator
     - Indicates when data has been received on the HART interface. The data may
       be viewed in the HART Modem window.
   * - Reset
     - Resets both the system and evaluation software back to default working
       settings.
   * - Status Bar

   * - Receive Buffer
     - Displays the received HART data. The **HART Page** tab shows the HART
       data divided into the corresponding packets. The **Raw** tab shows all

   * - Transmit Buffer
     - Transmit data defined by the user. The **HART Page** tab allows
       configuring the HART packet to be transmitted (the software will

       **Raw** tab allows defining data to be sent without formatting.
   * - Copy Data from Rx Buffer
     - Copies data from the receive buffer to the transmit buffer.
   * - Transmit Data
     - Transmits HART data based on the values entered.
