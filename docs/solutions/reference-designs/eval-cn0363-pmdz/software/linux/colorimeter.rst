CN0363 Colorimeter Application User Guide
================================================================================

Starting the Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   Before starting the application please close all the running ADI
   IIO Oscilloscope instances.

The CN0363 Colorimeter Application can be launched from the top-left
**"Applications Menu"** in the **"Other"** section.

Analyzing a Sample
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Colorimeter application has three main tabs
`Automated Data Collection`_, `Current/Absorbance Measurement`_ and
the `Sample Library`_.

Automated Data Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :align: center
   :width: 500px

Analyze Sample
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clicking the **Analyze Sample** button will perform an automated sample
analysis which will cycle through all three colors and calculate the
absorbance factor for each of them. The analyzing process will take a
few seconds and a progress-bar will be updated to indicate the current
step. Once the process has completed the absorbance values will be
displayed.

Once the analyzing process has finished it is also possible to either
try to match the sample to a existing sample from the sample library or
save the sample into the sample library for future use.

Match Sample
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clicking the **Match Sample** button will compare the current sample to
all samples in the sample library. If a sample is found that has a
close enough matching score the sample including its name and match
score will be displayed.

Save Sample
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Captured data samples can be saved into the sample library for later
use by clicking the **Save Sample** button. Samples that have been
saved into the library are used in the sample matching process.

Current/Absorbance Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../images/colorimeter_current_absorbance_measurement.png
   :alt: Current/Absorbance Measurement Tab
   :align: right
   :width: 500px

The Current/Absorbance Measurement tab gives direct access to the
LED and gain controls and allows to periodically capture and view raw
data.

On the left side are various controls that allow to change certain
parameters.

-  **Excitation Frequency**: Selects the frequency of the excitation
   signal
-  **Excitation Current**: Selects the current of the excitation signal
-  **LED**: Selects the currently active LED. Options are None, Red,
   Green and Blue.
-  **Reference Channel Gain**: Selects the gain applied for the
   reference channel. Options are 33k Ohm and 1M Ohm.
-  **Sample Channel Gain**: Selects the gain applied for the sample
   channel. Options are 33k Ohm and 1M Ohm.

On the right side are three data plots. One plot each for the reference
channel and the sample channel which show the measured current. And one
plot for the absorbance that is derived from the currents.

Clicking the **Acquire Data** button below the plots will start the
data capture process and the plots will be periodically updated with new
data. Clicking the button while the data capture process is active will
stop it again.

Settings can be changed on the fly while the capture process is active
to see their effect on the captured data.

Sample Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../images/colorimeter_sample_library.png
   :alt: Sample Library Tab
   :align: right
   :width: 500px

The sample library allows to manage and compare previously saved sample
data. On the left side is a list of all samples. On the right side the
absorbance values for the currently selected samples is displayed. It
is possible to select multiple samples by holding the Ctrl key, this
can be used to directly compare the absorbance of multiple samples to
each other.

Samples can also be removed from the library by selecting the sample
and then clicking the **Remove** button. A sample that has been removed
from the library can not be restored.

Calibration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: ../../images/colorimeter_calibration.png
   :alt: Calibration Dialog
   :align: right
   :width: 400px

For optimum performance it is necessary to calibrate the application to
the connected board and the environment. This calibration can be
performed in the calibration dialog which can be opened from the
application's menu. It allows to set the calibration parameters the
LEDs and photo-diodes as well as performing an automated calibration.

Calibration must be performed with distilled water in both the reference
and the sample probes. It is also recommended that during calibration
the photo-diodes are shielded from ambient light.

Start the automatic calibration procedure in the software; from the
Menu bar, open the **Calibration** dialog box, and click **Calibrate**.
Once the calibration is done the calibration values will be updated.

It is also possible to save the current calibration data for later use
by clicking the **Export** button or to load previously saved
calibration data by clicking the **Import** button.

Calibration data includes a zero-offset for each channel and gain
setting, which removes any potential offset that is measured if no
excitation signal is present. The calibration data also includes a gain
factor which expresses the relative relationship of the reference and
sample channel values at full-scale excitation.

Source code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code for the Colorimeter application can be found on the
`Analog Devices GitHub account <https://github.com/orgs/analogdevicesinc>`_
in the :git-colorimeter:`colorimeter repository <colorimeter>`.
