The :adi:`EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ <CN0363>` is a dual channel colorimeter featuring a modulated light source transmitter, programmable gain transimpedance amplifiers on each channel, and a very low noise, 24-bit sigma delta ADC. The output of the ADC connects via a standard PMOD connector to a FPGA. The FPGA takes the sampled data from the ADC and implements a synchronous detection algorithm. By using modulated light and digital synchronous detection, rather than a constant (dc) source, the system strongly rejects any noise sources at frequencies other than the modulation frequency, providing excellent accuracy.

The dual channel circuit measures the ratio of light absorbed by the liquids in the sample and reference containers at three different wavelengths. This forms the basis of many chemical analysis and environmental monitoring instruments used to measure concentrations and characterize materials through absorption spectroscopy.
