People who follow the flow that is outlined have a much better
experience with things. However, like many things, documentation is
never as complete as it should be. If you have any questions, feel free

Hardware guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power supply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ requires an external DC power supply in the range of
6V to 12V fed in the screw terminal. Please take note of the polarity
indicated in the figure below. The fastest way to tell the
EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ board is powered is by seeing if LED labeled PWR_LED
is illuminated. The analog portion of the circuit is supplied by
AVDD = 5 V from an ADP7102 low dropout regulator. The digital portion
of the circuit is supplied by IOVDD = 3.3 V developed from an ADP1720
low dropout regulator. Alternatively, IOVDD can be supplied from the
PMOD connector, VCC, via a link option. The 2.5 V reference voltage is
supplied by the internal 2.5 V reference of the AD7175-2 ADC.

Interfaced with EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ is an FPGA development board
(`ZED Board <https://www.avnet.com/americas/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/zedboard/>`_ rev C or later).
Zedboard requires a separate 12V DC power supply connected to its DC
power jack.

IOVDD Provisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ provides two options of IOVDD using header JP1. If
pin 1 and pin 2 are shorted, IOVDD comes from the regulated supply of
the board. If pin 2 and pin 3 are shorted, IOVDD comes from the PMOD
interface.

Input Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ is designed to accommodate two vials. One is for the
reference container and the other is for the sample container. A
beamsplitter is used to provide similar light source to both vials.
The system requires an initial calibration to compensate for
misalignment between the LEDs, beamsplitter, and photodiodes, as well
as to compensate for any mismatch in the response of the photodiodes.

Vial Holder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The beam-splitter, reference vial, and sample vial are held in a
mechanical holder specifically designed for 18 mm x 30 mm plate
beamsplitter. Slots are provided to hold the reference vial filled with
distilled water and sample vial filled with the test liquid.

Vials and Beamsplitter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vials that can fit inside a 1 inch x 1 inch slot can be used with
EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ. A proper vial preparation is needed to minimize the
error acquired in the colorimeter application.

Cleaning Procedure
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To obtain the most accurate results when taking measurements, the process
below should be taken into consideration:

-  The vials and beamsplitter must be meticulously cleaned.
-  Wash the vials and beamsplitter with soap and deionized water.
-  Soak the vials and beamsplitter in Hydrochloric Acid solution.
-  Rinse with ultra-filtered deionized water.
-  Polish with silicone oil.

Calibration Solution
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For optimum performance it is necessary to calibrate the application to
the connected board and the environment. This calibration can be
performed in the calibration dialog which can be opened from the
application's menu. Calibration must be performed with distilled water
in both the reference and the sample probes.

Digital Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMOD interface is a series of standardized digital interfaces for
various digital communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, and UART.
These interface types were standardized by Digilent, which is now a
division of National Instruments. Complete details on the PMOD
specification can be found at
`Digilent Pmod Interface Specification <https://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf>`_.

The specific interface used for the EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ boards is the
extended SPI. In general ADI has adopted the extended SPI connector for
all PMOD devices which have an SPI interface. It provides flexibility
to add interrupts, general purpose I/O, resets, and other important
digitally controlled functions.

Software guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary program to interact with the EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ is the
:doc:`ADI Colorimeter application <software/linux/colorimeter>`.
It can be used to gather, manage and compare processed sample data from
the EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ.

Since the Linux drivers used for the EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ use the
:ref:`IIO framework <iio>` it is possible
to use the
:ref:`IIO-Scope <iio-oscilloscope>`
to access the raw sample data from the EVAL-CN0363-PMDZ. This is mainly
intended to be used for debugging purposes.

All applications run directly on the ZED board itself.
