ADS-B Airplane Tracking Example (Obsolete)
===============================================================================

`Automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast>`__
(ADS-B) is a cooperative surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines
its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling
it to be tracked. The transponder transmission has the following properties:

- Transmit Frequency: 1090 MHz
- Modulation: Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)
- Data Rate: 1 Mbit/s
- Message Length: 56 μsec or 112 μsec
- 24-bit CRC checksum

The tuning frequency and bandwidth are well within the capabilities of the
:adi:`AD9361` RF transceiver, and the received IQ samples can be detected and
decoded with a variety of software or embedded platform options.

In this section, we will show an airplane tracking example, where the ADS-B
signal is captured by FMCOMMS3 and then streamed from target to Simulink or
MATLAB via the libiio interface. Consequently, the captured signal is
demodulated by the receiver algorithm based upon an existing MATLAB example
:mw:`Tracking Airplanes Using RTL-SDR Radio with MATLAB
<help/supportpkg/rtlsdrradio/examples/airplane-tracking-using-ads-b-signals.html>`,
and all the airplane information is displayed in a table.

MATLAB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MATLAB example can be found here:

- `ADS-B Airplane Tracking Example
  <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools/tree/master/hil_models/ADSB_MATLAB>`__

In this MATLAB example, we combine the data capture process and receiver
algorithm, so you only need to run one script:
`ad9361_ModeS.m
<https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools/blob/master/hil_models/ADSB_MATLAB/ad9361_ModeS.m>`__.

This function mainly consists of three parts:

- Prepare the Mode S signal
- Calculate the earth zone according to user input
- Receive using MATLAB libiio and decode the received signals

Detailed comments have been provided in the function to describe the purpose
of each part.

Depending on how you set up the Tx and Rx LO frequency, there are two ways of
using this model: using pre-captured data and using live data.

Use Pre-captured Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, we are transmitting and receiving some pre-captured ADS-B signals
using FMCOMMS3. These signals are saved in a variable called ``newModeS``. The
requirement for this case is to make **TX_LO_FREQ = RX_LO_FREQ**, and it can be
any LO frequency value that FMCOMMS3 supports.

The AD9361 attribute setting of this example is intended to work with real-world
signal (gain mode = fast attack). Sometimes the pre-captured data is much higher
in amplitude that the real-world signal. In this case, on the IIO Oscilloscope
application, "Tx Attenuation" should be set to maximum so that the received
signal matches real-world signals.

For each data frame being transmitted and received, you will get a result table
as shown below. Due to the nature of pre-captured data, there is plenty of
information there, so it is a good way to verify whether your setup is
appropriate.

.. figure:: ../images/adsb_result.png
   :width: 750

   ADS-B pre-captured data result table

Use Live Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, we are receiving the real-world ADS-B signals over the air,
instead of the signals transmitted by FMCOMMS3. According to ADS-B
specification, it is transmitted at the center frequency of 1090 MHz, so the
requirements for this case is:

- RX_LO_FREQ=1090 MHz, TX_LO_FREQ far away from 1090 MHz in order to avoid
  interference
- Use a proper antenna on the Rx side, which is capable of covering the 1090 MHz
  band, such as an `ADS-B Double 1/2 Wave Mobile Antenna
  <http://www.dpdproductions.com/page_vhf_air.html#adsmobilehalf>`__; using a
  poorly tuned or poorly made antenna will result in a lack of range for your
  air radar.

Besides, if you are in a location with sparse aircraft traffic, it is
recommended to run the model for longer time in order to capture some useful
data. You can tell whether there is any useful data by looking at the spectrum
analyzer. A typical ADS-B spectrum looks like this:

.. figure:: ../images/adsb_spectrum.png
   :width: 700

   Typical ADS-B spectrum

With everything set up properly, in order to run the MATLAB model, simply use
the following command:

.. code-block:: matlab

   [rssi1,rssi2]=ad9361_ModeS('ip','data source',channel);

where ``ip`` is the IP address of your board, ``data source`` specifies the data
source of your received signal. Currently, this example supports 'pre-captured'
and 'live'. ``channel`` specifies whether you are receiving signals using
Channel 1 or Channel 2 of FMCOMMS3.

For example, the following command receives the pre-captured data on
Channel 2:

.. code-block:: matlab

   [rssi1,rssi2]=ad9361_ModeS('192.168.10.2','pre-captured',2);

At the end of the simulation, you will get the RSSI values on both channels, as
well as the result tables shown in the previous case.

The following is an example result we got from the real-world ADS-B signal.
Besides all the airplane information shown in previous case, we are also able to
get the *Flight ID* as highlighted below.

.. figure:: ../images/adsb_result_real.png
   :width: 750

   Real-world ADS-B result table with Flight ID

This result table shows the information of aircrafts appearing during the
simulation. With a proper antenna, this model is able to capture and decode the
aircraft signals in an 80 miles range with FMCOMMS3. Since there are two types
of Mode S messages (56 usec or 112 usec), some messages contain more information
than the other.

Simulink
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The model using Simulink libiio can be found here:

- `ADS-B Airplane Tracking Example
  <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools/tree/master/hil_models/ADSB_Simulink_libiio>`__

This Simulink model is based upon an existing Simulink example provided by
MathWorks:

- `Original MathWorks Example
  <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools/tree/master/hil_models/ADSB_Simulink>`__

The detector and decoding piece comes directly from that model, and we add the
Simulink IIO System object to conduct the signal reception and hardware in the
loop simulation.

The original model works with sample time = 1 and frame size = 1. However, the
Simulink IIO System object works in a buffer mode - it accumulates a number of
samples and then processes them. In order to make the original model works with
the System object, we added two blocks between them: unbuffer to make frame size
= 1 and rate transition to make sample time = 1. By doing this, we can keep the
original model intact.

The Simulink model **ModeS_Simulink_libiio.slx** is shown in the figure below.
We set up the target using *iio_sys_obj* block, and the received ADS-B signal is
post processed by the detector and decoding subsystem.

   ADS-B Simulink model

Depending on how you set up the TX_LO_FREQ and RX_LO_FREQ, this Simulink model
can be run in two modes: using pre-captured data "DataIn" and using live data.
Taking the pre-captured data for example, at the end of the simulation, we can
see the following results in command window:
