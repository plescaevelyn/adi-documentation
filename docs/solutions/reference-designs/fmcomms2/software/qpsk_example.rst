QPSK Transmit and Receive Example
===============================================================================

In this section, we will show a QPSK transmit and receive example, which is
based on :mw:`MathWorks QPSK Transmitter and Receiver Example
<help/comm/examples/qpsk-transmitter-and-receiver-1.html>`. In this example,
FMCOMMS3 is used as RF front-end, which captures the modulated QPSK signals over
the air. These signals are then streamed from target to Simulink via the
``ad9361`` block. The Simulink model is shown in the figure below, where the
blocks of Tx and Rx are grouped in two subsystems.

In order to run this example, your :mw:`MATLAB <products/matlab/>` version
should be **2014b** or higher, and your license needs to include the following
components:

- Communications System Toolbox
- DSP System Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox

The model can be found here:

- `QPSK Tx and Rx Model
  <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools/tree/2017a/hil_models/qpsktxrx>`__

   QPSK Transmit and Receive Simulink model

In this example, we set up the target using the block's properties dialog and a
configuration file. You can double click the ``ad9361`` block in the model to
find out the properties dialog settings. You can open the ``ad9361.cfg`` to look
into the configuration file.

QPSK Transmitter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The QPSK Transmitter is shown in the figure below, which mainly consists of a
baseband QPSK modulator, a raised cosine filter, and a gain block to scale up
the signals before transmission.

QPSK Receiver
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The QPSK receiver is shown in the figure below, which consists of the following
blocks:

- An automatic gain control block
- A raised cosine receiver filter block
- A coarse frequency compensation block
- A fine frequency compensation block
- A timing recovery block

The detailed description of each block can be found at :mw:`MathWorks Help
Document
<help/comm/examples/qpsk-transmitter-and-receiver-1.html#zmw57dd0e8033>`.

Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With everything set up properly, we can run the model and get the results below.
As we can see, with the frequency compensation and the timing recovery, we can
get a clear QPSK constellation.
