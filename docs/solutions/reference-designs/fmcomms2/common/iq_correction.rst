I/Q Correction
===============================================================================

As shown in the previous section, in an FMCOMMS system, the complex
modulation/demodulation scheme is used. In theory, the two baseband signals
(in-phase and quadrature) should be orthogonal to each other with the same
amplitude. However, due to the different channel environments and component
properties [1]_, there is usually offset on the phase and the amplitude, which
sets the context of I/Q correction.

Why I/Q Correction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The I/Q imbalance is commonly seen in any RF front-end that exploits analog
quadrature down-mixing. With an imbalanced I/Q, there will be several problems.

In contrast to an ideal down-converter that performs simple frequency shifting,
a down-converter with I/Q imbalance not only down-converts the desired signal,
but also introduces its image interference. Such image interference, if left
uncorrected, presents an error floor which limits the demodulation performance.
Moreover, although the I/Q imbalance introduced by the LO may be assumed
constant over the signal bandwidth, the mismatches in the subsequent baseband
I/Q amplifiers and filters tend to vary with frequencies. Such frequency
dependent I/Q imbalance is particularly severe in a wideband direct-conversion
receiver and the corresponding estimation and compensation process becomes more
challenging. [2]_

In order to overcome these problems and to realize a successful communication,
it is necessary to implement the I/Q correction in the FMComms system.

Math of I/Q Correction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will use the algorithm introduced in S.W. Ellingson's paper Correcting I-Q
Imbalance in Direct Conversion Receivers [3]_ to conduct the I/Q correction.

Given a single tone that converts the signal from RF to baseband, ideally, the
two baseband signals (in-phase and quadrature) should be orthogonal to each
other with the same amplitude. Without loss of generality, we normalize the
magnitude and the phase, then the two signals can be expressed as:

:math:`I(t) = \cos(\omega t)` and

:math:`Q(t) = \sin(\omega t)`,

where :math:`\omega` is the baseband frequency of the tone.

However, due to the different channel environments and component properties,
there is usually DC bias, as well as the offset on the phase and the amplitude,
which makes the two signals as following:

:math:`I'(t) = \alpha \cos(\omega t) + \beta_I` and

:math:`Q'(t) = \sin(\omega t + \psi) + \beta_Q`,

where :math:`\beta_I` and :math:`\beta_Q` are DC biases on two channels,
:math:`\alpha` stands for the amplitude offset, and :math:`\psi` stands for the
phase offset.

Since the DC biases can be easily found out by calculating the mean value of the
signals, the main challenge is to correct the following two signals:

:math:`I''(t) = \alpha \cos(\omega t)`,

:math:`Q''(t) = \sin(\omega t + \psi)`,

and recover them back to :math:`I(t)` and :math:`Q(t)`. Using Trigonometric
Identities, these two equations can be rewritten in the matrix format:

:math:`\begin{bmatrix}I''(t) \\ Q''(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha & 0 \\ \sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi)\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}I(t) \\ Q(t)\end{bmatrix}`.

Then according to the linear algebra, :math:`I(t)` and :math:`Q(t)` can be
obtained by doing a matrix inverse:

:math:`\begin{bmatrix}I(t) \\ Q(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha^{-1} & 0 \\ -\alpha^{-1}\tan(\psi) & \sec(\psi)\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}I''(t) \\ Q''(t)\end{bmatrix}`.

.. note::

   :math:`\begin{bmatrix}I(t) \\ Q(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}A & 0 \\ C & D\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}I''(t) \\ Q''(t)\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}A & 0 \\ C & D\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}I'(t) - \beta_I \\ Q'(t) - \beta_Q\end{bmatrix}`,

   where :math:`I'(t)` and :math:`Q'(t)` are observed signals, and
   :math:`A, C, D` are correction matrix parameters.

Please refer to the S.W. Ellingson's paper [4]_ for the detailed procedures of
finding out the correction matrix parameters.

Implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the theory introduced in the previous section, the implementation of
I/Q correction is conducted in two steps, namely the correction matrix
calculation and the matrix multiplication. Specifically, in the first step, we
use some software, such as MATLAB or Simulink, to calculate the parameters of
the correction matrix. Then in the second step, we use hardware to implement the
matrix multiplication and obtain the corrected I and Q.

Simulink Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Simulink model is created to calculate the parameters of the correction
matrix. The top level of the model is shown in the figure below:

.. image:: ../images/model_top.jpg
   :alt: Model diagram
   :width: 600

In this model, the amplitude, phase and DC offset of the I and Q signals are
specified by the users. These two signals are :math:`I'(t)` and :math:`Q'(t)`
in the previous section, which serve as the input to the IQcorrect
subsystem. In real-world application, these two inputs can be captured data from
users' systems. For example, the output data from ADC on the receiver side. The
output of the IQcorrect subsystem are the parameters of the correction matrix
(A, C, D). The structure of this subsystem is shown below:

.. image:: ../images/subsystem.jpg
   :alt: Subsystem diagram
   :width: 900

Basically, this subsystem executes Step 2 through Step 7 of the algorithm in
S.W. Ellingson's paper. In order to facilitate the real-world application, this
model supports fixed point data type and sample-based processing. It is noted
that all the averaging operations are implemented by FIR filter.

   You can download the Simulink model from below:

   - :download:`iqcorrection.zip <../resources/iqcorrection.zip>`

   Pay attention to the output data type of each block. It should be defined
   according to the range of the data value of your system. Otherwise, you will
   not get the correct result.

.. note::

   In order to run this model, your MATLAB license needs to include the
   following components:

   - MATLAB
   - Simulink
   - Communications System Toolbox
   - DSP System Toolbox
   - Fixed-Point Designer

   If you want to generate HDL code from this model, the following component is
   also required:

   - HDL Coder

HDL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HDL is implemented for matrix multiplication on FPGA. It takes the
correction matrix parameters as input, and multiplies them with the observed I
and Q signals to get the corrected signals.

Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, the time-domain and scatter plots of I and Q signals from the
Simulink model are shown before and after I/Q correction. Comparing the figures,
it is easy to find the impact of I/Q correction.

Without I/Q Correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before the I/Q correction, it is obvious that the amplitude of the I and Q
signals is very different, and their phase difference is not 90 degrees. The
scatter plot shows an ellipse, which also reflects the imbalance of I and Q.

.. image:: ../images/scatter1.png

With I/Q Correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the I/Q correction, the amplitude of the I and Q signals is identical, and
they are orthogonal to each other. Therefore, the scatter plot shows a perfect
circle centering in the origin.

   This imbalance mainly attributes to the mismatched components in the in-phase
   (I) and the quadrature (Q) branches. Examples include but not limited to an
   imperfectly balanced local oscillator (LO) and/or baseband low pass filters
   (LPF) with mismatched frequency responses.
