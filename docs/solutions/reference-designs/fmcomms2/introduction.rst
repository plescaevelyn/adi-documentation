The AD-FMCOMMS[2345]-EBZ and ARRADIO cards are a high-speed analog modules designed to showcase the :adi:`AD9361` or :adi:`AD9364`, a high performance, highly integrated RF agile transceiver intended for use in RF applications, such as 3G and 4G base station applications and software defined radios. Its programmability and wideband capability make it ideal for a broad range of transceiver applications. The device combines an RF front end with a flexible mixed-signal baseband section and integrated frequency synthesizers, simplifying design-in by providing a configurable digital interface to a processor or FPGA. The AD9361 and AD9364 chip operates in the 70MHz to 6GHz range, covering most licensed and unlicensed bands. The boards, due to discrete external components may have less performance on some of the RF input/output connectors (for example - the FMCOMMS2 and specific connectors on the FMCOMMS5 are specifically tuned to 2.4GHz). The AD9361 and AD9364 both supports channel bandwidths from less than 200kHz to 56MHz by both changing sample rate, and by changing digital filters, and decimation inside the device itself.

The difference between the AD9361 (2 Rx, 2 Tx) and AD9364 (1 Rx, 1 Tx) is the
number of channels. Software, HDL, pinout, etc - is all exactly the same.

.. important::

   While the AD9361 digital interface supports both LVDS and CMOS mode, all the
   FMCOMMS boards have been verified in LVDS mode only. Configuring the digital
   interface in CMOS mode is not tested nor supported on these platforms. This
   is due to the purposefully weak CMOS drivers (To keep the noise off the part
   as much as possible) that are part of the digital interface and the large
   capacitance of the FMC connector.

   
   If you configure any board to work in CMOS mode, and it does not, this is
   expected. If it does work, it just means the combination of AD9361 board,
   AD9361, connectors, carrier layout and FPGA are barely working.
   
   CMOS mode is known to work on platforms without connectors between the AD936x
   and the Digital BaseBande device (like PicoZed SDR).
