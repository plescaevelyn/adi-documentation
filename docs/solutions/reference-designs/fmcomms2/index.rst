Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`EVAL-AD-FMCOMMS2` is an FMC board for the :adi:`AD9361`
(:adi:`design package <en/license/licensing-agreement/ad9361.html>`), a highly
integrated RF Agile Transceiver™. While the complete chip level design package
can be found on the :adi:`ADI web site <ad9361_design_files>`, information on
the card, and how to use it, the design package that surrounds it, and the
software which can make it work, can be found here.

The purpose of the AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ is to provide an RF platform which shows
maximum performance of the AD9361. It's expected that the RF performance of
this platform can meet the datasheet specifications without issues at 2.4 GHz,
and not much anywhere else. This is due to the external Johanson Technology's
`2450BL15B050E <https://www.johansontechnology.com/datasheets/2450BL15B050/2450BL15B050.pdf>`_
2.45 GHz Balun that is on the board. This balun is rated for an operating
frequency of 2400~2500 MHz.

This platform is primarily for hardware / RF investigation and bring up of
various waveforms from a RF team before their custom hardware is complete,
where they want to see waveforms at their frequency of interest, and are not
afraid of changing out the balun if necessary. (Have a look in the
:ref:`Configuration <fmcomms2 hardware configuration-options>`
sections).

The AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ board is very similar to the
:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ <ad-fmcomms3-ebz>`
board with only one exception, the RX/TX RF differential to single ended
balun/transformer. The AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ is more targeted for wider tuning range
applications, that is why we use the
`TCM1-63AX+ <http://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/TCM1-63AX+.pdf>`_ from Mini
Circuits as the RF transformer of choice. We affectionately call the
FMCOMMS3-EBZ the "Software Engineers" platform, and the FMCOMMS2-EBZ, the
"RF Engineers" platform to denote the difference.

Features:

- 2x2 MIMO transceiver with integrated 12-bit DACs and ADCs
- Tunable frequency range: 70 MHz to 6.0 GHz
- Adjustable channel bandwidth: 200 kHz to 56 MHz
- Johanson Technology 2.45 GHz balun (optimized for 2.4 GHz)
- FMC-LPC system board connector
- On-board power solution

Applications:

- Software-defined radio (SDR)
- Point-to-point communication
- Wireless LAN (2.4 GHz)
- LTE/3G femtocell base stations
- General-purpose radio experimentation

Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, check the :ref:`Help and Support <fmcomms2 help-and-support>` page.

To better understand the :adi:`AD9361`, we recommend to use the
:adi:`EVAL-AD-FMCOMMS2` evaluation board.
