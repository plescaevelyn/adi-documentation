Production Testing
==================

Overview
--------

The purpose of the test procedure is to identify connectivity issues, poor
ICs/passive components soldering, and potential manufacturing defects. Some of
the issues are directly identified by explicit, part targeted tests, others are
implicit, by running adjacent tests.

Running the Test Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the Raspberry Pi boots, the test screen will appear on the monitor as
shown below.

.. figure:: images/test_screen.png
   :width: 25em

   Test menu

.. attention::

   If at any point a test fails, you should retry the test suite up to 3 times.

1) Memory/MAXQ1065 Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type **1** into the terminal then press **ENTER** to start the
"1) Memory/MAXQ1065 tests" test suite.

.. figure:: images/test_command_1.png
   :width: 25em

   Starting the Memory/MAXQ1065 tests

If the firmware is successfully written, you should see the "**no fail.txt
found. SUCCESS**" message on the screen.

* Press the **RESET** button on the board (see below).

  .. figure:: images/reset_button.png
     :width: 25em

     Reset button location

* Press **ENTER** on the Rpi keyboard to continue.

* Next, the tests for "UART", "MAXQ1065", "RAM chip 1", "RAM chip 2" and "Flash"
  will automatically run, without the need to intervene. The test results will
  appear on the screen.

* If the previous tests are successful, you will be prompted to visually check
  if some LEDs are on. Type "y" for yes or "n" for no. You may associate their
  name with the silkscreen of the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board.

     :width: 25em

     LED verification prompts

* In case the LED tests are successful, but the ping test fails, swap the
  AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ (DUT) with the reference AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ, and run the test
  again:

  * If the ping test still fails, the current AD-SWIOT1L-SL (DUT) would be
    considered to have failed the testing.
  * If the ping test is successful, the AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ (DUT) is considered to
    have failed the test and should be replaced with another AD-T1LUSB2.0-EBZ
    (DUT) and restart system testing from the beginning.

* If the test passed successfully, the **PASSED** message will appear on the
  screen. Proceed to the next test.

     :width: 25em

     Memory/MAXQ1065 tests passed

2) AD74413R/MAX14906 Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

   It is very important to start running the next tests without the loopback
   terminal block connected. It should be attached once you are prompted to do
   so.

Type **2** into the terminal to start the "2) AD74413R/MAX14906 tests".

.. figure:: images/test_command_2.png
   :width: 25em

   Starting AD74413R/MAX14906 tests

* If any of the tests fail, you should restart the test up to 3 times. Make
  sure to disconnect the terminal block first.

* You will be prompted to visually check if some LEDs are on. Type "y" for yes
  or "n" for no.

  * Testing the 4 green status LEDs: Are the DS1, DS3, DS5 and DS7 LEDs on?
  * Testing the 4 red fault LEDs: Are the DS2, DS4, DS6 and DS8 LEDs on?

  .. figure:: images/test_command_2_prompt.png
     :width: 25em

     LED verification

* After the faults test is done, connect the terminal block and press **ENTER**
  on the Rpi keyboard to run the next tests.

* If the tests are successful, the **PASSED** message will appear.

  .. figure:: images/test_command_2_passed.png
     :width: 25em

     AD74413R/MAX14906 tests passed

3) Program Final Firmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type **3** into the terminal to run "3) Program final firmware".

.. figure:: images/test_command_3.png
   :width: 25em

   Starting Program final firmware

* With the hardware connections as they are, wait for the firmware to be
  written.

* If firmware programming is successful, it should show the "**no fail.txt
  SUCCESS**" message being printed.

* If this step is unsuccessful, a "**FAILED**" message will appear. In such
  case, retry this test up to 3 times.

* Unplug the power cable from the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board and power it using the
  T1L connector of the power supply as shown.

* Make sure the switch is in the position highlighted below (marked as
  "INTERNAL POWER SUPPLY" on the silkscreen next to the S2 switch).

  .. figure:: images/test_command_3_switch_adjustment.png
     :width: 25em

     Switch position for T1L power

* You should visually check if 2 LEDs are on (DS12 and DS9). Type "y" for yes
  or "n" for no.

* If the test passed successfully, the **PASSED** message will appear.

  .. figure:: images/test_command_3_passed.png
     :width: 25em

     Program final firmware passed

After Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Power off the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board by unplugging the T1L cable.
* Flip the S2 switch in the "EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY" position (as highlighted by
  the silkscreen near the switch).
* Disconnect the terminal block so it may be used for the next DUT.
* Proceed to the next untested DUTs and repeat the testing procedure.
* When done testing all the DUTs, type **4** in the terminal to power off the
  Rpi.
