Software Guide
==============

The **ADuCM3029_demo_cn0415** provides a solution for controlling and monitoring
solenoid actuator current, using an :adi:`EVAL-CN0415-ARDZ <CN0415>` shield
installed on an :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` base board. The user interface is
implemented as a command-line interface (CLI) through a serial UART connection.
The project is created using CrossCore Embedded Studio and GNU ARM compiler.

General Description
-------------------

The circuit can be divided into four parts for the purpose of analyzing
interaction with the software project: the supply block, the sense block, the
actuator block, and the overcurrent fault / reset block.

**Supply Block** -- Consists of DC-DC converters and protection circuits. This
block does not interact with the software.

**Overcurrent Fault and Reset Block** -- Controlled by GPIO pins on the
ADICUP3029. If the solenoid current exceeds a resistor-programmed threshold, a
comparator trips off the MOSFET gate driver and notifies the software via a GPIO
signal. The user can then re-enable the driver once the fault condition is
removed.

**Sense Block** -- Consists of a 0.1 ohm current sense resistor, sense
amplifier, filtering, and 14-bit ADC. The ADC is connected to the ADICUP3029
via SPI.

The voltage fed to the ADC with respect to the current passing through the
solenoid is given by:

.. code-block:: none

   V_ADC = I_solenoid * R_sense * 20

Where R_sense = 0.1 ohm.

The code output by the ADC is then calculated:

.. code-block:: none

   CODE = (V_ADC * 2^14) / V_ref

Where V_ref is the reference voltage of the ADC:

- If 12 V on P1 is selected, the supply voltage of the ADC is 5 V and the
  corresponding reference is **4.096 V**.
- If the ADC is powered from Arduino with 3.3 V, the reference is **2.048 V**.

The combined ADC code with respect to current sense:

.. code-block:: none

   CODE = (I_solenoid * R_sense * 20 * 2^14) / V_ref

**Actuator Block** -- Consists of a logic-level to MOSFET driver. The logic
signal is driven by the ADICUP3029's PWM peripheral, allowing the effective
voltage across the solenoid to be varied.

The software implements several functions with the sense and actuator blocks.
PWM frequency and duty cycle can be controlled directly. This mode of operation
would normally be combined with an outer feedback loop in a control system. One
example would be a system in which the solenoid controls air pressure, that is
in turn measured by a pressure sensor, which is then used to determine a new
duty cycle value that brings the pressure closer to the desired setpoint.

PID Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PID control loop allows the solenoid current to be accurately controlled,
compensating for variations in supply voltage and coil resistance. This mode
of operation allows for optimum drive current for 2-state solenoids, minimizing
power dissipation. An additional function allows a higher initial "pull-in"
current to be applied for a short time, after which current drops back to a
lower "hold" current.

   PID Controller Equation

To use the PID controller, it must first be tuned with the right values of
**Kp**, **Ki**, and **Kd**. A simple tuning method:

#. Start increasing **Kp** while keeping **Ki** and **Kd** at 0. Increase
   **Kp** until the actuation time is reasonable and the current overshoot is
   within 5% of the desired value.
#. Start increasing **Ki** until the actuation time is reasonable and the
   current overshoot is within 5% of the desired value.
#. Pick **Kd** as 25% (1/4) of **Ki**.

A dither function allows a low-frequency AC signal to be superimposed,
minimizing mechanical stiction in proportional solenoid applications.

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for
the CN0415:

#. **Drag and Drop** -- Copy the ``.hex`` file to the DAPLINK drive. This is
   the easiest way to get started.
#. **Build and Debug using CCES** -- Import the project into CrossCore Embedded
   Studio to customize the software.

Project Structure
-----------------

The program is composed of three main parts:

#. Board setup, with initialization
#. Calibration
#. Main process

   Software Main Flow Chart

The board's initial parameters can be given in the software in the main function
or by uncommenting the ``FLASH_INIT_PARAMETERS`` define in ``config.h``. The
program initializes timers and UART, SPI, GPIO, and FLASH controllers.

   Board Setup Flow Chart

**Calibration** is done to minimize full-scale error. It sets the control signal
to logic "1" and measures the current, then prompts the user for a manual
measurement with a precision tool. The difference between these two measurements
is stored and used in calculating future values from ADC codes.

   Calibration Flow Chart

The **main process** is the infinite loop in which the program implements CLI,
PID, and dither functionality. The UART is used for the CLI and three different
timers implement the PWM signal, the PID periodic calculation, and the dither
functionality.
