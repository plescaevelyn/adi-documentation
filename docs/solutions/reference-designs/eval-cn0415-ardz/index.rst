EVAL-CN0415-ARDZ
=================

Robust PWM Solenoid Driver with Closed-Loop Current Control.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0415` is a robust pulse-width modulation (PWM) solenoid driver circuit
in an Arduino shield form factor. Target applications include motion control,
latches, clamps, brakes, clutches, proportional gas valves, proportional liquid
valves, and other industrial applications. The circuit provides accurate,
closed-loop current control in 2-state solenoid applications, allowing
low-voltage solenoids to be used over a wide range of supply voltages,
tolerating overvoltage and undervoltage transient conditions caused by
cold-cranking and load-dump conditions.

Initial pull-in current, pull-in time delay, and hold current are independently
adjustable in software, greatly reducing power consumption in applications
where the solenoid is continuously energized. In proportional valve
applications, PWM duty cycle and frequency can be directly controlled by an
external PID controller, and a dither current with programmable frequency and
amplitude can be enabled to reduce mechanical stiction.
