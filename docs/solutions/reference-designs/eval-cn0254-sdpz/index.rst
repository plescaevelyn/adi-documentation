EVAL-CN0254-SDPZ
=================

Isolated 16-Bit, 250 kSPS, 8-Channel Data Acquisition System.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0254` is a cost-effective, highly integrated 16-bit, 250 kSPS,
8-channel data acquisition system that can digitize +/-10 V industrial level
signals. The circuit also provides 2500 V rms isolation between the
measurement circuit and the host controller, and the entire circuit is
powered from a single isolated PWM-controlled 5 V supply.

The :adi:`AD7689` 16-bit, 8-channel, 250 kSPS PulSAR ADC contains all the
necessary components for the multichannel low-power data acquisition system.
It includes a 16-bit SAR ADC, an 8-channel low crosstalk multiplexer, a low
drift reference and buffer, a temperature sensor, a selectable one-pole
filter, and a channel sequencer. The sequencer is useful for continuously
scanning channels, and a microcontroller or FPGA is not required to control
channel switching.

The :adi:`AD8605` and :adi:`AD8608` are low-cost single and quad rail-to-rail
input and output CMOS amplifiers. The :adi:`AD8608` inverts, level shifts, and
attenuates the +/-10 V input signal so that it matches the input range of the
ADC, which is 0 V to +4.096 V when using a +4.096 V reference and a +5 V
single supply. The :adi:`AD8605` acts as an external reference buffer to
provide sufficient driving ability for level shifting. Both feature very low
offset voltage, low input voltage and current noise, and wide signal
bandwidth, therefore making them good choices for a wide variety of
applications.

The :adi:`ADuM3471 <ADUM3471>` is a quad-channel digital isolator with an
integrated PWM controller and transformer driver for an isolated dc-to-dc
converter. It provides the isolated 5 V, 2 W power for the circuit as well
as isolates the digital signals at the SPI interface.

The EVAL-CN0254-SDPZ board connects to ADI's System Demonstration Platform
(SDP) and is powered by a 6 V power supply.

   EVAL-CN0254-SDPZ test setup

#. Connect the 120-pin connector on the EVAL-CN0254-SDPZ to the connector
   marked **CON A** on the :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CB1Z` evaluation (SDP) board.
#. After setting the DC output supply to 6 V output, turn the supply off.
#. With power to the supply off, connect 6 V to **CN2**.
#. Turn on the power supply and then connect the SDP to the PC by using
   the USB-to-miniUSB cable.

.. important::

   Do not connect the USB cable to the Mini-USB connector on the SDP board
   before turning on the DC power supply for the EVAL-CN0254-SDPZ.

Software Setup
--------------

Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Extract **CN0254_Evaluation_Software.zip** and run **setup.exe**.

   .. note::

      It is recommended to install the software to the default path
      ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Analog Devices\CN0254\`` and all National
      Instruments products to ``C:\Program Files\National Instruments\``.
