ARRADIO
=======

The `ARRADIO <https://www.arrow.com/en/products/arradio/terasic-technologies>`_
board is an `HSMC <http://www.altera.com/literature/ds/hsmc_spec.pdf>`_ board by
`Arrow <https://www.arrow.com/en/manufacturers/analog-devices>`_ & `Terasic <http://arradio.terasic.com/>`_
for the :adi:`AD9361`, a highly integrated RF Agile Transceiver™. While the
complete chip level design package can be found on the :adi:`the ADI web site <ad9361_design_files>`.
Information on the card, and how to use it, the design package that surrounds
it, and the software which can make it work, can be found on this page.

The ARRADIO board is not a product of Analog Devices, and questions about
purchase, or returns should go to Arrow. You can purchase the board from
`Arrow's web site <https://www.arrow.com/en/products/arradio/terasic-technologies>`_.

The purpose of the ARRADIO board is to provide an RF platform to which shows
maximum performance of the AD9361. It's expected that the RF performance of this
platform can meet the datasheet specifications without issues at 2.4 GHz, and
not much anywhere else. This is due to the external Johanson Technology's
`2450BL15B050E <https://www.johansontechnology.com/datasheets/baluns/JTI_Balun-2450BL15B050_12-03.pdf>`_
2.45 GHz balun that is on the board. This balun is rated for a operating
frequency of 2400~2500 MHz.

This platform is primarily for hardware / RF investigation and bring up of
various waveforms from a RF team before their custom hardware is complete, where
they want to see waveforms at their frequency of interest, and are not afraid of
changing out the balun if necessary. (Have a look in the
:dokuwiki:`Configuration <resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz/hardware/configuration_options>`
sections).

The ARRADIO board is very similar to the :external+hdl:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ <fmcomms2>`
except it utilizes the HSMC connector which connects to the `Arrow SoCKit <https://www.arrow.com/en/products/sockit/arrow-development-tools>`_.

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our
:ref:`EngineerZone forums <help-and-support>`, but before that, please make
sure you read our documentation thoroughly.
