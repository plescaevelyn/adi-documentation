ARRADIO User Guide
==================

Introduction
------------

The `ARRADIO <https://www.arrow.com/en/products/arradio/terasic-technologies>`__
board is an HSMC board by Arrow and Terasic for the :adi:`AD9361`, a highly
integrated RF Agile Transceiver. It is similar to the
:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ <ad-fmcomms2-ebz>`, except it uses an HSMC connector
which connects to the Arrow SoCKit (Intel Cyclone V SoC).

The board features a Johanson Technology
`2450BL15B050E <https://www.johansontechnology.com/datasheets/baluns/JTI_Balun-2450BL15B050_12-03.pdf>`__
2.45 GHz balun, so RF performance is optimized for the 2400 to 2500 MHz band.
The platform is primarily intended for hardware and RF investigation and
bring-up of various waveforms at the frequency of interest. The balun can be
swapped for different frequency applications (see the
:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ <ad-fmcomms2-ebz>` configuration options).

.. note::

   The ARRADIO board is not a product of Analog Devices. Questions about
   purchase or returns should go to

Creating the Micro-SD Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the :doc:`Kuiper Linux image </linux/kuiper/index>`
and flash it to the Micro-SD card. After flashing, copy the ARRADIO boot
files to the BOOT partition:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /media/<user>/BOOT/socfpga_cyclone5_sockit_arradio
   sudo cp socfpga.dtb /media/<user>/BOOT/
   sudo cp zImage /media/<user>/BOOT/
   sudo cp u-boot.scr /media/<user>/BOOT/
   sudo cp soc_system.rbf /media/<user>/BOOT/
   sudo dd if=preloader_bootloader.img of=/dev/sdX3
   sync

Replace ``/dev/sdX3`` with the raw partition of your SD card.

Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Insert the Micro-SD card with Kuiper Linux image.
#. Connect the ARRADIO board to the HSMC connector on the SoCKit.
#. Connect the VGA monitor, USB keyboard/mouse via OTG, and Ethernet.
#. Set the jumpers as specified in the tables above.
#. Connect the Micro-USB UART cable to the host PC.
#. Connect the 12 V power supply and power on.

Using IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Local mode**: Interact directly via the VGA display, USB keyboard, and mouse
connected to the SoCKit.

**Remote mode**: Connect via Ethernet from a host PC:

#. Open a UART terminal at 115200 baud (8N1).
#. Run ``ifconfig`` on the board to obtain its IP address.
#. On the host PC, launch IIO Oscilloscope and enter ``ip:<board_ip>`` in the
   URI field.

.. important::

   This is a persistent file system. Always shut down properly using
   ``sudo shutdown -h now`` rather than removing power directly.

No-OS Software
--------------

The No-OS bare-metal driver supports two operating modes:

- **2R2T Mode** (default): 2 Receive / 2 Transmit with AD9361 at 122 MHz
  interface clock. Build with ``make`` or ``make DEFINE=2R2T``.
- **1R1T Mode**: 1 Receive / 1 Transmit with AD9364 at 61 MHz interface
  clock. Build with ``make DEFINE=1R1T``.

Building from source requires cloning the HDL and No-OS repositories, then
building each project:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl
   git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS

   # Build HDL project
   make -C hdl/projects/arradio/c5soc

   # Build No-OS project (2R2T mode)
   make -C no-OS/arradio/c5soc

   # Build No-OS project (1R1T mode)
   make -C no-OS/arradio/c5soc DEFINE=1R1T

.. note::

   After the first build, the mode selection is remembered for subsequent
   builds (until a clean). Always verify the compiler flags
   (``-DAD9361_DEVICE=1 -DAD9364_DEVICE=0`` for 2R2T, or
   ``-DAD9361_DEVICE=0 -DAD9364_DEVICE=1`` for 1R1T) match your desired mode.

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

The HDL reference design is based on the
:ref:`AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ <ad-fmcomms2-ebz>` reference design adapted for the
Intel Cyclone V SoC platform with HSMC interface.
