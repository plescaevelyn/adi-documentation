EVAL-ADA4356 Software Documentation
===================================

Overview
========

Software enablement for EVAL-ADA4356 consists of:

-  `HDL for ZedBoard <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/projects/ada4355_fmc/index.html>`_
-  Linux driver
-  :git-pyadi-iio:`PyADI API <adi>`
-  GUI option: Analysis, Control, Evaluation (ACE) software, IIO Oscilloscope

Note that although the GitHub URLs and filenames refer to ADA4355, the software
is for ADA4356 as well.

Digital Interface
-----------------

The EVAL-ADA4356EBZ's HDL firmware has been developed around the ZedBoard. The
embedded Linux stack is based on the IIO (Industrial I/O) architecture, enabling
the host PC to communicate with the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ through the ZedBoard with
tools such as ACE, Python (through the pyadi-iio package), or MATLAB (with the
precision toolbox). Generic, non-specific IIO tools such as IIO oscilloscope,
scopy, and IIO command line tools can also be used to evaluate the
EVAL-ADA4356EBZ’s basic functionality.

The EVAL-ADA4356EBZ interfaces with the ZedBoard through its FMC connector (P3)
to configure the ADA4356’s ADC through the 4-wire SPI in LVDS mode. The table
below shows the LVDS connections.

PyADI API
---------

The pyadi-iio python package is composed of drivers that allow users to control
and evaluate a number of software-enabled ADI parts through python scripts. For
this release, a driver for ADA4356 has been created.

The key drivers used in controlling the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ are as follows:

-  ADA4356: This driver interacts with the board's main IC, the ADA4356 uModule. This read's the device's output.
-  AD7291: This driver controls the AD7291 ADC and is used in the board's self-debug circuit.
-  one-bit-adc-dac: This driver reads and writes the gain and frequency settings
   for the ADA4356.

Refer to the "Using Python (via pyadi-iio package)" section below for key
installations and proper driver usage.

Analysis, Control, Evaluation (ACE) Software
--------------------------------------------

The EVAL-ADA4356EBZ hardware can be controlled and configured through the ACE
Software. ADI’s “Analysis, Control, Evaluation” (ACE) is a desktop software
application that allows the evaluation and control of multiple evaluation
systems from across the Analog Devices product portfolio. The application
consists of a common framework and individual component specific plug-ins.

The controller board supported by ACE for the evaluation of EVAL-ADA4356EBZ is the ZedBoard. For ACE installation and documentation instructions, refer to the `ACE user guide <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/ace/userguide>`_. Once ACE is installed, open the ACE application and search for the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ board plugin in ACE’s plugin manager, then install or update.

Controlling the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ
===============================

Using ACE
---------

The plugin for the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ is available in ACE. The ACE plugin allows
the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ’s gain and frequency settings to be configured, board
supplies to be measured, and the resulting output waveform to be observed.

To control the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ through ACE, the host PC must first be physically
connected to the FPGA using an ethernet cable. The following steps must then be
followed:

-  Open ACE. Within the software, navigate to plugin manager. The plugin manager is where all the available plugins for ADI boards can be found and installed.
-  In the plugin manager, select the “Available Packages” dropdown. This checks for plugins that are available for installation; plugins already installed will not be found under this selection and will be under “Installed Plugins” instead.
-  Tick the checkbox for “Boards”, search for “ADA4356”, then install. If the plugin is not available yet, follow the directions found on this page.
-  Once installation is complete, restart ACE. Upon rebooting ACE, the
   evaluation board hardware should be detected, as seen in the screenshot
   below.

Using IIO Oscilloscope
----------------------

ADI's IIO Oscilloscope can be downloaded `here <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope/releases>`_. Install this in the host PC.

-  Start IIO Oscilloscope. (Note: It may take a little time for the window to
   appear after it is launched; do not click multiple times).

   -  Most of the time, IIO Oscilloscope will scan for and discover ADA4355/6 on its own when it is first opened and show it as ready to connect. If "ada4355" shows up under IIO Devices, the system is ready to connect. Click the "Connect" button in the lower right hand corner to proceed.
   -  If IIO Oscilloscope has not found the ADA4355/6 yet, select "Manual" and
      type in "ip:analog.local" and click "Connect". The password is "analog"
      (all lowercase).

-  When the Capture window opens, check the "voltage0" checkbox under "ada4355" to select the plot channel.
-  Change default number of samples to something higher than 400, for example 8192 (= 2\ :sup:`13`).
-  Click the "Enable All" button; Once the "voltage0" channel has been selected, the orange caution symbols will turn to arrow symbols. To begin reading data, click the gray arrow to "Run". This should display the data being gathered by ADA4356 in the plot screen.
-  To stop data collection, click the red circle where the "Run" arrow used to
   be.

Using Python (via pyadi-iio package)
------------------------------------

Installing the Assets for Python Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In preparation for using the PyADI-IIO package, the following resources must be
downloaded and installed.

**Python 3.x, libiio, pyadi-iio**

Follow these steps to install python:

-  Download a prefered version of Python (should be version 3.8 or higher).
-  Right click on the downloaded .exe file and select “Run as Admin”. This should open the Python dialog box.
-  If this is the only python version to be installed in the device, go ahead and tick the “Add Python 3.x to PATH” checkbox.
-  Select customize installation.
-  In the “Optional Features”, proceed with all features checked and click next.
-  In the “Advanced Options”, make sure the “Install for all Users” checkbox is ticked.
-  Click “install” and wait for completion.

*Running pip as Admin:*

-  On your windows start menu, search for “cmd”. This will show “Command Prompt”; right click on it and select “Run as Admin”.
-  In the command prompt, update the pip package with this line: “py -m pip install --upgrade pip”. If multiple python versions are installed in the device, specifically target your prefered version by adding “-3.x” (replace x with actual version number) after “py”.
-  Wait for successful installation. You now have an updated global instance of
   pip.

Driver Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: For this guide, variables with “my\_” prefix refers to user-defined values.*

ADA4356 Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ADA4356 PyADI driver can be used thru the following commands:

-  **adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri)**

   -  This establishes connection to the on-board ADA4356.
   -  It requires a unique resource identifier (URI) attribute “uri”. Using the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ mounted on a ZedBoard, this URI should be “ip:analog.local”.
   -  This command can be assigned to a variable for easier initialization of
      other attributes.

-  **adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri).rx_buffer_size = my_buffer_size**

   -  This initializes the number of data points to be captured and stored.
   -  User can set this at any value.

-  **adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri).rx_enabled_channels = [0]**

   -  This initializes which channel/s is/are enabled.
   -  Since ADA4356 only has a single channel, this is set to 0 (channel 1 is
      0).

-  **adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri).ada4355_register_write(0x0D,0x00)**

   -  This directly accesses a register of ADA4356. 0x0D accesses the Test Mode,
      and the 0x00 that follows it sets the Test Mode to OFF; this ensures that
      the ADA4356 is not initialized on test mode (which outputs example test
      data rather than actual data).

-  **adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri).rx()**

   -  This captures the data received by the ADA4356’s internal ADC.
   -  The data is in its “codes” form. To convert to voltage, multiply this by
      “0.00012207”, or if user is using the “Nov 10” boot files or later,
      multiply by “adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri).rx_scale”

-  **adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri).rx_destroy_buffer()**

   -  This destroys the buffer, thereby also erasing its contents.
   -  It’s prefered to the buffer and create a new one to capture another set of
      data to free up memory.

-  **Example code:**

   -

.. container:: center round box

   \ ``import adi

         my_uri = "ip:analog.local"
         my_buffer_size = 4096
   
         # Setting the “adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri)” to the “my_4356” variable for
         ease of initializations
         my_4356 = adi.ada4355(uri=my_uri)
         my_4356.rx_buffer_size = my_buffer_size
         my_4356.rx_enabled_channels = [0]
         my_4356.ada4355_register_write(0x0D,0x00)
   
         data = my_4356.rx()*my_4356.rx_scale
         # or: my_4356.rx()*0.00012207
   
   my_4356.rx_destroy_buffer()``\

--------------

AD7291 Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri)**

   -  This establishes connection to the on-board AD7291.
   -  It requires a unique resource identifier (URI) attribute “uri”. Using the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ mounted on a ZedBoard, this URI should be “ip:analog.local”.
   -  This command can be assigned to a variable for easier initialization of
      other attributes.

-  **adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).temp0()**

   -  This returns the temperature reading of the AD7291 in Celsius.
   -  To access its raw readings, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).temp0.raw”.
   -  To access its scale value, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).temp0.scale”

-  **adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).voltageX()**

   -  This returns the voltage output of each channel in millivolts.
   -  To access its raw readings, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).voltageX.raw”.
   -  To access its scale value, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).voltageX.scale”.
   -  The X here must be replaced by a numerical value corresponding to the channel number (minus 1) being read. (i.e., Channel 1 is voltage0, Channel 2 is voltage1, and so on.)
   -  The corresponding channel assignments are as follows:

=========== ================
Parameter   Channel Assigned
=========== ================
3.3V LDO    voltage0
2.5V LDO    voltage1
1.8V LDO    voltage2
1.65V Sense voltage3
=========== ================

-  **adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri)**

   -  This establishes connection to the on-board AD7291.
   -  It requires a unique resource identifier (URI) attribute “uri”. Using the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ mounted on a ZedBoard, this URI should be “ip:analog.local”.
   -  This command can be assigned to a variable for easier initialization of
      other attributes.

-  **adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).temp0()**

   -  This returns the temperature reading of the AD7291 in Celsius.
   -  To access its raw readings, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).temp0.raw”.
   -  To access its scale value, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).temp0.scale”

-  **adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).voltageX()**

   -  This returns the voltage output of each channel in millivolts.
   -  To access its raw readings, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).voltageX.raw”.
   -  To access its scale value, run “adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri).voltageX.scale”.
   -  The X here must be replaced by a numerical value corresponding to the
      channel number (minus 1) being read. (i.e., Channel 1 is voltage0, Channel
      2 is voltage1, and so on.)

-  **Example code:**

.. container:: center round box

   \ ``import adi

   my_7291 = adi.ad7291(uri=my_uri)
   print(my_7291.temp0())
   print(my_7291.voltage0())
   print(my_7291.voltage1())
   print(my_7291.voltage2())
   print(my_7291.voltage3())
   print(my_7291.voltage4())``\

one-bit-adc-dac Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The one-bit-adc-dac can both read and write the logic for setting the gain and
frequency. This driver can be used thru the following commands:

-  **adi.one_bit_adc_dac(uri=my_uri)**

   -  This establishes connection to ADA4356’s digital gain and frequency control.
   -  It requires a unique resource identifier (URI) attribute “uri”. Using the EVAL-ADA4356EBZ mounted on a ZedBoard, this URI should be “ip:analog.local”.

-  **adi.one_bit_adc_dac(uri=my_uri).<channel name>**

   -  This reads the value set on the selected channel name’s parameter; its value is either 0 (LOW) or 1 (HIGH).
   -  The one-bit-adc-dac has a total of 8 logic channels, but only 4 channels
      are used to set the ADA4356. The table below shows the corresponding
      channel assignments.

============== ================ ============ ================

   **EVAL-ADA4356EBZ Current-to-Bits Operation Overview and Evaluation Results**

   
   The EVAL‑ADA4356EBZ provides two methods for generating an input current for
   the ADA4356:
   
   -  **On-board Buffered Howland Current Source (BHCS)** driven by an external voltage source.
   -  **Avalanche Photodiode (APD)** connection via a 3-pin socket.
   
   Both inputs route through a programmable current divider, which can be
   enabled to extend the measurable range by attenuating higher input currents.
   
   Input selection is controlled by populating a single 0‑Ω (0603) resistor as
   summarized below:
   
   +--------------------+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
   | Populated Resistor | SELECTED INPUT                         | Input type | PATH                                  |
   +====================+========================================+============+=======================================+
   | R7                 | APD                                    | Current    | APD1 → ADA4356                        |
   +--------------------+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
   | R17                | APD                                    | Current    | APD1 > Current Divider → ADA4356’s    |
   +--------------------+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
   | R8                 | Buffered Howland Current Source (BHCS) | Voltage    | J1 → BHCS > Current Divider → ADA4356 |
   +--------------------+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
   
   By default, R8 is populated, enabling the BHCS signal path. In this
   configuration, the signal chain operates as follows:
   
   VIN (J1) → Buffered Howland Current Source (BHCS) → Optional Current Divider→
   ADA4356 Input
   
   An external voltage applied at J1 is converted to proportional current by the
   BHCS, optionally attenuated by the current divider, converted to voltage by
   the ADA4356’s programmable gain transimpedance amplifier (PGTIA), and finally
   digitized by the ADA4356’s ADC.
   
   .. container:: outdent

         
         **Voltage-to-Current Conversion via BHCS**

         

   
   The Buffered Howland Current Source converts the applied input voltage into a
   current according to:
   
   .. container:: group

         
         .. container:: third column

                     
                     .. container:: centeralign

                        <m 16>I_BHCS=V_IN/(5×R_S )</m>

                     

         
         .. container:: twothirds column

            Where:

                     
                     .. container:: indent

                        V<sub> IN</sub> is the voltage applied at connector J1.
                        R<sub>S </sub> is the selected BHCS range resistor (R14,
                        R18, or R19). The factor of 5 arises from the internal
                        resistor ratios of the BHCS topology.

                     

         

   
   The resulting current is sourced or sunk into the subsequent signal chain.
   
   **Input Current Range Extension via Current Divider (Optional)**

   
   The input current divider that can be enabled to extend the input current
   range by attenuating the signal current before it reaches the ADA4356’s
   input; This feature is optional and is controlled by the GSEL2 pin (divider
   enabled when GSEL2 = 1; disabled when GSEL2 = 0).
   
   The divider is implemented using the ADG772 (U4) analog switch and series with R22 = 604 Ω. When the divider is enabled, the effective division ratio is primarily determined by the ON resistance of the ADG772 (R\ :sub:`ON`) and R22.
   
   The ADG772 R\ :sub:`ON` is typically 3.8 Ω, and may vary due to:
   
   -  Part-to-part variation
   -  Temperature
   -  Supply voltage
   -  Bias conditions
   
   This variability introduces an added gain error term when the divider is
   enabled.
   
   When the divider is enabled (GSEL2 = 1), the input current is divided as: I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` = I\ :sub:`BHCS_OUT` \* R\ :sub:`ON` / (R\ :sub:`ON` + R22)
   
   Using typical values R\ :sub:`ON` = 3.8 Ω and R22 = 604 Ω: I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` = I\ :sub:`BHCS_OUT` \* 3.8Ω / (3.8Ω + 604Ω) = I\ :sub:`BHCS_OUT` / 160
   
   Where:
   
   -  I\ :sub:`BHCS_OUT` is the BHCS output current.
   -  I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` is the input current presented to the ADA4356.
   
   When the divider is disabled (GSEL2 = 0): I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` = I\ :sub:`BHCS_OUT`
   
   **Current-to-Bits: The ADA4356 Internal Signal Chain**

   
   The ADA4356 includes the following internal functional blocks:
   
   -  Programmable gain transimpedance amplifier (PGTIA)
   -  Fully differential amplifier (FDA)
   -  Low-pass filter
   -  14-bit, 125 MSPS ADC
   
   **Programmable gain transimpedance amplifier (PGTIA)**

   
   The PGTIA converts the input current into a voltage and is internally referenced to V\ :sub:`TIA_REF` = 1.65 V.
   
   The PGTIA output voltage is: V\ :sub:`TIA_OUT` = V\ :sub:`TIA_REF` − I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` \* R
   
   Where:
   
   -  V\ :sub:`TIA_REF` is internal 1.65V TIA reference.
   -  R is selected transimpedance gain.
   -  V\ :sub:`TIA_OUT` is the output voltage of TIA.
   
   For example, if 11kΩ transimpedance gain is selected and I\ :sub:`SIG_IN`\ =80µA, output of TIA will be the following: V\ :sub:`TIA_OUT` = 1.65V − 80μA \* 11kΩ = 0.77V
   
   **Fully Differential Amplifier (FDA)**

   
   The PGTIA output feeds into a Fully Differential Amplifier (FDA), whose inverting input is biased to: V\ :sub:`FDA_REF` = 0.825 V
   
   The FDA output is given by: V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT` = V\ :sub:`TIA_OUT` − V\ :sub:`FDA_REF`
   
   Substituting the TIA relationship: V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT` = (V\ :sub:`TIA_REF` − I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` \* R) − 0.825V
   
   With V\ :sub:`TIA_REF` = 1.65 V, this simplifies to: V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT` = 0.825V − (I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` \* R)
   
   This indicates that the FDA output voltage decreases linearly with increasing input current. The relationship between FDA input and output voltage can thus be derived as follows. V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT` = V\ :sub:`TIA_OUT` − V\ :sub:`FDA_REF` V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT` = (V\ :sub:`TIA_REF` − I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` \* R) − 0.825V V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT` = 0.825V − (I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` \* R)
   
   **14-bit, 125Msps ADC Transfer function**

   
   The FDA output drives a 14-bit ADC with an input range of approximately ±1 V (2 V peak-to-peak). The ADC output code can be modeled as: ADC code = 2\ :sup:`14` \* V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT` / V\ :sub:`ADC_REF`
   
   With VADC_REF = 2 V_PP, this reduces to: ADC code = 2\ :sup:`13` \* V\ :sub:`FDA_OUT`
   
   Substituting the FDA expression derived above: ADC code = 2\ :sup:`13` \* [0.825V - (I\ :sub:`SIG_IN` \* R)]
   
   Note that for I\ :sub:`SIG_IN`\ =0, ADC code will be: ADC code = 2\ :sup:`13` \* 0.825V = 6758
   
   This decreases as current into the ADA4356 increases.

Known Hardware Errata, Rev. A 10/2025 Release
=============================================

-  The onboard current sense based on LT6105 is not wired correctly and cannot
