EVAL-CN0235-SDPZ
=================

Fully Isolated Lithium Ion Battery Monitoring System.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0235` is a fully isolated lithium ion battery monitoring system.
Lithium ion (Li-Ion) battery stacks contain a large number of individual cells
that must be monitored correctly in order to enhance the battery efficiency,
prolong the battery life, and ensure safety.

The 6-channel :adi:`AD7280A` devices act as the primary monitor, providing
accurate voltage measurement data to the System Demonstration Platform (SDP-B)
evaluation board, and the 6-channel :adi:`AD8280` devices act as the secondary
monitor and protection system. Both devices can operate from a single wide
supply range of 8 V to 30 V and operate over the industrial temperature range
of -40 degC to +105 degC.

The :adi:`AD7280A` contains an internal +/-3 ppm reference that allows a cell
voltage measurement accuracy of +/-1.6 mV. The ADC resolution is 12 bits and
allows conversion of up to 48 cells within 7 us. It also has cell balancing
interface outputs designed to control external FET transistors to allow
discharging of individual cells and forcing all the cells in the stack to have
identical voltages.

The :adi:`AD8280` functions independently of the primary monitor and provides
alarm functions indicating out of tolerance conditions. It contains its own
reference and LDO, both of which are powered completely from the battery cell
stack. The reference, in conjunction with external resistor dividers, is used
to establish trip points for the over/undervoltages. Each cell channel contains
programmable deglitching (D/G) circuitry to avoid alarming from transient input
levels.
