EVAL-CN0429-EBZ
================

Electrochemical Gas Sensing Platform with Diagnostics.

Overview
--------

Gas detection instruments are used in a wide range of applications ranging from
home air quality measurement devices to industrial solutions for detecting toxic
gases. Many of these instruments use electrochemical gas sensors. This sensor
technology requires specialized front-end circuitry for biasing and measurement.

By utilizing built-in diagnostics features (such as impedance spectroscopy or
bias voltage pulsing and ramping) it is possible to inspect sensor health,
compensate for accuracy drift due to aging or temperature, and estimate the
remaining lifetime of the sensor right at the edge of the sensor network without
user intervention. This functionality allows smart, accurate sensor replacement
at the individual edge nodes. An integrated, ultra low power microcontroller
directly biases the electrochemical gas sensor and runs onboard diagnostic
algorithms.

The :adi:`CN0429 <CN0429>` circuit shows how an electrochemical gas sensor is
connected to the potentiostat circuit and how it is biased and measured. Common
2-lead, 3-lead, and 4-lead electrochemical gas sensors can be used
interchangeably. The integration of this signal chain dramatically reduces cost,
size, complexity, and power consumption at the sensor node.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Connecting the Electrochemical Gas Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CN0429 is compatible with electrochemical gas sensors in "4-series" form
factor. 2-, 3- and 4-electrode sensors are supported.

.. figure:: cn0429_gas_sensor_dimensions.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

   4-series electrochemical gas sensor dimensions

Examples of sensors supported by this reference design:

- CiTicel 4CF+
- Alphasense CO-A4
- DD Scientific GS+4CO

Temperature and Humidity Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CN0429 gas sensor daughter board includes an IDT HS3002 temperature and
humidity sensor. This sensor is connected to a virtual I2C bus of the
:adi:`ADuCM355` microcontroller. Temperature and humidity values can be used to
implement compensation techniques for electrochemical gas sensors. For more
information about how to obtain sensor data, refer to the
`Command Line Interface (CLI)`_ section.

Connector P1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connector P1 is used for interfacing with the CN0429 board. It provides power
to the board and also enables communication using I2C, SPI, or UART interfaces.
There is also one GPIO available, which can be used as an interrupt input to
wake up the ADuCM355 or provide any other interrupt function.

The connector used on the CN0429 board is Samtec SFM-107-02-L-D. The mating
connector is either TFM-107-02-L-D (surface mount) or TFM-107-01-L-D
(through hole).

Switch Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT Arduino Shield Board (S1 and S2)**

There are two switches present on the EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT board:

.. figure:: sheild_board_switch.jpg
   :align: center

   EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT switch locations (S1 and S2)

- **S1** -- Selects which channel on the EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT is currently
  programmable. This is only needed/used when flashing custom firmware onto the
  EVAL-CN0429-EBZ.
- **S2** -- Selects the communication method for the connected EVAL-CN0429-EBZ
  boards. This should be set to **I2C**.

**EVAL-ADICUP3029 Board (S1 through S5)**

There are 5 switches present on the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` board:

.. figure:: 3029_switch.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

   EVAL-ADICUP3029 switch locations (S1 through S5)

- **S2** -- Routes the UART signals (Tx/Rx) from the ADuCM3029 and has three
  options: USB, Arduino, and WiFi. While in USB mode, the board communicates
  UART over the USB with the PC. **This is the recommended setting.** When
  set to Arduino mode, it establishes UART communication with the Arduino
  shield connected to the ADICUP3029. WiFi mode allows communication with the
  plug-in WiFi module.
- **S5** -- Selects the power source and has two options: Wall/USB and Battery.
  These options allow the user to choose between powering the board using
  USB/DC wall supply or using 2 AAA batteries.
- **S1** -- Reset switch, used to reset the board.
- **S3** -- Boot switch, used to put the board into boot mode for downloading
  firmware. Press and hold the boot switch, then press and release the reset
  switch, and finally release the boot switch to activate boot mode.
- **S4** -- WiFi reset switch, used to reset the externally connected WiFi
  board.

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the
CN0429:

#. Dragging and dropping the ``.hex`` file to the DAPLINK drive
#. Building, compiling, and debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is a version that Analog Devices
creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the **easiest** way to get
started with the reference design.

Importing the project into CrossCore allows you to change parameters and
customize the software to fit your needs, but requires downloading the
CrossCore toolchain.

Downloading Firmware to the ADICUP3029
--------------------------------------

To download the binary file onto the ADICUP3029 board, follow this procedure:

#. Connect the ADICUP3029 board to the PC with a Micro USB cable.
#. If the mbed software does not automatically install,
   `download <https://os.mbed.com/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration>`__
   and install the mbed driver.
#. Verify that you can see a "DAPLINK" device in "This PC".

   .. figure:: cn0429_fw_download.jpg
      :align: center
      :width: 600px

      DAPLINK device visible in Windows file explorer

#. Copy and paste or drag and drop the ``ADuCM3029_demo_cn0428_cn0429.hex``
   file onto the DAPLINK device/folder. This downloads the firmware onto the
   ADICUP3029 board.
#. The DAPLINK device should disappear momentarily and then reappear.
#. If the download fails, you will find a ``FAIL.TXT`` on the DAPLINK device.
#. If the download is successful, the ``.hex`` file will disappear inside the
   DAPLINK device and no ``FAIL.TXT`` file will be present.
#. This completes the firmware installation. Unplug the USB cable.

Software Setup
--------------

Serial Terminal Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-CN0429-EBZ board and :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` board come with
pre-installed base code. The user needs to install a serial terminal software on
their PC to communicate with the board. The recommended software is PuTTY.

#. Open Device Manager through the Windows control panel and plug the
   microcontroller board into the PC. When the board is detected it will
   appear in Device Manager, displaying as USB Serial Device, along with which
   COM port it is connected to.

   different commands available for gas measurements.

Example of System Setup
------------------------

In this section, step by step instructions are provided to configure the system
and the sensor for correct operation. It is recommended to always follow this
procedure.

**Preparing the system:**

#. Plug the :adi:`EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT` board into the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029`
   board.
#. Plug the electrochemical gas sensor to the EVAL-CN0429-EBZ board.
#. Plug the EVAL-CN0429-EBZ board with the sensor to any of the four positions
   on the EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT board.
#. Connect the assembled system to the PC with a MicroUSB cable.
#. Open PuTTY serial terminal, set the COM port to 115200 8N1 configuration,
   and enable forced local echo.
#. Connect to the board using the PuTTY terminal.
#. Wait for 10 seconds. Afterwards, you can start using the system.

The EVAL-CN0429-EBZ boards come pre-programmed and pre-configured. Sensor
configuration needs to be modified according to the datasheet of the sensor
used. Refer to `Sensor Configuration`_ for more details.

.. note::

   If it is necessary to reset the system for any reason (e.g., if more than
   four sensors are being tested), it should be done by power cycling the board
   rather than just pressing the RESET button. This is done by simply
   unplugging the board from the PC.

Programming the CN0429
-----------------------

The EVAL-CN0429-EBZ board comes with pre-loaded base code. However, if the user
wishes to modify the firmware for custom measurements, they need to download and
install IAR ARM 8.30.2 (or above) workbench. The user also needs to download the
ADuCM355 support package.

After installing the software package, there are two options for programming
the EVAL-CN0429-EBZ:

a) Using a stand-alone debugger with a 9-pin Cortex-M adapter
b) Using the on-board debugger on the :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` and the 10-pin
   ribbon cable included with the EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT

Custom Firmware Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although the sensor board ships programmed with tested firmware out of the box,
it is often important to be able to modify the firmware and reprogram the board
with new functionality.

**Using a Stand-Alone Debugger (e.g., J-Link)**

If a stand-alone debugger is available, it can be plugged into P10 of the
EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT directly and no board rework is required. The IAR project
for the sensor board is set up by default for a J-Link/J-Trace debugger. An
adapter cable is typically required to convert the 20-pin connector at the
output of the debugger to the 10-pin connector on the EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT.

**Using the ADICUP3029 On-Board Debugger**

If a stand-alone debugger is not available, the on-board debugger on the
:adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` can be used to program both the EVAL-ADICUP3029 and the
sensor board separately. This does not require any extra equipment beyond what
is included with the boards, but it requires 3 traces to be cut on the
EVAL-ADICUP3029. Once this is done, the SWD connections from the output of the
debugger are disconnected from the ADuCM3029, but these SWD connections are
available at connector P12.

After this rework is done, it is simple to program or debug the ADuCM3029 by
connecting P12 to P14, or to program or debug the ADuCM355 on the sensor board
by connecting P12 on the EVAL-ADICUP3029 to P10 on the EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT.

.. caution::

   Use caution when reworking boards. Protective eyewear should be worn and
   knife safety should be observed carefully. ESD straps are recommended.

Board modifications for on-board debugger programming:

- Cut **SWD_CLK_3029** trace on the primary (top) side of the EVAL-ADICUP3029
- Cut **3029_RESET** trace on the primary (top) side of the EVAL-ADICUP3029
- Cut **SWD_DIO_3029** trace on the secondary (bottom) side of the
  EVAL-ADICUP3029

.. important::

   The two traces **MBED_TX** and **MBED_RX** on the secondary side must NOT
   be cut, or USB communication to the board would no longer work.

After modifications:

- Connect the 10-pin ribbon cable from P12 on the EVAL-ADICUP3029 to P10 on
  the EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT.
- Make sure pin 1 of the cable (red) matches pin 1 on the connector of both
  boards.
- Set S1 on EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT to the appropriate channel of the board to be
  programmed.

**Programming Options**

Both options require IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM (version 8.30.2 or above)
and the ADuCM355 installer to be installed first.

*Option 1: mbed Programming (simplest method)*

- In IAR, go into Project > Options and make sure the project generates a
  ``.hex`` file output when built.
- Find the ``.hex`` file in the ``iar/debug/exe/`` folder and drag it onto the
  DAPLINK drive.
- The drive disappears momentarily and then reappears. The board has been
  programmed as long as there is no ``fail.txt`` in the DAPLINK drive.

*Option 2: IAR Programming/Debugging (allows debugging)*

- In the menu bar, go into Project > Options, then in General Options, set the
  device to ``AnalogDevices ADuCM3029``.
- In Linker > Config, check the box to override the default file:

  - For **CN0429** (gas sensing), choose the custom linker file located at:
    ``C:\Analog Devices\ADuCM355V2.1.0.54\examples\M355_CN0429\iar\ADuCM355_64kSRAM.icf``

  .. note::

     This custom linker file enables use of 64k of SRAM for diagnostics
     (pulse test).

- In Debugger > Setup > Driver, choose CMSIS DAP.
- In the Device description file box, override default and choose
  ``ioADUCM355.ddf``.
- In Debugger > Download, check the box to override default ``.board`` file and
  choose ``FlashADUCM355.board``.
- Click OK, then click Download and Debug.

.. important::

   After programming, the cable must stay connected to P12 on the
   EVAL-ADICUP3029 and either P14 on the ADICUP3029 or P10 on the
   EVAL-M355-ARDZ-INT even during normal operation. If the cable is
   disconnected, the COM port will not appear and there will be a
   ``MAINTENANCE:`` drive instead of the ``DAPLINK:`` drive.

**Installing IAR and ADuCM355 Drivers**

#. Download and install IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM (version 8.32 or above)
   from `IAR Systems <https://www.iar.com/>`__.
#. Activate the IAR workbench through the Help > License Manager option.
#. Register for a license key on the IAR website.
#. Download the ADuCM355 installer from
   ``ftp://ftp.analog.com/pub/MicroConverter/ADuCM355``.
#. Extract the archive and run the installer. The necessary example projects,
   drivers, and files will be installed.
#. Load the CN0429 project in IAR by opening the ``.eww`` workspace file in
   the ``iar`` subfolder of the source code.

Command Line Interface (CLI)
-----------------------------

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CN0429 reference design is controlled using a command line interface. Any
serial port terminal application can be used (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term). Configure
the COM port to 115200/8N1 (115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity bit and 1 stop
bit).

Once the system is programmed and connected to the PC, connect to it using the
serial terminal application. The system is automatically initialized upon
power-up and will print an initialization report.

.. figure:: cn0429_init.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

   System initialization report example

.. note::

   The gas sensor daughter boards require approximately 10 seconds to calibrate
   and start up properly. It is recommended that approximately 10 seconds after
   power is applied to the system, the RESET button S1 is pressed on the
   ADICUP3029 board to ensure proper initialization.

CLI Command Set

Select the Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use any local command, a sensor needs to be selected first. Use the following
command to list all available (detected) sensors:

.. code-block:: none

   sensorsconnected

Afterwards, select the desired sensor, for example:

.. code-block:: none

   defaultsensor 1

This command selects the sensor site. When using local commands, these apply to
the selected site only. When no sensor site is selected, or there is no sensor
connected at the selected site, an ERROR message will be displayed when trying
to execute a local command.

Sensor Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADuCM355 firmware comes with pre-programmed default gas sensor
configuration. In order for the sensor to work correctly, this configuration
needs to be changed according to the sensor specification found in the sensor
datasheet. The following configuration parameters need to be set using the
command line interface:

- Bias voltage [mV]
- Sensor sensitivity [nA/ppm]
- RTIA [ohm]
- RLOAD [ohm]
- Measurement time [ms]

.. note::

   Select the correct sensor site prior to using any of the following commands.

**Bias Voltage**

Bias voltage is the voltage applied between the RE and WE (SE) electrode of
the gas sensor. Its value can be found in the sensor datasheet.

*Example: setting bias voltage to 20 mV:*

.. code-block:: none

   setvbias 20

**Sensor Sensitivity**

Sensor sensitivity value is used to calculate the gas concentration from the
measured current produced by the sensor. If the sensor datasheet only states a
range of currents instead of an exact value, contact the sensor manufacturer
for a more accurate value.

*Example: setting sensitivity to 73 nA/ppm:*

.. code-block:: none

   setsensitivity 73

**TIA Gain -- RTIA**

The RTIA resistor value should be selected to maximize the ADC input range of
+/-900 mV. The RTIA value is calculated using the following equation:

.. math::

   R_{TIA} = \frac{0.9\,V}{Sensitivity \times Max\_Range}

where:

- 0.9 V is the ADC input range
- *Sensitivity* is defined in A/ppm
- *Max_Range* is the sensor's maximum range in ppm

From the table below, select the closest lower value to the calculated RTIA
value.

   R_{TIA} = \frac{0.9}{73 \times 10^{-9} \times 500} = \frac{0.9}{3.65 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 24.7\,k\Omega

Closest lower value to 24.7 kOhm is 24 kOhm, i.e., **<rtia> = 12**.

*Example -- CO sensor: Datasheet value is 47 Ohm. The closest available value
is 50 Ohm:*

.. code-block:: none

   setrload 3

**Measurement Time**

The electrochemical sensor is sampled by the ADC with a certain time period, at
which it performs an average of 10 samples, each 2.2 ms long. The default value
of this time period is 500 ms, but can be configured in the range of
50 -- 32,000 ms.

*Example: setting measurement period to 1000 ms:*

.. code-block:: none

   setmeastime 1000

**Reading Sensor Configuration**

Once the configuration has been performed, use the ``readconfigs`` command to
verify that configuration is complete. This command reads configuration of all
detected sensors.

.. code-block:: none

   readconfigs

Reading Sensor Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all the sensors are configured, sensor data can be obtained. Temperature
and humidity data from the on-board sensor can be read one value at a time with
dedicated commands. Gas data are read as a continuous stream with configurable
update rate.

**Start ADC Sampling**

This local command instructs the ADC of the selected sensor to start sampling
at the time interval configured by the ``setmeastime`` command.

.. code-block:: none

   startmeas

.. note::

   It is not needed to run this command as a part of sensor initialization.
   ADC sampling starts automatically with the default value of 500 ms.

**Stop ADC Sampling**

This local command instructs the ADC of the selected sensor to stop sampling.

.. code-block:: none

   stopmeas

**Start Reading Gas Sensor Data**

Use this global command to start reading gas sensor data from all sensors:

.. code-block:: none

   readsensors

The data is read back as a continuous stream.

   Sensor data continuous stream output

**Stop Reading Gas Sensor Data**

Data stream can be stopped at any time using the ``stopread`` command:

.. code-block:: none

   stopread

**Set Stream Update Rate**

The update rate of the data stream is configurable in the range of 1 -- 3600
seconds. Stop the data stream before using this command.

*Example: setting update rate to 5 seconds:*

.. code-block:: none

   setupdaterate 5

**Read Temperature**

This local command prints the temperature value from the temperature and
humidity sensor on the gas sensor daughter board:

.. code-block:: none

   readtemp

**Read Humidity**

This local command prints the humidity value from the temperature and humidity
sensor on the gas sensor daughter board:

.. code-block:: none

   readhum

Sensor Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This reference design supports two diagnostic measurements of electrochemical
sensors:

- Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
- Bias voltage pulse test

**Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy**

The EIS test is a diagnostics method where sensor impedance is measured at
various frequencies of AC signal injected into the electrochemical sensor
itself. The default set of frequencies supported by the sensor daughter board
firmware is:

1 kHz, 5 kHz, 10 kHz, 20 kHz, 30 kHz, 40 kHz, 50 kHz, 60 kHz, 70 kHz,
90 kHz, 160 kHz, and 200 kHz.

.. note::

   It is possible to add additional frequencies to the EIS test. However, this
   has to be accounted for in both gas sensor daughter board firmware and
   ADICUP3029 firmware.

The test is executed by following these steps:

#. Run the EIS test (``runeis``)
#. Wait for at least 5 seconds until the test is finished
#. Read the test results (``readeis``)

.. code-block:: none

   runeis

.. code-block:: none

   readeis

The results of the EIS test are comma delimited to enable importing the data
to Microsoft Excel or similar tool for further processing. Bode magnitude and
Bode phase values are printed for every measured frequency.

   EIS test results (Bode magnitude and phase)

To obtain the **full set** of results including all magnitudes and impedances,
use the following command:

   Full EIS results including all magnitudes and impedances

The full set of EIS results contains the following values:

- *Frequency [Hz]* -- Frequency at which the data point was taken.
- *Rload+Rsens_real* -- Real part of impedance of the sensor and the load
  resistor.
- *Rload+Rsens_imag* -- Imaginary part of impedance of the sensor and the load
  resistor.
- *Rload_real* -- Real part of impedance of the load resistor only.
- *Rload_imag* -- Imaginary part of impedance of the load resistor only.
- *Rcal_real* -- Real part of impedance of the calibration resistor Rcal.
- *Rcal_imag* -- Imaginary part of impedance of the calibration resistor Rcal.
- *Mag_Rsense+Rload [Ohm]* -- Impedance of the sensor and the load resistor.
- *Mag_Rload [Ohm]* -- Impedance of the load resistor.
- *Mag_Rcal [Ohm]* -- Impedance of the calibration resistor Rcal.
- *Magnitude* -- Magnitude of the complex impedance of the sensor. This is the
  ratio of the voltage amplitude to the current amplitude.
- *Phase [deg]* -- Phase of the complex impedance of the sensor by which the
  current lags the voltage.

More information about the AC impedance measurement can be found in the
`ADuCM355 Hardware Reference Manual
<https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/ADuCM355-Hardware-Reference-Manual-UG-1262.pdf>`__.

**Bias Voltage Pulse Test**

This diagnostics method can be used, for example, to detect an open circuit
(i.e., an unplugged sensor). This proved to be a common issue with some
portable instruments which can fall on the ground and the sensor can disconnect
from its socket.

The principle of this test is applying a small voltage pulse (typically 1 mV
for <200 ms) to the sensor electrodes and measuring the current response to
this pulse.

Test execution procedure:

#. Set pulse amplitude (``pulseamplitude``)
#. Set pulse duration (``pulseduration``)
#. Run the pulse test (``runpulse``)
#. Wait for at least 10 seconds
#. Read the test results (``readpulse``)

*Example: setting pulse amplitude to 1 mV:*

.. code-block:: none

   pulseamplitude 1

*Example: setting pulse duration to 100 ms:*

.. code-block:: none

   pulseduration 100

.. code-block:: none

   runpulse

.. code-block:: none

   readpulse

The pulse test results are comma delimited to enable importing the data to
Microsoft Excel or similar tool for further processing.
