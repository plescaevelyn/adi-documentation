Production Testing
===================

.. note::

   This production test procedure applies to **Rev E** of the AD-APARD32690-SL
   board.

Overview
--------

The purpose of the test procedure is to identify connectivity issues, poor
soldering, and potential manufacturing defects. Some of the issues are directly
identified by explicit part-targeted tests, others are implicit, by running
adjacent tests.

Test Process
------------

Enabling Wi-Fi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before starting the testing procedure, make sure the Raspberry Pi is connected
to Wi-Fi.

#. After the RPi boots the OS, press **CONTROL+C** to exit the test screen
#. Click on the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to
#. Type in the password

Running the Test Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the Raspberry Pi reboots, the test screen will appear on the monitor as
shown below.

.. figure:: images/test_screens.png
   :width: 40em

   Test menu screen

The following test menu should appear:

.. code-block:: text

   Please enter your choice:
   1) Firmware and memory test
   2) System Test
   3) WI-FI Flash Test
   4) Power-Off Pi

1) Firmware and Memory Test
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Type "1" into the terminal then press **ENTER** to start
**1) Firmware and memory test**.

During this step, make sure the jumpers are in the correct position:

* **P38** and **P56** jumpers are inserted
* **P50** and **P55** are on position 2-3

   Jumper positions for firmware and memory test

If the firmware is successfully written, you should see the message:
"no fail.txt found. SUCCESS"

Press the reset button on the board when prompted:

   Reset button location

.. note::

   In case a failure occurred, a "FAILED" message will be displayed and you
   will be prompted to enter a new command.

   If at any point a test fails, you can retry the test suite up to 3 times.

After the first test is passed, a green "PASSED" message will appear on the
screen.

.. figure:: images/firmware_and_memory_test_passed.png
   :width: 40em

   Firmware and memory test passed

2) System Test
""""""""""""""

Type "2" into the terminal and press **ENTER** to start **2) System Test**.

.. note::

   In case a failure occurred, a "FAILED" message will be displayed.

After the test is passed, a green "PASSED" message will appear on the screen.

.. figure:: images/system_test_passed.png
   :width: 40em

   System test passed

3) Wi-Fi Flash Test
"""""""""""""""""""

Type "3" and press **ENTER** to start **3) Wi-Fi Flash Test**.

Make sure the jumpers are in the correct position:

* **P50** and **P55** jumpers are on position 1-2
* **P38** and **P56** jumpers are removed
* **P57** jumper is ON

Final Firmware Test
"""""""""""""""""""

Go back to **1) Firmware and memory test** and run it one more time. Make sure
jumpers are in the correct position as stated earlier in this document:

* **P38** and **P56** jumpers are inserted
* **P50** and **P55** are on position 2-3

.. note::

   If at any point a test fails, you should retry the test suite for up to
   3 times.

Pass Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After tests **1) Firmware and memory test**, **2) System Test**,
**3) Wi-Fi Flash Test**, and the final **1) Firmware and memory test** have
successfully passed, you can consider the DUT as being functional.

Place the jumpers in their final position:

* **P38**, **P56** installed
* **P55**, **P50** on position 2-3

4) Power-Off Pi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you are done testing, press "4" and press **ENTER** to power-off the
Raspberry Pi.
