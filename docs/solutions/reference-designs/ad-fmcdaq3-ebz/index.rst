Overview
--------

The :adi:`AD-FMCDAQ3-EBZ` is an FMC board featuring the :adi:`AD9680` dual,
14-bit, 1.25 GSPS, JESD204B ADC, the :adi:`AD9152` dual, 16-bit, 2.5 GSPS,
JESD204B DAC, the :adi:`AD9528` clock, and power management components. It is
clocked by an internally generated carrier platform via the FMC connector,
comprising a completely self-contained data acquisition and signal synthesis
prototyping platform. In an FMC footprint (84 mm × 69 mm), the module's
combination of wideband data conversion, clocking, and power closely
approximates real-world hardware and software for system prototyping and design,
with no compromise in signal chain performance.

Features:

- FMC-compatible form factor, powered from a single FMC connector
- Provides two channels of ADC and two channels of DAC with full synchronization
  capabilities
- Includes schematics, layout, BOM, Gerber files, HDL, Linux® drivers, IIO
  Oscilloscope, VisualANALOG
- AD9680: JESD204B (subclass 1) 4-lane coded serial digital outputs, SFDR: 80
  dBc at 1.0 GHz AIN, 2 GHz usable analog input full power bandwidth
- AD9152: JESD204B (subclass 1), supports complex signal bandwidths up to 800
  MHz, selectable 2×, 4×, 8× interpolation filters

Applications:

- Electronic test and measurement equipment
- General-purpose software radios
- Radar systems
- Ultra wideband satellite receivers
- Signals intelligence (SIGINT)
- Point-to-point communication systems
- Multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) radios
- Automated test equipment

Recommendations
---------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our :ref:`EngineerZone
forums <help-and-support>`, but before that, please make sure you read our
documentation thoroughly.

To better understand the :adi:`AD9680` / :adi:`AD9152`, we recommend using the
:adi:`AD-FMCDAQ3-EBZ` evaluation board.
