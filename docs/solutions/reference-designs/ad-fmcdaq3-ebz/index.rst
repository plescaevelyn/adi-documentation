Introduction
------------

The AD-FMCDAQ3-EBZ module is comprised of the :adi:`AD9680` dual, 14-bit,
1.25 GSPS, JESD204B ADC, the :adi:`AD9152` dual, 16-bit, 2.5 GSPS, JESD204B
DAC, the :adi:`AD9528` clock, and power management components. It is clocked
by an internally generated carrier platform via the FMC connector, comprising a
completely self contained data acquisition and signal synthesis prototyping
platform. In an FMC footprint (84 mm x 69 mm), the module's combination of
wideband data conversion, clocking, and power closely approximates real-world
hardware and software for system prototyping and design, with no compromise in
signal chain performance.

  directly to the carrier. The IIO Oscilloscope application launches
  automatically on the desktop.
- **Remote**: Connect USB UART to your host PC and plug an Ethernet
  cable into the carrier RJ45 connector. Use ``ifconfig`` on the UART
  terminal to obtain the board IP address, then connect using the IIO
  Oscilloscope on your host PC via **Settings > Connect** with the URI
  ``ip:<board_ip>``.

.. note::

   This is a persistent filesystem. Always shut down properly from the
   terminal (``sudo shutdown -h now``) before disconnecting power, otherwise
   the SD card may be corrupted.

Functional Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system consists of four functional partitions: transmit path, receive
path, clocking, and power supply.

   :width: 600

   AD-FMCDAQ3-EBZ functional block diagram

**Transmit**

The reference design generates the signals for :adi:`AD9152` either from an
internal DDS or external memory (via VDMA). The internal DDS consists of four
independent signal generators with programmable phase offset and frequency.
These four signal generators are paired to create two tones that are
interleaved and driven to the DAC.

**Receive**

The reference design transfers the received data from the :adi:`AD9680` to DDR
via DMA. An optional off-line FFT core may be used to generate a spectrum
plot.

**Clocking**

The system is clocked through an on-board crystal (100 MHz). The clock path
mainly consists of the :adi:`AD9528` which up-converts this signal to
~3.7 GHz, and then divides this back down to any integer divider of this
~3.7 GHz output.

The default reference design uses the following configuration:

- Crystal generates a fixed clock frequency of 100 MHz
- AD9528 creates:

  - 1233 MHz for the DAC sample rate
  - 1233 MHz for the ADC sample rate
  - 616 MHz for the reference clocks to the FPGA

These clocks can be changed. The :adi:`AD9528` drives both the ADC and DAC.
The AD9528 has various clock banks. For more details, download the
:adi:`AD9528 evaluation board software <EVAL-AD9528>` and explore the
different settings.

**Power**

The board receives all power from the FPGA board through the FMC connector.
The monitoring function of the board's DC voltages is accomplished using the
:adi:`AD7291` SAR ADC.

   :align: center
   :width: 600

   AD7291 voltage monitoring block diagram

The VADJ pin from the FMC connector is used for supplying the translators
VCCA voltage. Supported voltage values of this pin are: 1.2 V / 1.5 V /
1.8 V / 2.5 V / 3.3 V.

**Front-end Design**

For differential to single-ended conversion and for minimizing 2nd harmonic
distortion in transmitting and receiving, a double-balun configuration is used
for the TX and RX front-end interface. For more topology detail and design
insights, refer to:

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

The reference design is a processor based (ARM, Nios II or Microblaze)
embedded system. The device interfaces are shared by the same set of
transceivers followed by the individual JESD204B and ADC/DAC cores. The
cores are programmable through an AXI-lite interface. The data path consists
of independent DMA interfaces for the transmit and receive paths.

   Intel block diagram

Digital Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The digital interface consists of 4 transmit and 4 receive lanes running at
12.33 Gbps (default). The transceivers then interface to the cores at
128 bits at 308.25 MHz. The data is sent or received based on the
configuration (programmable) from separate transmit and receive chains.

DAC Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DAC data may be sourced from an internal data generator (DDS, pattern or
PRBS) or from the external DDR via DMA. The internal DDS phase and frequency
are programmable.

ADC Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADC data is sent to the DDR via DMA. The core also supports PN monitoring
at the sample level. This is different from the JESD204B specific PN sequence
(though they both use the same equation).

Control and SPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The device control and monitor signals are interfaced to a GPIO module.
The SPI signals are controlled by a separate AXI based SPI core.

No-OS Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The no-OS bare-metal software supports the following carriers:

- :xilinx:`ZC706 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-z7-zc706-g.html>`
- :xilinx:`KCU105 <products/boards-and-kits/kcu105.html>`

Building and running the no-OS project requires building the HDL first.
The build flow is developed around GNU make. The prerequisites are that
``vivado`` (or ``quartus``) and ``make`` can be run from a shell.

Building the HDL:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd hdl/projects/daq3/kcu105
   make

   cd hdl/projects/daq3/zc706
   make

Building the no-OS software:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd no-OS/fmcdaq3/kcu105
   make

   cd no-OS/fmcdaq3/zc706
   make

Running the no-OS software (requires JTAG and UART connections):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd no-OS/fmcdaq3/kcu105
   make run

The best place to start in the no-OS code is the main function in
``fmcdaq3.c``. It shows how individual components of the data path chain are
initialized and programmed for the application.
