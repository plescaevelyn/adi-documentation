.. warning::

   The :adi:`AD-FMCADC7-EBZ` is a **legacy product**
   and is no longer actively supported. This documentation is provided for
   reference only.

What you need depends on what you are trying to do. As a minimum, you need to
start out with:

Hardware prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. The AD9625-based evaluation board: :adi:`AD-FMCADC7-EBZ`
#. An FPGA carrier platform. Our supported ones can be found in the
   :ref:`Quick start guide <ad_fmcadc7_ebz quickstart>`.
#. A signal source for the analog input connectors (J202 for single-ended,
   J201 for differential): -15 dBm input level
#. A UART cable for serial console access (115200 baud, 8N1)
#. A Micro/Mini-USB Cable
#. An Ethernet cable (required for Linux)

Software prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, for basic functionalities regarding visualizing the data captured
from the ADC, we use the following:

#. :ref:`iio-oscilloscope`, a graphical tool for capturing and displaying IIO
   device data
#. :external+scopy:doc:`Scopy <index>` v2.0 or later (must include the IIO
   plugin)

.. note::

   :adi:`ADI <>` does not offer FPGA carrier platforms for sale or loan;
   getting one yourself is the normal part of development or evaluation.
