Fast Precision ADCs KWIK Lecture + Lab
======================================

General Description
-------------------

The Fast Precision ADCs Know-how with Integrated Knowledge (KWIK) Lecture and
Lab is a training module regarding Precision Fast ADCs with integrated digital
filters. It is a combination of a lecture and a hands-on activity to understand
how to drive such fast precision ADC and how to take advantage of the digital
filters for noise performance improvements and antialiasing filtering.

On one hand, it provides lecture materials around sampled data system,
antialiasing, how to drive a SAR ADCs and how the challenges increase with
speed, as well as how to use digital filters to help achieving optimal
performance.

On the other hand, the hands-on activity allows the user to measure signals with
the EVAL-AD4080ARDZ Arduino form factor eval board, using ADALM2000 to both
generate signals and measure them in the oscilloscope, as well as capturing the
data stream coming from the ADC and generate time domain and frequency domain
visualizations. Using IIO it also allows to configure the 20-bit 40-MSPS SAR ADC
(AD4080) in order to check the benefits of the different digital filter option
available.

Objective
---------

The Fast Precision ADCs KIWIK Lecture and Lab aims to understand the easy drives
features on fast precision ADCs, as well as the benefits of using the digital
filtering options available on-chip in the AD4080. Beyond theory slides, the
user get to practice and play around with some physical hardware to see live all
this options as well the impact on noise and antialiasing does the on-chip
digital filter have.
