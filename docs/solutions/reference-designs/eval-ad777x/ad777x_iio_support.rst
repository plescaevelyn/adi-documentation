AD777x IIO Application
======================

Introduction
------------

This page gives an overview of using the ARM platforms supported (default is
Mbed) firmware application with Analog Devices AD777x Evaluation board(s) and
SDP-K1/Nucleo-L552ZEQ controller board. This example code leverages the ADI
developed IIO (Industrial Input Output) ecosystem to evaluate the AD777x family
of devices by providing a device debug and data capture support. The code
provides support to MBED and STM32 platforms.

IIO oscilloscope is used as client application running on Windows-os, which is
ADI developed GUI for ADC data visualization and device debug. The interface
used for communicating client application with firmware application (IIO device)
is UART (Note: SDP-K1 can also support high speed VirtualCOM port @1Mbps or
higher speed for faster data transmission). The firmware application
communicates with IIO device using ADI No-OS drivers and platform drivers low
level software layers. SDP-K1 for MBED and Nucleo-L552ZEQ is used as controller
board, on which IIO firmware application runs and using above software
libraries, the IIO firmware communicates with IIO device.

Evaluating AD777x Using IIO Ecosystem
=====================================

Running IIO Oscilloscope (Client)
---------------------------------

Open the IIO Oscilloscope application from start menu and configure the serial
(UART) settings as shown below. Click on refresh button and AD777x device should
pop-up in IIO devices list.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/product-support-software/ad77x_iio_osc_init.png
   :align: center
   :width: 800

Click 'Connect' and it should by default open the data ‘Capture’ window. You can
drag aside or close this window to see the main ‘Debug and DMM’ tab window.

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/product-support-software/ad777x_iio_osc_windows.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

Select the device from ‘Device’ pop-up list on ‘Debug’ tab window. This will
make available all device specific and channel specific attributes.

   :width: 800

Configure/Access Device Attributes (Parameters)
-----------------------------------------------

The IIO Oscilloscope allows user to access and configure different device
parameters, called as 'Device Attributes“. There are 2 types of attributes:

-  Device Attributes (Global): Access/Configure common device parameters.
-  Channel Attributes (Specific to channels): Access/Configure channel specific
   device parameters.

How to read and write attribute:

-  To 'Read' an attribute, simply select the attribute from a list or press 'Read' button on left side.
-  To 'Write' an attribute, select attribute value in the 'value field' and
   press 'Write' button.

Using DMM Tab to Read DC Voltage on Input Channels
--------------------------------------------------

DMM tab can be used read the instantaneous voltage applied on analog input
channels. Simply select the device and channels to read and press start button.

*\*Note: The voltage is just instantaneous, so it is not possible to get RMS AC voltage or averaged DC voltage. Also, when using DMM tab, do not access/use the Data Capture or Debug tab as this could impact data capturing. Both DMM scan and data capture uses different methods of conversion. The DMM data is read using single conversion, while data capture uses continuous conversion mode of operation.*

Data Capture from IIO Device
----------------------------

To capture the data from AD777x IIO device, simply select the device and
channels to read/capture data. The data is plotted as “ADC Raw Value” Vs “Number
of Samples” and is just used for Visualization. The data is read as is from
device without any processing. If user wants to process the data, it must be
done externally by capturing data from the Serial link on controller board.

.. warning::

   The DMM or Debug tab should not be accessed when capturing data as this would impact data capturing. Both DMM scan and data capture uses different methods of conversion. The DMM data is read using single conversion, while data capture uses continuous conversion mode of operation.More info here: `Data Capture using IIO App <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/product-support-software/data-capture-using-iio-app>`_

Access Register map of IIO Device
---------------------------------

This tab is used to access the device registers in byte mode.

Python Environment and Scripts
------------------------------

Data capture can be achieved with clients other than the IIO Oscilloscope as well. A possible option using ADI's pyadi-iio library in python has been demonstrated in the forthcoming sections. The *ad777x_data_capture.py* is capable of achieving the same.

AD777x Firmware Structure
=========================

.. image:: https://wiki.analog.com/_media/resources/tools-software/product-support-software/fw_structure.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

app_config.h
------------

This file can be used to:

-  Select the 'Active Device' to evaluate by changing '#define DEV_AD7770' macro. Default active device is AD7770.
-  Configure the pin mapping of AD7770 w.r.t Arduino Header on Controller Board.
-  Select the platform in which the firmware needs to be used. MBED and STM32 platforms are supported now. Select the active platform by modifying the '#define ACTIVE_PLATFORM' to 'MBED_PLATFORM' or 'STM32_PLATFORM' depending on the requirement.
-  Select the DATA_CAPTURE_MODE to set the data capturing to CONTINUOUS_DATA_CAPTURE or BURST_DATA_CAPTURE
-  Switch between two modes- SPI_MODE and TDM_MODE which can be chosen
   accordingly via the INTERFACE_MODE macro.

.. important::

   Note that the maximum Output Data Rate of the device can be leveraged by
   selecting the TDM_MODE in the STM32 platform. There is a limit in the maximum
   achievable ODR while in SPI_MODE.

ad777x_user_config.c
--------------------

This file defines the user configurations for the AD777x, such as SPI parameters
(frequency, mode, etc) and other init parameters used by No-OS drivers to
initialize AD777x device (e.g. required GPIOs, software/hardware mode, etc).
These are the parameters loaded into device when device is powered-up or
power-cycled.

ad777x_iio.c
------------

This file defines getter/setter functions for all the device and channel
specific attributes (related to AD777x devices) to read/write the device
parameters. The majority of device specific functionality is present in this
module.

ad777x_support.c
----------------

This file contains all the support functions utilized in the firmware

app_config_mbed.c
-----------------

This file contains all the extra parameters specific to mbed platform

app_config_stm32.c
------------------

This file contains all the extra parameters specific to STM32 platform. There
might be a need to change certain parameters if any board other than the
Nucleo-L552ZEQ is chosen.

No-OS Drivers for AD777x
------------------------

The no-os drivers provide the high level abstracted layer for digital interface
of AD777x devices. The complete digital interface (to access memory map and
perform data read) is done in integration with platform drivers.

The functionality related with no-os drivers is covered in below 2 files:

-  ad777x.c
-  ad777x.h

.. tip::

   It is hoped that the most common functions of the AD777x family are coded, but it's likely that some special functionality is not implemented. Feel free to consult Analog Devices :adi:`Engineer-Zone <engineerzone>` for feature requests, feedback, bug-reports etc.
