Multi-Chip Synchronization with the Quad-MxFE + Calibration Board
==================================================================

The Quad-MxFE Platform, in conjunction with the
:doc:`16 Tx / 16 Rx Calibration Board <calboard>`, has demonstrated multi-chip
synchronization (MCS) of the four :adi:`AD9081` on the system. MCS provides the
user with a known, **deterministic phase** after each power cycle for a given
operating frequency. The platform provides MATLAB scripts which can be tweaked
for a particular customer application to showcase MCS on their own system.

It is helpful to define a few terms prior to a MCS discussion.

- **Phase Alignment**: The input RF phases to each ADC channel are identical and
  the output RF phases from each DAC channel are identical such that full dynamic
  range and phase noise system-level benefits can be realized
- **Phase Determinism**: The phase relationship with respect to Rx0 of each
  channel is known, but not necessarily identical, after full power cycle. This
  allows for factory calibration look-up tables (LUTs) to be populated for
  setting boot-up NCO phase offsets for all channels
- **Phase Coherency**: The phase relationship of each channel is maintained with
  respect to Rx0 after changing NCO frequency from a calibrated frequency X,
  then changed to frequency Y, and then changed back to frequency X. This allows
  for factory calibration to be maintained over multiple frequencies
- **Multi-Chip Synchronization (for AD9081/AD9082)**: A process which simplifies
  a required system level calibration algorithm, and which uses both NCO
  Master-Slave Sync and One-Shot Sync to provide Tx and Rx phase determinism
  when using multiple MxFEs in a system

The :adi:`AD9081` contains digital signal processing (DSP) blocks on-silicon to
allow for channel-to-channel digital phase and/or amplitude calibration
techniques. Some of these phase adjustment knobs occur at the
numerically-controlled oscillators (NCOs) residing in the 4x Coarse (Main)
Digital Up/Down Converters (DUC/DDCs) and 8x Fine (Channelizer) DUC/DDCs.
Additionally, on the Rx side, on-silicon programmable finite impulse response
(pFIR) blocks allow for equalization of both phase and amplitude for all Rx
channels in the system. Each of these DSP blocks must be synchronized when
dealing with multiple MxFE chips in a system.

Multi-chip synchronization using the AD9081/AD9082 is achieved with the help of
two distinct features within the chipset:

- **One-Shot Sync**: Helps to align baseband data and some internal clocks
- **NCO Master-Slave Sync**: Helps to align the multiple NCOs spanning across
  all the chips on the platform

There are multiple signals on the platform which are used to achieve MCS. SYSREF
signals are used to help achieve One-Shot Sync. GPIO signals are used to
implement NCO Master-Slave Sync. Additionally, to achieve MCS while the system
undergoes a change in thermal gradients requires use of the PLL phases sent into
the device clock pins of each MxFE.

   MCS goals overview

One-Shot Sync
-------------

The one-shot sync feature first requires that the user defines the JESD link
parameters (such as M, N', L, etc.) and then configures the synchronization
logic for any desired SYSREF averaging (if using continuous SYSREF pulses).
Additionally, desired LEMC delays can be used to force the LEMC to be generated
at a certain delay after the SYSREF edge. After this is completed, the user then
enables the one-shot sync bit within each digitizer IC and then requests that
SYSREF pulses be sent to each IC within the same clock cycle.

For the Quad-MxFE Platform, analog fine delays have been introduced within the
:adi:`HMC7043` clock buffer IC to allow synchronous SYSREFs to all digitizer
ICs. A subsequent check can be executed to verify the one-shot sync process
performed successfully by querying registers within each IC which provide
information about the phase relationship between the SYSREF signal and the LEMC
boundary of each IC's link. Once a stable phase is measured (i.e., once the
SYSREF-LEMC phase register reads '0'), the user then knows that the LEMCs of
all the digitizer ICs are aligned and the user can then proceed to the NCO
master-slave sync process. The subtasks described for the one-shot sync are
contained within an application programming interface (API) provided for the
:adi:`AD9081`.

NCO Master-Slave Sync
---------------------

The NCO master-slave sync feature first assigns one of the :adi:`AD9081` within
the subarray to act as a 'master' chip. All other digitizers are then deemed
'slave' ICs. The master IC is setup such that the GPIO0 pin of this device is
configured as an output and routed to the GPIO0 nets of the three slave digitizer
ICs. The slave GPIO0 nets are configured as inputs.

The user can then choose to trigger on either the SYSREF pulse, the LEMC rising
edge, or the LEMC falling edge. The LEMC rising edge is used as the NCO
master-slave sync trigger source as default for the base control code provided
with the platform, and the GPIO nets are routed through the HDL instead of
locally on the subarray.

Next, the DDC synchronization bits are toggled low and then high to arm the
ADC-side NCO synchronization algorithm. Likewise, the microprocessor align bit
is toggled low and then high to arm the DAC-side NCO synchronization algorithm.
When this trigger is requested, at the next LEMC rising edge the master digitizer
IC asserts high a 'master out' signal through its GPIO0 net. This signal
propagates to the GPIO0 inputs of each of the slave devices. At the next LEMC
edge, all digitizer ICs experience a NCO reset algorithm. After this any LEMC
pulses are ignored with regards to the NCO master-slave sync algorithm.

PLL Synthesizer Phase Adjustments
---------------------------------

The :adi:`ADF4371` PLL synthesizers allow for relative sample clock phase
adjustments injected into each digitizer IC. Thermal drift, and the resulting PLL
phase drift between the sample clock and the SYSREF of each IC, is compensated
by creating a feedback mechanism which ensures that the first transmit channel of
each :adi:`AD9081` is phase-aligned to the first :adi:`AD9081` IC's first
transmit channel.

A receiver data capture is obtained which then allows the user to apply
cross-correlation techniques to determine the complex phase offsets between these
four transmit channels. The :adi:`ADF4371` PLL synthesizer ICs contain within
them a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The measured phase offsets are then
related to the required PLL phase adjustment and the RF frequency.

Using this formula, the :adi:`ADF4371` PLL synthesizer phases can be adjusted by
a new known amount to establish a common Tx baseline between all digitizer ICs
for all power cycles, as shown in the figure below. The open circles for each
channel correspond to the first power cycle, whereas all the other solid dots
correspond to subsequent power cycles.
