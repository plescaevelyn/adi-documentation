General Description
-------------------

This page serves to inform system engineers and software developers about the
calibration board addition kit that pairs with the
:adi:`Quad-MxFE <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/Quad-MxFE.html>`.
This board directly aligns with the 16 Rx and 16 Tx ports on the output of the
Quad MxFE and includes power detectors and loopback configurations for the
system-level calibration of the Quad MxFE. The board contains a PMOD 2A
interface that connects the :xilinx:`VCU118 <products/boards-and-kits/vcu118.html>` Evaluation Board from Xilinx. A DIP
switch and multi-channel ADC/DAC, :adi:`AD5592R`, are also included for
additional control and power readings. The goal of this kit is to enable users to
demonstrate combined-channel dynamic range, spurious, and phase noise
improvements, develop system-level calibration algorithms, and demonstrate
immediate phase determinism.

- Board Standoffs
- VCU118 FPGA Board (optional)

  - :xilinx:`VCU118 <products/boards-and-kits/vcu118.html>`

- Quad MxFE Board (optional)

  - :adi:`Quad-MxFE <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/Quad-MxFE.html>`

Control Interfaces
------------------

The calibration board can be controlled in multiple ways including a DIP Switch
and 2A PMOD Interface. The board can be controlled with 4 main signals:
5045 V1 and 5045 V2 which control an ADRF5045 which switches the transmit path
between combined loopback, low frequency path, high frequency path, and power
detection path, CTRL IND which turns off and on adjacent individual loopback for
each Rx and Tx channel, and CTRL RX COMB which turns off and on the combined
receive loopback path.

The DIP Switch controls 4 signals: 5045 V1, 5045 V2, CTRL IND, and CTRL RX
COMB. The PMOD Interface has 8 signals: 5045 V1, 5045 V2, CTRL IND, CTRL RX
COMB, and 4 SPI Communications signals. The :adi:`AD5592R` is an 8 channel
GPIO/ADC/DAC and it is connected the same control signals as the DIP switch as
well as the three power detectors (:adi:`AD8318`, :adi:`HMC948`, :adi:`LTC5596`),
plus a temperature sensor on the AD8318.

Software Needed
---------------

The following link contains the MATLAB driver for controlling the 16 Tx / 16 Rx
Calibration board via the VCU118 PMOD interface. The driver may be used to
configure the Quad MxFE platform in a Combined Loopback, Individual Loopback,
Combined Tx to SMA, Combined Rx from SMA, Combined Tx Power reading, and Power
readings from the :adi:`AD5592R` and subsequent :adi:`AD8318`, :adi:`HMC948`,
:adi:`LTC5596`.
