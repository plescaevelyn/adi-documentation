EVAL-CN0337-PMDZ
=================

Isolated RTD Temperature Measurement System (PMOD Interface).

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0337-PMDZ <CN0337>` is a completely isolated 12-bit, 300 kSPS
RTD temperature measurement system using only three active devices. It processes
the output of a Pt100 RTD and includes an innovative circuit for lead-wire
compensation using a standard 3-wire connection.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0337` is a 12-bit, 300 kSPS, single-supply, fully isolated RTD
temperature measurement system with 3-wire compensation. The input stage is an
RTD signal conditioning circuit using a compensated 3-wire connection to the
RTD. The circuit translates the RTD input resistance range (100 ohm to
212.05 ohm for a 0 C to 300 C temperature range) into voltage levels compatible
with the input range of the ADC (0 V to 2.5 V).

The circuit incorporates the :adi:`AD8608` op amp, the :adi:`AD7091R` 12-bit
successive approximation (SAR) ADC, and the :adi:`ADuM5401` isolator to create
a standard temperature measurement system.

The design solution is optimized for high precision and low-cost measurement,
with a total unadjusted temperature error of less than 0.039% FSR/C. The total
error after room temperature calibration is less than +/-0.024% FSR/C, making
it ideal for a wide variety of industrial temperature measurements.

The circuit has a 12-pin PMOD connector on board, which can be used for
connection to a customer microprocessor or FPGA.
