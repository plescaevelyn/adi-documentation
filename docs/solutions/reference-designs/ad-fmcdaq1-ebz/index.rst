AD-FMCDAQ1-EBZ
===============

The :adi:`AD-FMCDAQ1-EBZ
<en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ad-fmcdaq1-ebz.html#eb-overview>`
is an FMC board for the high speed DAC :adi:`AD9122` and ADC :adi:`AD9684`.
It is a data acquisition platform that connects the analog world using FMC to
the FPGA.

Introduction
------------

The AD-FMCDAQ1-EBZ module is comprised of the :adi:`AD9684` dual, 14-bit,
0.5 GSPS, LVDS ADC, the :adi:`AD9122` dual, 16-bit, 1.2 GSPS, LVDS DAC,
the :adi:`AD9523-1` clock, and power management components. It is clocked by
an internally generated carrier platform via the FMC connector, comprising a
completely self contained data acquisition and signal synthesis prototyping
platform. In an FMC footprint (84 mm x 69 mm), the module's combination of
wideband data conversion, clocking, and power closely approximates real-world
hardware and software for system prototyping and design, with no compromise in
signal chain performance.
