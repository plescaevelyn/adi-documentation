1. ADPAQ Development module
---------------------------

The ADPAQ development module, allows us to build applications on :adi:`ADuCM3029` microcontroller from Analog Devices that is compatible with the Moduware development platform. The :adi:`ADuCM3029` has the following features/resources-

-  ARM Cortex-M3 processor with a Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
-  Operating frequency upto 26 MHz with serial wire debug interface
-  256 KB of embedded flash memory with Error Correcting Code (ECC)
-  64 KB of configurable system SRAM with parity
-  Hardware cryptographic accelerator supporting AES-128, AES-256, and SHA-256
-  Three SPI interfaces
-  I2C and UART interfaces
-  Serial Port (SPORT) for natively interfacing with converters and radios
-  Programmable GPIOs
-  3 general-purpose timers with PWM support
-  RTC and FLEX_RTC with SensorStrobe and time stamping
-  12-bit, 8 channel SAR ADC

The ADPAQ module is as shown in the figure below. It mainly consists of 3 evaluation headers namely P1, P2 and P3, a debug connector, an :adi:`ADT7410` IC (it is a temperature sensor) and a Moduware connector. The schematics of the ADPAQ module can be viewed from the `link <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sXYZnyS9-nxBX6DQjFaG1EM6rq973gTW>`_. It gives more details about the hardware of the module.

2. Moduware gateway (Mini-Dev board)
------------------------------------

-  The gateway used in this setup is the Mini Dev Board.
-  The Mini-dev board communicates with the module via SPI and it communicates with the mobile application via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).
-  The Mini-Dev Board is powered on by connecting one end of the USB cable to the Power USB slot on the Mini-dev Board and the other end to the computer.
-  The Mini-Dev Board is based on MSP-430 (Micro Controller) and has a BLE IC.
-  The Mini-dev Board has a Moduware connector slot where the module has to be
   inserted. The SPI communication between the module and the Mini-Dev Board
   takes place through these pins.

Setup
-----

-  The ADPAQ module is inserted onto the gateway with the pins facing inward as shown in the image.
-  Power the gateway by connecting the USB cable to the Power USB slot.
-  Once the hardware setup is complete, setting up software toolchain is explained :doc:`here </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adpaq3029/sw_tools_setup>`.
-  In addition to above setup, in order to debug/flash the firmware, debugger
   (EVAL-ADPAQ3029EBZ-DBG) must be connected between PC and ADPAQ Dev module.

-  The ADPAQ module is connected to the debugger via a 10 pin arm debugger cable
   and the debugger is then powered on through the Power USB port as shown in
   the figure below.

-  Once the hardware is set up as described above, the device appears as ``DAPLINK``.

.. important::

   Make sure that the gateway is powered first with the ADPAQ module already inserted on it and then connect it to the debugger. Otherwise the device manager shows ``MAINTENANCE`` instead of ``DAPLINK``.
