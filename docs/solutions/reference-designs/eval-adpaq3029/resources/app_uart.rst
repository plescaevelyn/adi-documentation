-  Upload the ``Arduino code`` into ``Arduino Uno`` board using Arduino IDE.
-  The connections between the Arduino and ADPAQ Board are made as described
   below.

   =================== ============== =================
   Arduino Pins        GPIO port used ADPAQ Header Pins
   =================== ============== =================
   Digital pin 10 (RX) UART0_TX       P2-2
   Digital pin 11 (TX) UART0_RX       P2-3
   GND                 GND            P2-10
   =================== ============== =================
   

-  Apart from these connections, an led along with a 10k resistor has to be
   connected between the Digital pin 12 of Arduino and Ground.

-  Build and run the project
-  The tile has 2 buttons “On” and “Off” buttons. By clicking on those buttons,
   we can control the led that is connected to the pin 12 of Arduino.
