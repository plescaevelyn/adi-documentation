EVAL-ADPAQ3029 - First application [RGB LED]
============================================

-  Setup the hardware as shown :doc:`here. </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adpaq3029/hw_setup>`
-  Make sure to use Dev module with LED. Here is the schematics for one such board - `Nexpaq_Glue_Micro_Dev_Board. <resources/dev_board.pdf>`_
-  Download the following projects from the :doc:`resources </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adpaq3029/resources>` section.

   -  Bootloader
   -  MDK source code

-  Download firmware and Tile application from below

.. admonition:: Download
   :class: download

   `RGB led Firmware <resources/ledapp.zip>`_

   `Tile GUI application <resources/moduware.tile.example-led-rgb.zip>`_

-  The mapping of the RGB LED with the ADPAQ GPIOs is given below

   ========= ==============
   LED color GPIO port used
   ========= ==============
   Red       P1_08
   Green     P0_14
   Blue      P1_09
   ========= ==============

-  Launch the CCES IDE and import the first 3 projects into CCES as explained :doc:`here </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adpaq3029/fw_dev/import_prj>`.
-  Build and flash the firmware binary (\*.bin) as explained :doc:`here </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adpaq3029/fw_dev>`
-  Deploy the tile application as explained :doc:`here </solutions/reference-designs/eval-adpaq3029/tile_dev>`
-  Launch the ``Moduware`` app and pair to the gateway (Mini Dev board)
-  Now you should be able to see tile with ``DevMod``.
