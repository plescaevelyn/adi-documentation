Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS11-EBZ` board is a system platform board for communication
infrastructure applications that demonstrates the Direct to RF (DRF) transmitter
and observation receiver architecture. Using high sample rate RFDAC(s)
and RFADC(s), a number of components in previous generation transmitters can be
eliminated, such as mixers, modulators, IF amplifiers and filters. The objective
being to bring the ADC or DAC as close to the antenna as possible, leading to
possibly more cost effective and efficient communications solution.
It is composed of multi-GSps RF ADC :adi:`AD9625` and DAC :adi:`AD9162`, Cheetah
and Barium respectively. The transmit path contains a balun, low pass filter,
gain block and variable attenuation to produce an output appropriate for a power
amplifier module. Along the observation path, the PA output is coupled back into
the board through a variable attenuator, a balun and finally the ADC. Clock
management is taken care of on board; all the necessary clocks are generated
from a reference. Power management is present as well. We will provide typical
performance data for the entire range (70 MHz – 6 GHz) which is
supported by the platform. This is primarily for system investigation and bring
up of various waveforms from a software team before their custom hardware is
complete, where they want to see waveforms, but are not concerned about the last
1dB or 1% EVM of performance.
