EVAL-CN0532-EBZ
================

MEMS Accelerometer Vibration Sensing with IEPE-Compatible Interface.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0532-EBZ <CN0532>` is a MEMS accelerometer
(:adi:`ADXL1002`) vibration sensing solution with included IEPE-compatible
interface circuitry at 12.5 V bias, plus/minus 2 V output swing, and 4 mA
current consumption. It is suitable for Condition-based Monitoring (CbM)
applications.

Since piezoelectric sensors are predominantly used in CbM applications, IEPE
is the de facto standard in the CbM vibration sensing ecosystem. The IEPE
interface, also commercially known as ICP, is a 2-wire protocol (signal and
ground). In this protocol, a data logger supplies a constant current via the
signal line to the vibration sensor and the sensor modulates the voltage
according to the measurand, typically between 10 V and 30 V.

This reference design enables a direct IEPE piezoelectric sensor replacement
with benefits of high bandwidth, temperature stability, and ultralow noise
MEMS accelerometers. This allows customers to easily evaluate an IEPE MEMS
accelerometer solution for CbM applications on the same ICP piezoelectric
sensor platform.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Sensor Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVAL-CN0532-EBZ is straightforward to set up. A cable and an ICP signal
conditioner (or an IEPE-compatible DAQ, or a current source) are needed. For
electrical setup:

#. Solder a twin twisted wire, coaxial, or shielded cable to the
   EVAL-CN0532-EBZ printed circuit board (PCB). Connect the ground line to
   GND and the supply/signal line to ACC. The output voltage increases for
   positive acceleration in the positive sensitivity axis direction.

#. Connect the other end of the cable to one of the following:

   - An ICP signal conditioner (e.g. PCB 482C64)
   - An IEPE-compatible vibration measurement device (such as LMS SCADAS from
     Siemens or CompactDAQ from National Instruments)
   - A current source (e.g. Keithley 6220) set to 4 mA output current and
     16 V max voltage

      EVAL-CN0532-EBZ with Current Source Setup

   When using a current source, without an external acceleration, the IEPE
   output should be approximately 12 V. In this setup the DC level is not
   removed.

#. Set the acceleration sensitivity (40 mV/G) on the vibration measurement
   equipment. The sensitivity scale of the :adi:`ADXL1002` may slightly vary
   from part to part. The ADXL1002 can be calibrated using a gravity field
   or other reference sensors.

Mechanical Mounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The accelerometer used in this reference design, :adi:`ADXL1002`, is an
ultralow noise and high bandwidth sensor. To achieve the best performance,
proper mechanical design is required to deliver the vibration signal from the
measurement point to the sensor.

Careful consideration in the design of the EVAL-CN0532-EBZ PCB has been taken
to avoid vibration signal distortion to the sensor due to mechanical resonance
of the PCB structure. To best deliver the vibration signal, the
:adi:`EVAL-XLMOUNT1` mechanical interface has been designed with a 3 dB flat
mechanical response of up to 20 kHz.

To use the EVAL-XLMOUNT1 with the EVAL-CN0532-EBZ:

#. Using four 4-40 3/8 inch screws, securely mount the EVAL-CN0532-EBZ to the
   EVAL-XLMOUNT1 mechanical interface. For optimum performance, use all four
   screws.
#. Firmly mount the EVAL-XLMOUNT1 to the vibration platform or shaker table
   using an M6 or similar diameter screw. Ensure that the sensitivity direction
   of the ADXL1002 is aligned with the platform's main vibration direction.
#. Follow the steps for proper sensor connection outlined above.
