Targets of Safety Function,SIL2 low demand according to IEC-61508
Wording of the Safety Function,The AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL shall measure a temperature value with a connected RTD or thermocouple sensor at the TEMP connector and transmit this value over the APL connector with a functional safe protocol.
Safe State (Assumption),There are two possible safe states:
,a) The safe bus communication over APL with the Hockey Puck is not possible anymore.
,b) The Hockey Puck is indicating an internal error over the safe bus protocol and mark the transmitted temperature measurement as faulty.
Targets of safety parameter according to IEC-61508,PFD (percentage) of SIL2 ? 35% of 10^-2
,PFD (avg) ? 3.5 x 10^-3
,Circuit parts with type-B components:
,HFT=0 ? SFF ? 90%
Timing ,Proof test interval ? 12 months
,Safe reaction time ? 1s
,Max. internal diagnosis time ? 8h
,Low demand mode
