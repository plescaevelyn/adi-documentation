Hardware User Guide
===================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL` design incorporates the :adi:`ADE9113`
3-Channel, Isolated, Sigma Delta (Σ-Δ) ADC and the :adi:`MAX32655`
low-power, Arm Cortex-M4 processor with FPU-Based microcontroller
and Bluetooth 5.2 allowing the implementation of type 2 EVSE charging cables.
The :adi:`ADE9113` has two voltage measurement channels and a current measurement
one used to implement the safety functions in the firmware. The integrated isolation
makes the connection with the :adi:`MAX32655` straightforward. The communication
between the two components is implemented over SPI.

The control pilot (CP) signal needed for implementing the communication between
the EVSE and EV is generated using the :adi:`MAX32655` and the :adi:`ADA4523-1`
Low Noise, Zero Drift Op Amp.

The system is powered from the single phase 230V AC input. An isolated AC-DC
SMPS is used to deliver 12V to the board and the :adi:`MAX20457`
high-efficiency dual synchronous buck converters for automotive applications
are used to step down the voltage to 5V and 3.3V providing power to the
isolated side of the board. The :adi:`LT8330` used in the inverting
configuration generates the 12V negative voltage needed for the low side of the
CP signal.

The :adi:`MAX32655` exposes all the necessary debug and programming
features enabling a complete software development experience. The Bluetooth 5.2
LE radio with the available fully open-source Bluetooth 5.2 stack makes it easy
to develop an interaction method between the user and the board. Four user
buttons and 4 LEDs are also provided to complete the user interface. Serial
communication (RS-232) is used for sending debug messages during testing or
development.

The :adi:`ADT75` 12-Bit digital temperature sensor monitors the
temperature of the device and sends it to the MCU unit for implementing
overtemperature protection.

The main components used in the design are highlighted in the following figures.

Setting up the board
--------------------

To power up the board, connect the ``grid connector`` to a single-phase 230V AC line.
A 3-wire cable rated at 16A is the minimum acceptable. The output can be connected to
an EVSE test adapter, a type 2 cable (and EV), or left disconnected for first time power-up
or programming. The program/debug connector, which is a 10-pin ARM Cortex debug connector,
must be connected to a programmer, such as the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` MAXDAP DAPLink programmer
based on the :adi:`MAX32625`, using a cable if a firmware update is required. The MAXDAP can
also be used to read debug messages during development. Messages are sent via RS-232.
The UART device ID is 0, with the following settings: 57600 baud, 8 data bits,
no parity, 1 stop bit (57600 8N1).

The following figures show the messages received on a computer connected to the board
through the MAXDAP, with the debug print option enabled.

After the self-test finishes, a charging session can be initiated by the EV or
the device connected to the ``EV connector``. The following images present the
debug messages received during a charging session.

User Interface
---------------

Three programable push buttons, one MCU reset button and four LEDs, are available
for user interface.

    Programmable Push Buttons

The buttons and LEDs are connected to the MCU as shown in the image above.
The LEDs indicate the current state of the EVSE or display the type of error
if one is detected.

    LEDs on the Rev D board

    during state C if the LED blinks fast then the current is set at 16A,
    if it blinks slow it is limited to 10A

Test Points
------------

For evaluation and debugging purpose, test points are provided at every
important point on the PCB. The names of the test points are printed on the
silkscreen.

Scope Images
-------------

**CP signal values corelated to the EVSE states**

The CP signal is shown for each state (A, B, C, D, and diode error) in the
following images, measured at two different points on the board. The first image
for each case shows the value measured at the CP test point highlighted in
the following image, and the second shows the value at the CP_READ test point,
which corresponds to the MCU ADC input.
