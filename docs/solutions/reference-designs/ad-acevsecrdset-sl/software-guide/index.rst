easy integration with standard EV systems.

The :adi:`AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL <ad-bct2ade9113-sl.html>` is designed to meet
IEC61851 and IEC62752 standards and includes a Type A residual current device
(RCD) and a control pilot circuit.


The no-OS Framework and the Drivers for the Main Components
-----------------------------------------------------------

no-OS General Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:git-no-OS:`/` is a software framework by :adi:`Analog Devices Inc <index>`
for systems that don’t include an operating system (OS), otherwise known as baremetal.
This framework defines a :dokuwiki+deprecated:`common interface (API) </resources/no-os/api>`
for accessing typical baremetal peripherals such as GPIO, SPI, I2C, RTC, Timer,
Interrupt Controller, and other. This common API may be then used to initialize
and control these peripherals in a common way across multiple microcontroller platforms.

The framework currently supports Intel and Xilinx microprocessors and SoC's as well as
Analog Devices' own precision microcontrollers, several Maxim MAX32xxx microcontrollers,
STMicroelectronics' STM32, Raspberry Pi's Pico, and mbed-OS-based devices. By using this
common driver API, following its own
:git-no-OS:`coding style <wiki/Code-Style-guidelines+>`,
the :git-no-OS:`/` is able to provide reference projects for
Analog Devices evaluation boards running on various underlying hardware.

Thanks to the :external+no-OS:doc:`build_guide`,
no-OS users may generate standalone reference projects in a short period of time and
use them as the starting point for their own development. no-OS is an open-source
software, and its official repository is the
:git-no-OS:`no-OS GitHub Repository </>`.

Users are free to use and distribute no-OS, provided that they comply with the
:git-no-OS:`license <LICENSE>`.
The no-OS main drivers used in the firmware are the ones concerned with the
:adi:`MAX32655` microcontroller, the :adi:`ADE7913` isolated, 3-channel Σ-Δ ADC,
and the :adi:`ADT75` temperature monitoring system.

no-OS Support for Maxim Microcontrollers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The no-OS framework supports several Maxim microcontrollers, including the
:adi:`MAX32655`, and implements the low-level functions for controlling the
hardware components of the device: GPIO, UART, NVIC, I2C, and SPI.
The :external+no-OS:doc:`build_guide`
provides the steps required for creating and building an application based
on a supported Maxim microcontroller part.

ADE7913 no-OS driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The existing no-OS driver for the :adi:`ADE7913` ADC implements the
functionalities provided by the device through a comprehensive high-level API.
All the settings of the :adi:`ADE7913` ADC are accessed through separate
functions that perform SPI read and write operations on the corresponding
device registers. The driver provides the possibility of reading
the acquired data at moments in time specified by the application or depending
on the state of the Data Ready pin through an interrupt. Using the device
requires populating the initialization parameters structure, calling the
``ade7913_init`` API and then reading the i_wav, v1_wav, and v2_wav members of the
device structure. Depending on the desired settings, these members are updated
through an interrupt triggered by the Data Ready pin or each time a long SPI
read operation is performed on one of the device’s registers.

.. code:: C

   // ADE7913 initialization structure
   struct ade7913_init_param ade7913_ip = { 0 };

   // ADE7913 dev SPI init params
   ade7913_ip.spi_init = &ade7913_spi_ip;
   // ADE7913 dev DATA_RDY init params
   ade7913_ip.gpio_rdy = &ade7913_gpio_rdy_ip;
   // ADE7913 dev RESET init params
   ade7913_ip.gpio_reset = &ade7913_gpio_reset_ip;
   // IRQ deviuce descriptor used to handle interrupt routine for GPIO RDY
   ade7913_ip.irq_ctrl = ade7913_irq_desc;

   // ADE7913 device initialization
   ret = ade7913_init(device, ade7913_ip);

   // Data updated automatically in the  i_wav, v1_wav, and v2_wav members of the device structure

ADT75 no-OS driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

no-OS support for the :adi:`ADT75` provides an easy and straight-forward way
of obtaining temperature readings from the device. Using the device implies
the specification of the SPI communication parameters, the call of the
``adt75_init`` function for initialization, and the ``adt75_get_single_temp``
API for getting the current temperature value.

.. code:: C

   //ADT75 initialization structure
   struct adt75_init_param adt75_ip = {
       .comm_param = i2c_param,
   };

   // ADT75 device initialization
   ret = adt75_init(&adt75_desc, &adt75_ip);

   // ADT75 single temperature reading
   ret = adt75_get_single_temp(adt75_desc, &val);

Flashing and Debugging the Firmware for the AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL using the MAX32625PICO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- MAX32625PICO Board
- AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL board
- AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL.hex file
- USB-to-micro USB cable
- 10-pin Cortex Debug Cable
- 3-wire cable with mains plug attached
- Serial terminal

The binary can be obtained following the steps presented at the
:external+no-OS:doc:`build_guide`

STEP 1 — MAX32625PICO firmware update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Download the MAX32655FTHR Firmware image from
    `here <https://github.com/MaximIntegrated/max32625pico-firmware-images/>`__.

-   Follow the procedure indicated
    `here <https://github.com/MaximIntegrated/max32625pico-firmware-images/#how-to-update-the-firmware>`__
    to load the new firmware.

STEP 2 — Connecting MAX32625PICO to AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect the Cortex Debug Cable to the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` with the
connector key directed towards the outside of the board and to the
:adi:`AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL <ad-bct2ade9113-sl>` board directed downwards.

STEP 3 — Connecting AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL to Mains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Connect the NULL, PHASE, and Earth as indicated on the enclosure.
- Power up the board from 230V AC through the attached cable.

STEP 4 — Flashing the Firmware to the board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Connect the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` if it is not connected to the PC USB port.
    The DAPLINK Drive should appear as a storage device on the PC.
-   Open the DAPLINK Drive. Two files should already be present as seen in the following
    image.

        .. figure:: ad-acevsecrdset-sl_soft2.jpg

-   Drag and drop the AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL.hex into DAPLINK drive.
-   The firmware will be written on the target MCU.

STEP 5 — Verify that the firmware is written correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Open Device Manager and go to **Ports**. Find the COM port allocated to the
    :adi:`MAX32625PICO`.
-   Use a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY) to verify that the firmware was correctly
    updated. If using PuTTY, under the Terminal menu, select **“Implicit CR in every LF”**.
-   From the Window menu, increase the **Lines of scrollback** value to a higher number
    (e.g., 200000) than the default.
-   Open PuTTY and, under the **Session** menu, enter the following data: the **COM port**
    indicated in Device Manager for the device and a baud rate of **57600**.
-   Click the Open button. After the terminal window opens, reset the
    :adi:`AD-ACEVSECRDSET-SL <ad-bct2ade9113-sl>` board using the reset button.

The following messages should be displayed in the serial terminal window:

**Revision A**
