EVAL-CN0385-FMCZ
=================

Isolated Multichannel Data Acquisition System.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0385` is an isolated multichannel data acquisition system that is
compatible with standard industrial signal levels. The components are
specifically selected to optimize settling time between samples, providing
18-bit performance at channel switching rates up to roughly 750 kHz.

The CN0385 can process eight gain-independent channels and is compatible with
both single-ended and differential input signals. The analog front end includes
the :adi:`ADG5207` multiplexer, the :adi:`AD8251` programmable gain
instrumentation amplifier (PGIA), the :adi:`AD8475` as a precision ADC driver
for performing the single-ended-to-differential conversion, and the
:adi:`AD4003`, an 18-bit, 2 MSPS Precision ADC. Gain configurations of 0.4,
0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 are available.

   Simplified circuit schematic

The maximum sample rate of the system is 2 MSPS in Turbo Mode for single
channel continuous sampling. The channel switching logic is synchronous to the
ADC conversions, and the maximum channel switching rate is 1.5 MHz. Channel
switching rates up to 100 kHz also provide 18-bit performance.

Using the Evaluation Software
------------------------------

Software Control and Indicator Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: cn0385_12_configtab.png
   :align: center

   Configuration tab

- **External REF (V)** -- Determines the value of the reference voltage used in
  calculations and analysis by the software. Affects aspects of the Waveform and
  Histogram plots (i.e. volt axis values, LSB-to-voltage conversions, etc.).
  Should be set to the value of the reference voltage used on the
  EVAL-CN0385-FMCZ Board (4.096 V by default).
- **Throughput Rate** -- Sets the sample rate of the :adi:`AD4003` (in KSPS).
  Note: the effective sample rate for each channel in the sequence (in KSPS) is
  equal to the value in Sample Rate divided by the number (1, 2, 4, or 8) of
  channels in the sequence.
- **ADC Register Setting** -- Set or clear the :adi:`AD4003` register control
  bits by clicking the corresponding button.

  OVP bit, and show them in the following LEDs on the right. "1" turns the LEDs
  on, and "0" turns the LEDs off.
- **ADC Control and Status LEDs** -- After Read ADC Register, the control and
  status bits are assigned to the following LEDs on the right. "1" turns the LEDs
  on, and "0" turns the LEDs off.
- **MUXSequencerEN** -- Set to ON to enable sequence mode, and set to OFF to
  disable sequence mode and use MUX Channel to select the target channel to
  sample.

Establishing a USB Connection Link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Verify that the SDP drivers are properly installed (see **Installing the
   Software**).
#. Ensure that the CN0385 Evaluation Hardware and the SDP-H1 Controller Board
   are correctly connected and powered up.
#. Run the `CN0385 Evaluation Software <https://www.analog.com/CN0385>`__
   (**CN0385.exe**).
#. If the CN0385 Evaluation Hardware is properly connected to the PC, the
   evaluation software will automatically establish a connection with the SDP-H1
   Controller Board.
#. If the software does not detect the CN0385 Evaluation Hardware, a pop-up will
   appear with options to reattempt the connection. Selecting **Rescan** will
   attempt to establish the USB connection again.

Configuring a Conversion Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configurations are defined in the Configuration tab. In normal mode the max
sampling rate is 1.5 MSPS. Only when Turbo Mode is enabled, the sampling rate
can go up to 2 MSPS. Turn MUXSequencerEN ON to enable the sequencer for
multi-channel sampling. In the sequencer mode, it can only convert in sequence
from channel 1 to the last channel defined by MUX Channel.

Capturing Samples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the configuration is done and the CN0385 Evaluation Hardware and Software
are connected, the software can initiate conversions. To capture samples:

#. Ensure that the value in **VREF** matches the reference voltage being used on
   the CN0385 Evaluation Hardware. Note that the Sample Rate is the sample rate
   of the :adi:`AD4003`, not the effective sample rate for each channel.
#. Select the desired **Sample Rate** and **SCK** rate.

   - Note that the **Sample Rate** is the sample rate of the ADC, not the
     effective sample rate for each channel.

#. Press either **Single Capture** to perform a single burst of sampling
   sequences or **Continuous Capture** to perform repeated bursts of sampling
   sequences until stopped.

Viewing Conversion Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After capturing samples or loading a previous set of conversion results, the
data and analysis items for each channel can be viewed using the **Waveform**
tab, the **Histogram** tab, the **FFT** tab and the **Summary** tab.

#. Select the **Multi-Channel** tab to view every channel's data on a single
   plot. The **Multi-Channel Selectors** set the visibility of each channel's
   data.

   results in non-sequencer mode. The **Histogram** and **FFT** sub-tabs show
   the dc and ac analysis.
