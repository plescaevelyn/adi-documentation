User Guide
===============================================================================

The :adi:`EVAL-AD5758SDZ` is a full-featured evaluation board for the
:adi:`AD5758`, a single-channel, 16-bit, voltage and current output
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with on-chip dynamic power control (DPC),
integrated fault diagnostics, and HART connectivity. The board carries an
on-board 2.5 V ADR4525 reference and an ADP1031-1 isolated power management
unit (PMU) with integrated SPI signal isolation.

   EVAL-AD5758SDZ

The complete hardware description of the evaluation board, including the full
link/jumper option tables, schematics, and bill of materials, is documented in
the `EVAL-AD5758 User Guide (UG-1268)
<https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad5758-ug-1268.pdf>`_.
This page focuses on evaluating the board with a ZedBoard FPGA carrier using
the HDL reference design and No-OS, which is the setup recommended in this
documentation.

.. note::

   The EVAL-AD5758SDZ can be evaluated in two ways:

   - With an FPGA carrier (ZedBoard) using the :git-hdl:`HDL reference design
     <projects/ad5758_sdz>` and Linux/no-OS software. **This is the platform
     covered here.**
   - With the EVAL-SDP-CS1Z (SDP-S) controller board and the ACE software on a
     PC, as described in `UG-1268
     <https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad5758-ug-1268.pdf>`_.
     Refer to `UG-1268
     <https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad5758-ug-1268.pdf>`_ 
     for that flow.

The FPGA carrier is programmed with the AD5758 HDL reference design. For the
supported carrier (ZedBoard), the required jumper settings, the block diagram,
and the build instructions, refer to the
:external+hdl:ref:`AD5758-SDZ HDL reference design documentation <ad5758_sdz>`.

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AD5758 operates with a power supply range from −33 V on AVSS to +33 V on
AVDD1, with a maximum of 60 V between the two rails. Its key features include:

- Single-channel, 16-bit resolution
- Programmable voltage outputs (0 V to 5 V, 0 V to 10 V, ±5 V, ±10 V) and
  current outputs (0 mA to 20 mA, 0 mA to 24 mA, 4 mA to 24 mA, ±20 mA,
  ±24 mA)
- On-chip dynamic power control (DPC) using a buck dc-to-dc converter to
  minimize package power dissipation
- Integrated 12-bit diagnostic ADC and fault-protection switches
- SPI interface with CRC and watchdog timer
- HART signal coupling via the CHART pin

Applications include industrial process control, actuator and valve control,
programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and HART network connectivity.

Hardware configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The evaluation board ships with a set of link (jumper) options that are
preconfigured to sensible defaults. For the full list of links (JP1 to JP13,
P10, and S2) and their functions, see Table 1 of `UG-1268
<https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/user-guides/eval-ad5758-ug-1268.pdf>`_.

When using the board with the ZedBoard and the HDL reference design, confirm
the following default link positions:

       AD5758 REFOUT pin).
   - - JP11
     - Inserted
     - Selects the 3.3 V VLDO output as the source for the VLOGIC input.

.. danger::

   The EVAL-AD5758SDZ can operate at high voltages (up to 60 V between the
   AVDD1 and AVSS rails). Take appropriate care when powering and probing the
   board.

Power supply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The on-board ADP1031-1 PMU generates three of the four supplies required by
the AD5758 from a single bench-top input: AVDD1 (+26.7 V), AVDD2 (+5.15 V),
and AVSS (−15.4 V). The fourth supply, VLOGIC (3.3 V), is provided from the
AD5758 VLDO output through the JP11 link.

Apply the bench-top power supply and connector cables per UG-1268. AVDD2
requires a voltage between 5 V and 33 V; the full AVSS/AVDD1 range is −33 V to
+33 V with a 60 V maximum between rails.

Serial communication and control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the board is used with the ZedBoard, the FPGA drives the SPI interface
(SCLK, SDI, SDO, SYNC) and the RESET, LDAC, and FAULT signals of the AD5758
through the EVAL-SDP-CK1Z (FMC-I-SDP) interposer and the FMC LPC connector.
The P10 link and the S2 link allow the digital signals to be disconnected from
the controller and driven from an external source; leave them in their default
positions for standard operation.

Schematic, PCB Layout, Bill of Materials

Design support files for the :adi:`EVAL-AD5758SDZ` evaluation board,
including schematics, PCB layout, and bill of materials, are available on the
:adi:`AD5758` product page. Refer to the

for the full evaluation board user guide.

Getting started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To evaluate the board with the ZedBoard:

#. Verify the link (jumper) settings as described in the
   :ref:`Hardware configuration <eval_ad5758 user-guide>` section above.
#. Prepare the SD card with the HDL reference design and no-OS software, as
   described in the :ref:`quick start guide <eval_ad5758 quickstart zed>`.
#. With the ZedBoard powered off, insert the prepared SD card, plug the
   EVAL-SDP-CK1Z (FMC-I-SDP) interposer into the ZedBoard FMC LPC connector,
   and mount the EVAL-AD5758SDZ onto the interposer.
#. Connect a 24 V bench-top supply to the PVIN connector, but keep the supply
   output turned off for now.
#. Power on the ZedBoard using its own power supply, then turn on the 24 V
   supply to the EVAL-AD5758SDZ.
#. Use the no-OS application to control the DAC output.

For the step-by-step carrier setup, see the
:ref:`ZedBoard quick start guide <eval_ad5758 quickstart zed>`.
