3. Install the latest version of the CrossCore Serial Flash Programmer
   from Analog.com. You can skip this step if you have the latest version
   already installed.

   1. Set Target to "ADuCM302x".
   2. Select firmware file "adi5758_20180910.hex" in the <File to

      in steps 1 & 2.)
   3. Apply 24 V to the "24 V SYS" connector
   4. Plug the USB cable into the demo board.
   5. Hold down S2 (Boot) button while briefly pressing the S1 (Reset)
