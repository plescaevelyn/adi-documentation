   EVAL-CN0568-ARDZ evaluation board.

The evaluation board mounts to the Arduino header of the SDP-K1 controller
board.

- **J1** -- +5 V power connection (set current limit to 200 mA)
- **V+SMA** -- +25 V connection (set current limit to 20 mA)
- **RFOUT** -- 50 Ohm 2.92 mm RF output to spectrum analyzer

Software Installation
---------------------

#. Download the software folder from the :adi:`CN0568` product page.
#. Double-click on the ``CN0548.exe`` self-extracting installer to start the
   installation process.
#. Follow the installation windows that appear to install the software in the
   default location.

      Installation complete.

#. After the CN0568 software has been installed, an installation window for the
   SDP drivers will appear. If the SDP drivers have not previously been
   installed on the machine, proceed with this installation step.

      :width: 400px

      SDP drivers installation window.

#. Load the custom firmware to the SDP-K1 board by dragging and dropping the
   ``SDP_K1_release.hex`` file (contained within the software download folder)
   to the SDP-K1 drive listed in the Devices and Drives of "This PC" within
   Windows Explorer. This step only needs to be done once as the image remains
   on the board after removal of the USB cable.

Software Interface
------------------

The interface used to control the circuit has three regions:

#. **Graphical control region** -- Contains all the buttons and numeric
   controls used to program the :adi:`ADF41513`.
#. **Register region** -- If anything is changed in the graphical control
   region, a register is highlighted in green. This indicates to the user that
   the register must be written by pressing the corresponding **Write
   Register** button. Some controls have a dedicated button to update the
   register directly.
#. **Log window** -- Shows the most recent transactions to the user. A log can
   be saved of all activity in a session.

   regions.

Device Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The device connection tab is displayed first after executing the software
interface. From here, the user selects the device variant and the device
configuration (single board or multi-board). After these are selected, press
the **Connect** button to establish a connection.

Main Controls Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reference Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section contains the controls associated with the reference frequency.

**Reference Source**
   By default, the board is configured to use the 100 MHz on-board reference
   crystal oscillator. If a different frequency external reference is used,
   change this control accordingly.

**Reference Frequency**
   This can only be changed if an external reference frequency is used. This
   value must match the external frequency applied.

**Divider and Doubler**
   These can be used to change the PFD frequency accordingly on the
   :adi:`ADF41513`.

Frequency Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the frequency control section, the VCO output frequency can be programmed by
inputting the desired frequency in MHz. After inputting the frequency, press the
**Update Frequency** button to update.

Phase Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The phase of an output signal can be incremented by specifying the value in the
Phase Value field. The phase is calculated and can be updated by pressing the
**Increment Phase** button.

Phase resync is enabled by default within the initialization sequence. To set
the phase resync time, set the CLK1 and CLK2 multipliers accordingly.

.. note::

   The phase resync time must be greater than the worst case lock time.

Hop Function Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A frequency hop can be performed continuously between 2 frequencies within the
Hop Function tab. **VCO Freq. A** and **VCO Freq. B** are the two frequencies
that the user specifies for the hop. The dwell time at each frequency is input
in the **Time Delay** field. A frequency hop is started by pressing the
**Start** button and stopped using the **Stop** button.

.. figure:: hopfunction.png

   Hop Function tab interface.

Dual Board Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dual board configuration can be used when two boards of the same VCO variant
are connected via a stacked connection from the Arduino-style header. This must
first be selected in the Board Configuration section prior to establishing a
software connection. When using the dual board configuration, the user can
select which board is being controlled through SPI writes using the **Board
Select** drop-down box on the upper right within the Main Controls tab.

.. figure:: boardselect.png

   Board Select drop-down for dual board configuration.

To use the dual board configuration, one of the boards needs to be
reconfigured to receive SPI on a different LE signal line. To do this, remove
**R41** on the upper board of the stack and install **R42** instead.

Other Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the basic register controls of the :adi:`ADF41513` have been included
in the Other Functions tab of the software interface. These controls are related
to lock detect settings, PLL settings, and the MUXOUT signal. For information
about the functionality of each control, refer to registers 5, 6, 7, and 12 in
the register map section of the :adi:`ADF41513` data sheet.

Evaluation Procedure
---------------------

.. figure:: setup_circuit_note1.jpg

   EVAL-CN0568-ARDZ evaluation setup.

#. Download and install the :adi:`CN0568` board software from the product page.
#. Set up the evaluation board with:

   - +5 V connected to **J1** and +25 V connected to **V+SMA** of the DC
     power supply (ensuring supply outputs are switched off).
   - Set current limit of +5 V supply to 200 mA and set current limit of
     +25 V supply to 20 mA.
   - Evaluation board mounted to the Arduino header of the SDP-K1.
   - USB cable connected to the host PC from the SDP-K1 board.
   - 50 Ohm 2.92 mm RF cable connected from **RFOUT** of the evaluation board
     to RFIN of the spectrum analyzer.

#. Open the software and select the relevant part/board variant.
#. Turn on the +5 V power supply, then turn on the +25 V power supply.
#. Press the **Write Initialization Sequence** button to initialize the part.

   - The current drawn on the +5 V supply should be between 150--180 mA.
   - The current drawn on the +25 V supply should be approximately 4 mA.

#. In the spectrum analyzer instrument, set up a phase noise measurement.
#. Input the first test frequency for the variant used in the **VCO Out** box
   and press **Update Frequency**.

   .. figure:: updatefrequency.png

      Update Frequency control in the software interface.

#. Wait until the instrument locks to the output frequency and displays the
   phase noise profile on screen. Note the phase noise at offsets of 100 kHz,
   1 MHz, and 10 MHz.
#. Repeat steps 7--8 for each test frequency listed in the :adi:`CN0568`
   circuit note for the board variant being tested.
