EVAL-CN0178-SDPZ
=================

Wideband True RMS RF Power Detector (50 MHz to 9 GHz).

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0178 <CN0178>` is a circuit that measures the rms signal strength of
RF signals with varying crest factors (peak-to-average ratio) over a dynamic
range of approximately 65 dB and operates at frequencies from 50 MHz up to
9 GHz using the :adi:`ADL5902` TruPwr detector. The measurement result is
provided as serial data at the output of a 12-bit ADC. A simple 4-point system
calibration at ambient temperature is performed in the digital domain.

The :adi:`ADL5902` provides a solution in a variety of high frequency systems
requiring an accurate measurement of signal power. It can operate from 50 MHz
to 9 GHz and can accept inputs from -62 dBm to at least +3 dBm with large
crest factors, such as GSM, CDMA, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, WiMAX, and LTE modulated
signals.

The :adi:`AD7466` is a 12-bit, high speed, low power, successive approximation
ADC. It operates from a single 1.6 V to 3.6 V power supply and features
throughput rates up to 200 kSPS with low power dissipation. It contains a low
noise, wide bandwidth track-and-hold amplifier which can handle input
frequencies in excess of 3 MHz.

The EVAL-CN0178-SDPZ board connects to ADI's System Demonstration Platform
(SDP) and is powered by a +6 V supply or +6 V wall wart.

General Setup
-------------

Block Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   CN0178 system block diagram

- The EVAL-CN0178-SDPZ (CN0178 Board) connects to the :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CB1Z`
  (SDP-B Board) via the 120-pin connector.
- The SDP-B Board connects to the PC via the USB cable.
- Terminal block **J1** is the +6 V power supply input.
- Terminal block **J2** is the +6 V barrel connector for wall wart supply.
- **J3** is the SMA connector for RF input.

Test Setup
~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: cn0178_test_setup.png

   CN0178 test setup

#. Connect the 120-pin connector on the EVAL-CN0178-SDPZ to the connector
   marked "CON A" on the :adi:`EVAL-SDP-CB1Z`.
#. Connect the RF signal source to the EVAL-CN0178-SDPZ via the SMA RF input
   connector.
#. With power to the supply off, connect a +6 V power supply to the pins
   marked "+6V" and "GND" on the board. Alternatively, a +6 V wall wart can
   be connected to the barrel connector.
#. Connect the USB cable supplied with the SDP board to the USB port on the PC.
#. Apply power to the +6 V supply (or wall wart).
#. Launch the evaluation software.
#. Connect the USB cable from the PC to the USB mini connector on the SDP
   board.

.. important::

   Do **not** connect the USB cable to the Mini-USB connector on the SDP board
   before turning on the dc power supply for the EVAL-CN0178-SDPZ.

Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the slope and intercept of the system vary from device to device, a
system level calibration is **required**. For this board, a 4-point calibration
is used to correct for some non-linearity in the RF detector's transfer
function, particularly at the low end.

#. Apply four known signal levels to the ADL5902. These should be well within
   the linear operating range of the device.

   .. figure:: cn0178_transfer_function.png
      :align: center

      ADL5902 RF detector transfer function

#. Measure the corresponding output codes from the ADC.
#. Calculate SLOPE and INTERCEPT calibration coefficients using the following
   equations:

   - **SLOPE_1** = (CODE_1 - CODE_2) / (PIN_1 - PIN_2)
   - **INTERCEPT_1** = CODE_1 / (SLOPE_ADC / PIN_1)

#. This calculation is repeated using CODE_2/CODE_3 and CODE_3/CODE_4 to
   calculate SLOPE_2/INTERCEPT_2 and SLOPE_3/INTERCEPT_3 respectively.
#. These are used to calculate the unknown input power level:

   - **PIN** = (CODE / SLOPE) + INTERCEPT

#. The observed code from the ADC is compared to the calibration coefficient
   codes to retrieve the appropriate SLOPE and INTERCEPT. For example, if CODE
   from the ADC is between CODE_1 and CODE_2, then SLOPE_1/INTERCEPT_1 should
   be used.

Installing the Evaluation Software
-----------------------------------

#. Extract the file **CN0178_Evaluation_Software.zip** and open **setup.exe**.

   .. note::

      It is recommended to install the CN0178 Evaluation Software to the
      default path ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Analog Devices\CN0178\`` and all
      National Instruments products to ``C:\Program Files\National Instruments\``.
