FMComms5 Plugin Description
===========================

.. |more| replace:: *(see AD9361 linux driver documentation)*

The FMCOMMS5 plugin works with the
`IIO Oscilloscope <https://wiki.analog.com/iio_oscilloscope>`_. You always
use the latest version if possible. Changing any field will immediately write
changes which have been made to the FMComms5 settings to the hardware, and
then read it back to make sure the setting is valid. If you want to set
something that the GUI changes to a different number, that either means that
GUI is rounding (sorry), or the hardware (either the AD9361 or the FPGA
fabric) does not support that mode/precision.

.. note::

   For the main OSC plot window: The allowed channel sections are based on
   following rules:


   -  Channels need to enabled pairwise I & Q. (example voltage0 & voltage1
      or voltage2 & voltage3, etc. )
   -  The number of enabled pairwise channels need to be equal between the
      two devices.
   -  Devices are split as following: voltage0..3 Device A,
      voltage4..7 Device B


If you want to go play with ``/sys/bus/iio/devices/....`` and manipulate the
devices behind the back of the GUI, it's still possible to see the settings
by clicking the "refresh" button at the bottom of the GUI.

If you think the device has a setting that isn't managed by this tab, check
out the `fmcomms5 Advanced Plugin`_ for the IIO Oscilloscope.

The FMComms5 view is divided in four sections:

-  **Device Global Settings**
-  **Receive Chain**
-  **Transmit Chain**
-  **FPGA Settings**

Note that all settings above apply to both ad9361 devices.

Receive Chain

   70MHz to 6GHz with 1Hz tuning granularity. |more|
-  **Fastlock Mode** |more|

   -  **Fastlock Profile:** Selects a profile to be stored or recalled.
   -  **Store:** Stores the selected profile.
   -  **Recall:** Recalls the selected profile.

-  **Tracking** |more|

   -  **Quadrature**
   -  **RF DC**
   -  **BB DC**

-  **RX**

   -  **Hardware Gain(dB):** Controls the RX gain only in Manual Gain
      Control Mode (MGC). |more|
   -  **RSSI(dB):** Displays the received strength signal level. |more|
   -  **Gain Control:** Displays the active gain mode. |more|
   -  **Gain Control Modes:** Selects one of the available modes: manual,
      slow_attack, hybrid and fast_attack. |more|

Note that only **RF Bandwidth**, **Sampling Rate**, **RF Port Select** and
