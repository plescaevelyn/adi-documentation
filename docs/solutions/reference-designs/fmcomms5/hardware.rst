      ERRATA:

         The FMCOMMS5, REV B has a bug in it, that doesn't allow the ADF5355 to
         function properly. (Pin 5, AVDD is a floating node). It's a simple fix
         - short pin 5 (AVDD) with pin 4 (CE) to make a connection to
         VDD_EXT_LO_3P3.

I/O Voltage
-----------

The :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS5-EBZ` (AD9361) assumes a VDD_INTERFACE voltage between
1.71V and 2.625V (1.8 to 2.5 +/- 5%), so on your FPGA carrier board, you should
ensure that V\ :sub:`ADJ` is between these levels. Setting things to 3.3V will
damage the part.

Phase Synchronization
---------------------

Traces between baluns and SMAs are not phase-matched on REV-A and REV-B which
can cause phase misalignment with the libad9361-iio ad9361_fmcomms5_phase_sync
solution. This is corrected on REV-C. Therefore, phase alignment performance can
vary over frequency. The RF switches on REV-A/B are also not designed to work
above 900 MHz. Higher frequency switches are available on REV-C.

Below are some preliminary results using Release 2018-R1 with equal length but
unmatched cables
