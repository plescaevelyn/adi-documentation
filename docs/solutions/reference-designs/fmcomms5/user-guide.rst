User Guide
===============================================================================

The :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS5-EBZ <AD-FMCOMMS5-EBZ>` carries two
:adi:`AD9361` transceivers, providing four receive and four transmit
channels on a single FMC card. This user guide explains the board
hardware, the IIO Oscilloscope plugin used to control the dual
transceiver pair, and the synchronization and calibration steps
required to operate the two devices as a coherent 4x4 MIMO system.

.. tip::

   If you have not set up your board yet, start with the
   :doc:`prerequisites` and :doc:`quickstart/index` pages first,
   then return here for in-depth configuration.

The pages below follow the typical workflow — from understanding
the hardware, through configuring the RF parameters, to
synchronizing and phase-aligning the two AD9361 devices:

- :doc:`hardware` — schematics, PCB layout, bill of materials, and
  configuration options for the AD-FMCOMMS5-EBZ board.
- :doc:`fmcomms5_plugin` — overview of the FMCOMMS5 plugin for the
  IIO Oscilloscope, including channel configuration rules and
  control of the dual :adi:`AD9361` transceiver pair.
- :doc:`multi-chip-sync` — explains how baseband sampling and data
  clocks are synchronized across the two AD9361 devices, and the
  RF synchronization limitations that motivate phase calibration.
- :doc:`phase-sync` — describes the phase synchronization
  calibration procedure and how it is implemented in IIO
  Oscilloscope and ``libad9361``.
