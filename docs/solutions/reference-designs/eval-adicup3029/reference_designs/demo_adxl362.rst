General Description/Overview
----------------------------

The ADuCM3029_demo_esp8266 project uses the `EVAL-ADXL362-ARDZ shield <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup360/hardware/adxl362>`_ which has an **ADXL362 3-axis MEMS accelerometer** and a incorporated **NHD-C12832A1Z-NSW-BBW display** (128x32). However, for this example the display is not used.

The **EVAL-ADICUP3029** is designed for IOT (Internet of Things) applications in mind, and therefore comes with on board Wi-Fi **ESP8266** module.

Also, in order to fully make use of the IOT capability, **MQTT** messaging protocol is used as it is extremely simple and lightweight.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

The following is a list of items needed in order to replicate this demo.

-  Hardware

   -  EVAL-ADICUP3029
   -  EVAL-ADXL362-ARDZ
   -  Mirco USB to USB cable
   -  PC or Laptop with a USB port

-  Software

   -  ADuCM3029_demo_adxl362 software
   -  CrossCore Embedded Studio (2.6.0 or higher)
   -  ADuCM302x DFP (2.0.0 or higher)
   -  ADICUP3029 BSP (1.1.0 or higher)
   -  Mosquitto Broker

Setting up the Hardware
-----------------------

-  Move the **S2 switch** to the **WiFi** position on the **EVAL-ADICUP3029**.

.. image:: ../images/adicup3029_switch.png
   :align: center

-  The ESP8266 Enable Pin needs to be tied directly to 3.3V or pulled high to
   the GPIO via a 10K ohm resistor. Because this is not currently on the Rev B
   or Rev C version of the ADICUP3029, you will need to solder a small fly wire
   from the 3.3V pin to the enable pin.

   \* Plug the **ESP8266** in the **P1** connector on the **EVAL-ADICUP3029**.
-  Plug the **EVAL-ADXL362-ARDZ** shield in the **EVAL-ADICUP3029** base board.

-  Plug the USB cable

Obtaining the Software
----------------------

There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the software for the
ESP8266.

-  Dragging and Dropping the .Hex to the Daplink drive
-  Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a version that
Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation purposes. This is the EASIEST
way to get started with the reference design

Importing the project into CrossCore is going to allow you to change parameters
and customize the software to fit your needs, but will be a bit more advanced
and will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

Configuring the Software (parameters.h)
---------------------------------------

-  \*\* Accelerometer scan interval*\* - how often to update sensor information. Set the // SCAN_SENSOR_TIME // parameter (*ADXL362.h*):

::

   #define SCAN_SENSOR_TIME       500      // msecs

-  \*\* Sensor activity and inactivity thresholds*\* - *ACCEL_CFG_ACT_TRESH* and *ACCEL_CFG_INACT_TRESH* paramaters used to determine at which acceleration values the sensor can react at sleep/wake-up commands:

::

   #define ACCEL_CFG_ACT_TRESH    50      // msecs
   #define ACCEL_CFG_INACT_TRESH  50      // msecs

-  \*\* Sensor activity and inactivity time*\* - *ACCEL_CFG_ACT_TIMER* and *ACCEL_CFG_INACT_TIMER* paramaters used to determine sleep/wake-up intervals:

::

   #define ACCEL_CFG_ACT_TIMER   100      // msecs
   #define ACCEL_CFG_INACT_TIMER 10       // msecs

-  **Network parameters** Here you should set your Wi-Fi connection and MQTT information:

::

   #define WIFI_SSID       "***"
   #define WIFI_PASS       "***"
   #define SERVER_ADDR     "***"

Using an MQTT Broker
--------------------

The program connects to a WiFi network and to a TCP MQTT broker. After receiving the *SUBACK* confirmation from the server, the program enters an infinite loop where it waits for an ADXL-362 interrupt which is triggered when the acceleration on any axes is greater than **50 mG**. Afterwards, the program publishes the x, y, z readings on **adxl** topic. A subscriber to this topic can view this information.

Installing the Mosquitto Broker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses the `Eclipse Mosquitto <https://mosquitto.org>`_ which is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. However, the user is free to use his favorite MQTT broker with minimal changes. MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for "Internet of Things" messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers.

.. hint::

   Alternatively, there is an additional step-by-step procedure written which can be used in combination with the steps outlined below. The combination of both procedures should be enough to get most PC/laptops working.\ `Installing and Configuring Mosquitto <https://sivatechworld.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/step-by-step-installing-and-configuring-mosquitto-with-windows-7/>`_

-  `Download mosquitto <https://mosquitto.org/download/>`_
-  Double click the downloaded .exe file, and install the Mosquitto program
-  During the install, Mosquitto will ask you to make sure you have 2 other programs installed.
-  Click the links within the Windows install wizard **BEFORE** completing the Mosquitto install.

   -  `OpenSSL <http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html>`_

      -  `pthreads <https://wiki.analog.com/ftp/sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/dll-latest/dll/x86>`_
      -  Refer to pictures outlined in the additional `step by step instructions. <https://sivatechworld.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/step-by-step-installing-and-configuring-mosquitto-with-windows-7>`_

-  Make sure these additional programs are installed before you continue
-  Click next and finish the installation.

   -  You may run into an issue that says "VCRUNTIME140.dll is missing. In order
      to proceed you must first have this installed.

-  `VCRUNTIME140.DLL Download <http://www.sts-tutorial.com/sites/downloadCenter.php?vcruntime140>`_
-  Re-Run the Mosquitto.exe file, inorder to complete the installation process.

Setting up Mosquitto to Receive MQTT Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  With Mosquitto and other software properly installed, you should be able to run mosquitto. Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where mosquitto is installed. The default location is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\mosquitto
-  Type mosquitto.exe -v to start the broker in verbose mode. Copy this code
   block into your command line editor to navigate to the folder and execute the
   program:<code> cd C:\\Program Files (x86)\\mosquitto\\mosquitto.exe -v
   </code> It should look like the following picture

.. image:: ../images/mosquitto_exe_v.png
   :align: center

.. important::

   Make sure that your computer or laptop is connected to the same network you
   are going to configure in the parameters.h file. Once you run the executable,
   Mosquitto assumes that you are running on that network.

-  The mosquitto broker is now running locally and has the same IP as your machine and by default runs on port 1883. Open a new Command Prompt and type **ipconfig** to get your local IP address
-  In the parameters.h header file you need to configure the following parameters: ``SSID = ""         *Service set identifier, name of the WiFi network to connect the ESP8266*
   PASS = ""         *WiFi network password*
   SERVER_ADDR = ""  *IP of the mosquitto broker from the previous step*
   SERVER_PORT = "1883"     //by default is 1883//``
-  Open a third Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where mosquitto is
   installed and type this command and hit the <ENTER> key:<code> cd C:\\Program
   Files (x86)\\mosquitto\\mosquitto_sub -t adxl </code> This command subscribes
   to the topic and will display the accelerometer data. It should look similar
   to the image below.

.. image:: ../images/adxl_sub.png

Outputting Data
---------------

-  You are now ready to flash the program on the ADICUP3029 and run it. Before downloading the code, please press the **WIFI_RESET** button (**S4**) on the ADICUP3029.
-  If everything works fine, in the CrossCore Embedded Studio console you should
   see:

.. image:: ../images/esp_running_ok.png
   :align: center

-  The program has connected to the local WiFi network, to the TCP mosquitto broker, subscribed to *subtopic* an received *SUBACK* as a confirmation from the broker.
-  The program will publish x, y, z data on the **adxl** topic. In order to view this information, we can use mosquitto_sub and subscribe to the **adxl** topic.
-  At each ADXL362 movement, an interrupt is triggered and as a result, the x, y, z information is published. In the console **publishing sensor reading** message is displayed, while in the mosquitto_sub cmd window you should see the values of x, y, z axis:
