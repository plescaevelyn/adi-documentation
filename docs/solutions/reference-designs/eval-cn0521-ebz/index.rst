EVAL-CN0521-EBZ
===============

USB-Powered, 2.4 GHz RF Low Noise Amplifier Receiver with Overpower Protection Circuit
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0521-EBZ <CN0521>` is a USB-powered, RF low noise amplifier (LNA)
that is optimized for receiving signal chains in the 2.4GHz ISM band.
Using two :adi:`HMC639` amplifiers cascaded together, the design provides
a gain of 21dB and return losses of more than 10dB throughout its RF
band of operation.

The board includes a high speed overpower cutoff that protects sensitive
downstream equipment connected to the receiver system. The receiver system
also automatically turns back on when the RF power level drops within the
acceptable range.

Designed to be used with the :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO`,
the :adi:`EVAL-CN0521-EBZ <CN0521>` features a small form factor, 
with dimensions of 25.4mm×49.6mm×1.5748mm (PCB only). 
The RF input and output are designed with a 50Ω impedance, enabling direct
connection between the circuit and standard 50Ω systems.

A micro-USB connector is used for the input power, allowing the evaluation
board to use most 5V wall wart power supplies available in the market.

   EVAL-CN0521-EBZ Reference Design Board

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0521-EBZ <CN0521>` features the :adi:`HMC639`, which is a GaAs,
pHEMT, high linearity, low noise amplifier operating between 0.2GHz to
4GHz for various applications such as fixed-wireless, cellular, and
CATV. This low noise RF amplifier does not require any external matching
circuitry to operate.

LED Indicators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reference design uses two LEDs to indicate its current status:

============= ==================== ==============================================
RF Port       Reference Designator Description
============= ==================== ==============================================
**Green LED** (DS2)                Indicates that power is present on the board
**Red LED**   (DS1)                Indicates when an overtemperature event
                                   occurs
============= ==================== ==============================================

This table shows the board status when the various LEDs are ON/OFF.

========= ======= ======================================
