Firmware
--------

Installing the Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#.  Connect the microcontroller board (for this example, SDP-K1) to the host PC.
#.  Go to the USB_TO_SPI_FIRMWARE directory and find the latest firmware.
#.  Drag and drop the appropriate firmware file (e.g., ``SDP_K1_PyBMS_USB_TO_SPI_Bytes_Debug_USB_Port.hex`` 
    or ``usb-to-spi-max32690.hex``) onto the corresponding MCUâ€™s USB drive 
    (e.g., SDP USB drive) to update the firmware.

.. tip:: 

   This software setup uses the SDP-K1 as microcontroller board, but users
   may also use the :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL`. In order to flash the firmware image 
   on the :adi:`AD-APARD32690-SL` MCU board, it needs to be connected to 
   the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter board.

**Instructions for flashing firmware image on MAX32625PICO**

#.  Access the `MAX32625PICO Firmware Repository <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images>`__
    and download the image for the specific MCU (e.g., MAX32690).
#.  Do not connect the MAX32625PICO from the PC and the MCU board that you are
    using (e.g., AD-APARDMAX32690-SL, MAX32670 MCU base board).
#.  Plug the micro-USB cable only in the MAX32625PICO.
#.  Press the button on the MAX32625PICO and then plug the other end of the
    micro-USB cable into the PC. (Do not release the button until the MAINTENANCE
    drive is mounted).

       MAX32625PICO Firmware Flasher Button

#. Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
#. Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
#. After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by
   a drive named **DAPLINK**. This indicates that the process is complete, and the
   MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware to the Maxim MCU (e.g.,
   AD-APARD32690-SL, MAX32670 MCU base board) as indicated by Step #3 in
   "Installing the Firmware".

Application Software (GUI)
---------------------------

The EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) that
continuously monitors crucial BMS parameters. This interface facilitates
complete system control, enabling faster prototyping and development.

Launching the Graphical User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To launch the GUI, navigate to the BMS_BROWSER_GUI_BroadMarket_V2.0.0 directory.
#. Double-click the ``BMS_BROWSER_GUI_BroadMarket_V2.0.0.exe`` file.

Custom GUI Configuration
------------------------

The configuration settings in the GUIâ€™s ``config.json`` file
allow users to tailor the software to their specific needs, providing a more
customized and efficient experience.

This section explores the three key settings: ``auto_detect_sdp``, ``limit_usb_polling``, 
and  ``display_user_manual_on_start`` - that users can adjust to better align the 
software to their intended applications.

Key Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

auto_detect_sdp:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Purpose:** Determines whether the software automatically connects to all
  comports or requires manual selection of the NUCLEO comport.
- **Default Setting:** true
- **Modification:**

  - Open the config.json file located in the base directory of the software.
  - Locate the ``auto_detect_sdp`` setting and change its value to false.
  - Save the changes.

limit_usb_polling:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Purpose:** Controls the poll rate of the NUCLEO comport, balancing CPU usage
  and sample rate.
- **Default Setting:** false
- **Modification:**

  - Open the config.json file.
  - Find the ``limit_usb_polling`` setting and change its value to true if a
    reduced poll rate is preferred.
  - Save the changes.

display_user_manual_on_start:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Purpose:** Governs whether the user manual is displayed each time the
  software starts.
- **Default Setting:** true
- **Modification:**

  - Open the config.json file.
  - Locate the ``display_user_manual_on_start`` setting and change its value to
    false if you prefer not to see the manual on startup.
  - Save the changes.

.. tip::

   By adjusting these configuration settings in the config.json file, 
   users can optimize the softwareâ€™s behavior to better suit their requirements. 
   Whether itâ€™s fine-tuning comport connections, managing CPU usage, or controlling 
   the display of the user manual, these settings provide a flexible approach to enhancing 
   the softwareâ€™s usability. Make sure to save your changes and restart the software 
   for the modifications to take effect.
