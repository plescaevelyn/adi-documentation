Overview
--------

The :adi:`CN0590 <CN0590>` is a plug and play USB 2.0 high-speed isolator that
can be used with any modern Type-C device supporting USB 2 connectivity. The
circuit provides a completely isolated connection between a USB 2.0 host and a
USB 2.0 device.

The CN0590 supports fully compatible power and signal isolation up to 2.5 W and
480 Mbps, respectively, as mandated by the USB 2 standard. The system is rated
up to 2.5 kVRMS isolation voltage per UL 1577 and features a system creepage
and clearance of 3.1 mm, limited by the :adi:`ADuM3070`. This system is
suitable for functional isolation or basic and reinforced 300 VRMS CAT II
isolation applications according to IEC 61010 and IEC 62368 standards in many
industrial, energy, and instrumentation applications.

The circuit uses the following key components:

Required Equipment
------------------

- EVAL-CN0590-EBZ evaluation board
- Host PC with High-Speed USB 2.0 support
- USB flash drive with High-Speed USB 2.0 support
- USB Type-C cable supporting both power and data signaling
- Type-C male to Type-A female adapter

Setup and Test
--------------

No evaluation software is required. The board operates transparently as a
USB 2.0 high-speed isolated retimer between host and device.

To test the USB 2.0 functionality of the EVAL-CN0590-EBZ, follow the steps
below:

   High-speed data transfer test setup

#. Using the Type-C to Type-A adapter, connect the USB flash drive to **P6** of
   the EVAL-CN0590-EBZ.
#. Connect the Type-C USB cable to **P1** of the EVAL-CN0590-EBZ and then the
   other end of the cable to the computer USB port. Wait for the USB flash
   drive to be detected on the computer.
#. Validate the speed of the USB flash drive using a USB device tree viewer.
   The screenshot below shows an example device tree of a high-speed USB
   device.
