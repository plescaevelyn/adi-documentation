EVAL-CN0548-ARDZ
=================

Isolated Current and Voltage Measurement Arduino Shield.

Overview
--------

Testing and evaluating power systems in industrial and communications settings
often requires multiple voltage and current measurements. Individual supplies
may be referenced to different grounds, have either positive or negative
polarity, or may be galvanically isolated with respect to other power domains.
Such scenarios necessitate either individual floating multimeters, or
multichannel meters with per-channel isolation, which are physically cumbersome
and expensive.

   EVAL-CN0548-ARDZ Evaluation Board (3D View)

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0548-ARDZ <CN0548>` is a complete, isolated current and
voltage measurement system for industrial, telecommunications, instrumentation,
and automated test equipment (ATE) applications. The system is galvanically
isolated from the host controller and will tolerate up to plus/minus 250 V
between the host computer and measurement system grounds. When paired with the
:adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` and open-source firmware example, application software
can easily communicate with the CN0548 over the industry-standard Industrial
Input/Output (IIO) libiio library, which includes bindings for C, C#, MATLAB,
Python, and LabVIEW.

Configuring the Input Voltage Polarity and Current Direction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using the CN0548, the user must know the expected inputs and configure
the board accordingly. The polarity as well as the direction of the inputs is
an important aspect that should be noted by the user.

.. list-table:: Maximum Input Rating by Configuration
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Mode
     - Minimum Input
     - Maximum Input

Jumper connections P12 and P13 configure the input current setting while
jumpers P7 and P14 configure the input voltage setting:

- For a **unipolar** and **unidirectional** setting, the jumpers should be
  shorted to the GND pin.
- For a **bipolar** and **bidirectional** setting, the jumpers should be
  connected to the 2.048 V pin.

Configuring the Absolute Input Voltage Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CN0548 is equipped with a precision wide voltage range, gain-selectable
attenuating difference amplifier allowing it to have an adjustable input
voltage range feature. The onboard jumpers P1, P3, P10, P8, P9, P11 should be
configured accordingly to achieve the desired maximum voltage range for finer
voltage resolution.

Chip Select
~~~~~~~~~~~

The CN0548 has a remappable Chip Select feature allowing the board to be
stacked with other shields. By default, jumper P15 is shunted but this can be
modified accordingly depending on the shields stacked and the user's
application.

Demo Requirements
-----------------

A sample code for the board is already provided. The following is the list of
items needed in order to run the given script.

**Hardware**

- EVAL-CN0548-ARDZ
- :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029`
- Micro-USB to USB cable
- PC or laptop with a USB port

**Software**

- Pre-built HEX file (see below)
- Python 3.7 or later
- `CN0548_simple_plot.py example script
  <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio/tree/main/examples/cn0548>`__
- Recommended IDEs: Visual Studio Code, Anaconda, or PyCharm

Setting up the Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Attach the EVAL-CN0548-ARDZ shield to the EVAL-ADICUP3029.
#. Connect a micro-USB cable to the P10 connector of the EVAL-ADICUP3029 and
   connect it to a computer.

Flashing the Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get started with the CN0548 board is by using the pre-built
hex file for the EVAL-ADICUP3029:

#. Ensure the on-board switches of the EVAL-ADICUP3029 are configured as shown
   in the ADICUP3029 documentation.
#. Connect the ADICUP3029 to the PC host via micro-USB cable.
#. From the PC, open My Computer and look for the DAPLINK drive. If the drive
   appears, the drivers are installed correctly.
#. Download the hex file corresponding to the input mode you configured. Simply
   drag and drop the hex file to the DAPLINK drive. The DS2 (red) LED will
   blink rapidly. It will stop blinking and stay ON once programming is
   complete.
#. Disconnect then reconnect the EVAL-ADICUP3029 to the host computer.

Using CrossCore Embedded Studio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For advanced applications, import the project into CrossCore Embedded Studio
(CCES) to explore the board capabilities in detail and create a customized
project:

#. Open CrossCore Embedded Studio and import the project into your workspace.
#. Once ready, generate your own hex file or use a debug session by following
   the CCES quickstart guide.

Code Configuration Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When generating a custom hex file, there are two important attributes from the
AD7798/AD7799 family that must be configured:

   CCES Code Snippet Showing Polarity and Gain Configuration

- **Polarity** -- It is important to set the polarity of the ADC according to
  your configuration and application. When the polarity is set to unipolar,
  effectively restricting the user to follow the polarity of the terminals, the
  maximum bit resolution of the ADC is used in its conversion. When set to
  bipolar, the effective bit resolution is (n-1) bits where n is the maximum bit
  resolution of the ADC.

- **Gain** -- The gain attribute corresponds to the internal gain of the ADC. A
  user can apply an internal gain to the ADC allowing the differential ADC
  input to be amplified. This feature can be useful when dealing with small
  signals, but applying an internal gain effectively decreases the input rating
  of the board. It is highly recommended to consult the ADC datasheet before
  creating a customized hex file.

PyADI-IIO
~~~~~~~~~~

PyADI-IIO is a Python abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO drivers to
make them easier to use. This module provides device-specific APIs built on
top of the current libiio Python bindings. These interfaces try to match the
driver naming as much as possible without the need to understand the
complexities of libiio and IIO.

For more information on setting up PyADI-IIO, refer to the
:dokuwiki:`PyADI-IIO documentation
</resources/tools-software/linux-software/pyadi-iio>`.

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample code includes several useful features:

- A simple graphic aid to help configure board jumpers for the desired
  specification
- Numerical readings display
- Built-in data logging to CSV
- Real-time plotting
- Memory feature to reuse the previous session's configuration

Starting a New Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Download the `CN0548_simple_plot.py
   <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio/tree/main/examples/cn0548>`__
   script. Using a terminal, navigate to the location of the file and run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python CN0548_simple_plot.py

#. Upon running the script, general reminders regarding board usage will be
   displayed. Read the reminders and press Enter to proceed.

   .. figure:: reminder.png
      :width: 600 px
      :align: center

      Board Usage Reminders Displayed at Script Startup

#. The board has a memory feature that allows quick configuration using the
   settings from the last session. If no session record file is found, a new
   configuration will be started.

        - Enable or disable CSV logging
      * - Plot Mode
        - Tracking or non-tracking display
      * - COM Port
        - Serial port where the ADICUP3029 is connected

#. Enter the port where the ADICUP3029 is connected. If the port is found, the
   sample code is ready to parse readings from the board. Press Enter to start
   board operation.

      Software Configuration and COM Port Selection

Regardless of whether the plot window is enabled, board readings will be
continuously displayed in the terminal.

.. figure:: readings.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   Real-Time Board Readings Displayed in the Terminal

In the following two figures, the CN0548 was used to monitor the performance of
a 5 V regulator.

**Tracking Mode** displays all data points in the plot. This allows the user to
observe the overall characteristic of the signal being measured. However, the
plot will continue to compress as more data points are added.

.. figure:: tracking.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   Tracking Mode -- All Data Points Displayed

**Non-tracking Mode** displays only the most recent measurements as configured
by the user, providing a more refined view of the signal.

.. figure:: non-tracking.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   Non-Tracking Mode -- Most Recent Samples Displayed

The plot windows are created using the matplotlib package. You can save a copy
of the displayed waveform at any point in time using the matplotlib save
function.

Data Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data logging feature logs all measurements into a CSV file. If enabled, the
CSV file will be created in the same folder where the sample code is located
and follows the naming scheme ``CN0548_[timestamp]``. Data is automatically
written upon parsing, so even if the program is prematurely terminated, all
parsed data is recorded.

   :width: 400 px
   :align: center

   CSV Data Logging Output File

Memory Feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The memory feature allows the user to quickly configure the sample code using
the setup from the previous session. This is done by saving all user input and
creating a ``session_record`` text file in the same directory where the sample
code is located.

.. figure:: old_overview.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   Previous Session Detected -- Memory Feature Prompt

The contents of the session record file are not encrypted and are easily
understandable. Each line begins with a number corresponding to a certain
setting. For instance, 1 corresponds to the Unipolar-Unidirectional mode and 2
corresponds to the Bipolar-Bidirectional mode. If only a minor aspect of the
setup needs to be changed (for example, switching between tracking and
non-tracking mode, adjusting the sampling rate, or enabling data logging), the
user can edit the ``session_record`` file directly.

.. figure:: session_record.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

   Session Record File Contents

The program detects whether the set of specifications in the session record is
valid. If the configuration is invalid, the program proceeds as usual and
assumes no session record file was detected.
