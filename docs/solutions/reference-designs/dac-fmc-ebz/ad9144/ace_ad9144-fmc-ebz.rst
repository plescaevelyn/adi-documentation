EVALUATING THE AD9144 DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER
=================================================

Preface
-------

This user guide describes both the hardware and software setup needed to acquire data capture from :adi:`AD9144-FMC-EBZ <EVAL-AD9144>` evaluation board to characterize :adi:`AD9144` 16-bit 2.8Gsps quad JESD204B signal processing RF Digital to Analog Converter.

The :adi:`AD9144-FMC-EBZ <EVAL-AD9144>` is an FMC mezzanine card and connects to an :adi:`ADS7-V2 <eval-ads7-v2>` data pattern generator system. The ADS7-V2 automatically formats the data and sends it to the AD9144-FMC-EBZ via its JESD204B lanes. +12V, +3.3V, and VADJ power supply rails are provided by the ADS7-V2 system via the FMC connector P1. A clock distribution chip AD9516 is included on this EVB as a clock fan-out and frequency divider for the DACCLK, JESD204B SYSREF signals, and a GBTCLK clock used by the ADS7-V2. There is also an FMC standard I2C bus that is used by the ADS7-V2 to identify the AD9144-FMC-EBZ. This I2C interface is implemented in software in the AD9144-FMC-EBZ PIC processor (XU1). All ADS7-V2 to/from AD9144-FMC-EBZ interface signals are connected via the FMC connector P1.

Software Needed
---------------

-  :dokuwiki:`Analysis | Control | Evaluation (ACE) Software <resources/tools-software/ace>`
-  :dokuwiki:`DPG Lite <resources/tools-software/ace/dpg-lite>` (Recommended; Installed with ACE) or :dokuwiki:`DPG Downloader <resources/eval/dpg/dpgdownloader>`
-  :adi:`AD9144 ACE Plugin <plugins/ace/board.ad9144.1.2020.4400.acezip>`

.. important::

   -  Do not install ACE on a computer with DAC Software Suite.
   -  Known Issue: ACE may fail to detect HS-DAC boards, details :dokuwiki:`here <resources/tools-software/ace/knownissues>`.

Hardware Needed
---------------

-  :adi:`AD9144-FMC-EBZ <EVAL-AD9144>` Evaluation Board which comes with:

   -  USB-A to USB-Mini Cable

-  :dokuwiki:`ADS7-V2EBZ <resources/eval/ads7-v2>` Evaluation Kit which includes:

   -  12V 60W AC/DC Power Supply
   -  Power Cord
   -  USB-A to USB-B Cable

-  PC with ACE and DPG Lite Software Applications
-  Low Phase Noise High-Frequency Continuous Wave Generator
-  Signal/Spectrum Analyzer
-  (2) SMA Cables

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

-  Attach AD9144-FMC-EBZ onto the FMC connector of ADS7-V2 controller board. Connect the evaluation board to PC via USB, the continuous waveform generator output to J1, and one of the DAC outputs (J4/J5/J14/J17) to a signal/spectrum analyzer. Connect ADS7-V2 to PC via USB and to a 12V 60W AC/DC power supply, then switch the board ON using S1 beside the connector for 12V supply. Refer to :doc:`Typical Setup <ace_ad9144-fmc-ebz>` section for pictures of actual evaluation setup.
-  Set the frequency of the continuous waveform generator output to **1.5 GHz** and the output level to **+3 dBm**. Enable the output.

   ADS7-V2 and AD9144 detected in DPG Software

-  Start DPG Lite or DPG Downloader. A panel named after the detected controller board should appear at the bottom of the DPG window. The device on the evaluation board and the data interface should also be automatically detected by the software and shown at **Evaluation Board** and **Port Configuration**, respectively. See Figure 2.

   AD9144-FMC-EBZ detected in ACE

-  Open ACE. The board will automatically be recognized by the software as shown in Figure 3. Otherwise, install the plugin for AD9144 evaluation board by following the steps in this page: :dokuwiki:`Quickstart - ACE Quickstart and Plug-in Installation <resources/tools-software/ace/userguide/quickstart>`.
