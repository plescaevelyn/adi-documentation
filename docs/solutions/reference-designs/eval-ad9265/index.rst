Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`EVAL-AD9265` is a full-featured evaluation board for the
:adi:`AD9265`, a 16-bit, 125 MSPS analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
It connects to an FPGA carrier via the FMC LPC connector, enabling data
capture and analysis using standard ADI software tools.

The :adi:`AD9265` is designed to support communications applications where
high performance combined with low cost, small size, and versatility is
desired. The ADC core features a multistage, differential pipelined
architecture with integrated output error correction logic to provide 16-bit
accuracy at 125 MSPS data rates and guarantees no missing codes over the full
operating temperature range. The AD9265 is available in a Pb-free, 48-lead
LFCSP and is specified over the industrial temperature range of −40°C to
+85°C.

Features:

- SNR = 79.0 dBFS @ 70 MHz and 125 MSPS
- SFDR = 93 dBc @ 70 MHz and 125 MSPS
- Low power: 373 mW @ 125 MSPS
- 1.8 V analog supply operation
- 1.8 V CMOS or LVDS output supply
- Integer 1-to-8 input clock divider
- IF sampling frequencies to 300 MHz
- −154.3 dBm/Hz small signal input noise with 200 Ω input impedance @ 70 MHz and 125 MSPS
- Optional on-chip dither for improved SFDR with low power input signals
- Programmable internal ADC voltage reference
- Integrated ADC sample-and-hold inputs
- Flexible analog input range: 1 V p-p to 2 V p-p
- Differential analog inputs with 650 MHz bandwidth
- ADC clock duty cycle stabilizer
- Serial port control (SPI)
- User-configurable, built-in self-test (BIST) capability
- Energy-saving power-down modes
- Pin-compatible with the AD9255 (14-bit)

Applications:

- Multimode digital receivers (3G): GSM, EDGE, W-CDMA, LTE, CDMA2000, WiMAX, TD-SCDMA
- Smart antenna systems
- General-purpose software radios
- Broadband data applications
- Ultrasound equipment

Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our
:ref:`EngineerZone forums <help-and-support>`, but before that, please make
sure you read our documentation thoroughly.

To better understand the :adi:`AD9265`, we recommend using the
:adi:`EVAL-AD9265` evaluation board.
