EVAL-CN0355-PMDZ
=================

Low Power Bridge Sensor Signal Conditioner with Temperature Compensation.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0355 <CN0355>` is a complete low power signal conditioner for a
bridge-type sensor and includes a temperature compensation channel. It is ideal
for a variety of industrial pressure sensors and load cells that operate with
drive voltages between 5 V and 15 V.

The circuit can process full-scale signals from approximately 10 mV to 1 V
using the internal PGA of the 24-bit sigma-delta ADC, making it suitable for a
wide variety of pressure sensors.

The entire circuit uses only three ICs and requires only 1 mA (excluding the
bridge current). A ratiometric technique ensures that the accuracy and
stability of the system does not depend on a voltage reference.

Calibration Procedure
---------------------

This section explains the steps required to properly calibrate the
EVAL-CN0355-PMDZ.

.. admonition:: Pre-Calibration Notes

   - Choose the desired calibration option:

     - 2-point calibration does not require a temperature oven. It only
       requires the table to be filled in with numbers from the datasheet.
     - 4-point calibration requires an oven with calibrated temperature sensor
       and calibrated pressure source.
     - Dwell time of the temperature depends on the equipment being used.

   - The voltage drive set in the evaluation software should correspond to the
     configured jumper setup on the EVAL-CN0355-PMDZ.
   - All units are in PSI.
   - Sensitivity is usually found in the datasheet of the transducer to be
     used.

2-Point Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step 1** -- Set the voltage used to drive the transducer.

**Step 2** -- Set the minimum and maximum operating range of the sensor in PSI.

**Step 3** -- Set the sensitivity of the transducer that will be used.

**Step 4** -- Go to the Data Graph panel to view the measurement.

4-Point Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step 1** -- Define any two known pressure points where the calibration
conditions will be set and where the 4 points will be defined.

**Step 2** -- Set the temperature chamber at temp 1.

**Step 3** -- Under the Pressure Setting options, choose "Pressure 1 @ temp 1"
while the pressure at the chamber is set to the stated value in Pressure 1.

**Step 4** -- Click **Set Calibration Point @ temp 1** to read the voltage
generated by the transducer and the temperature voltage generated across the
RTD.

**Step 5** -- Set the chamber pressure to the stated value in Pressure 2 and
then choose "Pressure 2 @ temp 1" under the Pressure Setting options.

**Step 6** -- Click **Set Calibration Point @ temp 1** to read the voltage
generated by the transducer and the temperature voltage generated across the
RTD.

**Step 7** -- Click **Set Calibration Point @ temp 1** to read the voltage
generated by the transducer.

**Step 8** -- Set the temperature chamber at temp 2.

**Step 9** -- Repeat Steps 3 through 7 under the Temperature 2 column.
