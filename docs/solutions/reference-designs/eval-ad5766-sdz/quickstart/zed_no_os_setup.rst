#. Connect the ZedBoard to your desktop with 2 Micro-USB cables.
    - One for UART (J14)
    - One for JTAG (J17)
#. Connect the barrel jack power supply to the ZedBoard.
#. Make sure the VADJ is set to 2V5.
#. Make sure the jumpers on the evaluation board are set for your desired
   configuration. The configuration in this quickstart guide is:

#. Connect the Evaluation Board to the ZedBoard by using a SDP to FMC interposer 
   on the FMC connector of the ZedBoard (J1).
#. Connect a 3.3V Voltage Source to the J12 Connector of the Evaluation Board.
#. Connect an oscilloscope to the MUX_OUT Connector of the Evaluation Board.
#. Build the boot files and run the project. You can follow
   :external+no-OS:doc:`this guide <projects/dac/ad5766-sdz>`
#. Using the oscilloscope check your output.
