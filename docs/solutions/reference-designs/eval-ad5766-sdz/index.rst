Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`AD5766`/:adi:`AD5767` are 16-channel, 16-/12-bit, voltage output
digital-to-analog converters (DAC). The DACs generate output voltage ranges
from an external 2.5 V reference. Depending on the span selected, the
mid-point of the output span can be adjusted allowing for a minimum output
voltage as low as -20 V or a maximum output voltage of up to +14 V.

The :adi:`AD5766`/:adi:`AD5767` have integrated output buffers which can sink
or source up to 20 mA. This makes the devices suitable for Indium Phosphide
Mach Zehnder Modulator (InP-MZM) biasing applications.

The part incorporates a power-on reset circuit that ensures that the DAC
outputs power up to 0 V and remain at this level until the output range of the
DAC is configured. The outputs of all DACs are updated through register
configuration, with the added functionality of user-selectable DAC channels to
be simultaneously updated.

The :adi:`AD5766`/:adi:`AD5767` require four power supplies. AVCC is the analog
supply for the low voltage DAC circuitry. AVDD and AVSS are the positive and
negative high voltage power supplies for the output amplifiers. A VLOGIC supply
pin is provided to set the logic levels for the digital interface pins.

The devices utilize a versatile 4-wire serial interface that operates at clock
rates of up to 50 MHz for write mode and up to 10 MHz for readback and
daisy-chain mode, and is compatible with SPI, QSPI, MICROWIRE, and DSP
interface standards.

Features:

- Complete 16-channel, 12/16-bit DACs
- 8 software-programmable output ranges
- Integrated reference buffers
- Channel monitoring multiplexer
- 1.8 V logic compatibility
- Integrated DAC output buffers

Applications:

- Mach Zehnder Modulator Bias Control
- Analog Output Modules
- Process Control
- Optical Networking
- Instrumentation
- Industrial Automation
- Data acquisition systems

Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our
:ref:`EngineerZone forums <help-and-support>`, but before that, please make
sure you read our documentation thoroughly.

To better understand the :adi:`AD5766` / :adi:`AD5767`, we recommend to use
the :adi:`EVAL-AD5766/67-SD2Z <EVAL-AD5766>` evaluation board.
