EVAL-CN0409-ARDZ
=================

Water Turbidity Measurement System.

Overview
--------

:adi:`CN0409` uses the :adi:`ADPD105` photometric front end and a network of
860 nm infrared emitters and silicon PIN photodiodes to achieve a water
turbidity measurement system. The system can measure low to high water turbidity
levels ranging from 0 FTU to 1000 FTU (limited by available solution). The IR
LED and photodiode network is arranged to support two of the most recognized
turbidity measurement standards -- ISO 7027 (both ratio and non-ratio methods)
and the GLI method.

With three-point calibration, the typical accuracy that the system can achieve
is +/-0.50 FTU or +/-5% of the reading, whichever is greater. This accuracy
combined with the 0.05 FTU noise level makes the measurements obtained using
this system very reliable.

The :adi:`ADPD105`'s ambient light rejection feature makes this circuit ideal
for applications where accurate, robust, and non-contact turbidity measurements
are critical. Applications include chemical analysis and monitoring natural
bodies of water, wastewater, and drinking water.

Turbidity Measurement
---------------------

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed a design
standard known as ISO 7027 Water Quality -- Determination of Turbidity, which
is best known for its requirement of a monochromatic light source. Most
instruments that comply with this standard use an 860 nm LED light source and a
primary detector at an angle of 90 degrees. Additional detection angles are
allowed, such as a detector at an angle of 180 degrees, to increase the range
of measurable turbidity levels.

The CN0409 hardware allows for the measurement of both 90 degrees and
180 degrees scattering measurements.

Non-Ratio Measurement Method (Low Turbidity)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For turbidities between 0 FTU and 40 FTU, the 90 degree detector provides the
most linear response to scattering. At low turbidity levels, the particles are
much smaller than the wavelength of incident light; therefore, they exhibit a
symmetrical scattering distribution. As the number and size of suspended solids
increase within this range, the 90 degree detector receives a linearly
proportional amount of scattered light. This method is also known as the
non-ratio ISO 7027 because of the use of just one detector.

Ratio Measurement Method (Medium to High Turbidity)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Higher turbidity levels in the range of 40 FTU to 4,000 FTU require an
additional detector to obtain the same linear response as the non-ratio method.
Larger particles present in these types of solutions exhibit an asymmetrical
light scattering distribution that results in a higher intensity forward
scattered light. The ISO 7027 ratio method of the CN0409 uses the ratio of the
90 degree detector and the 180 degree detector to measure turbidity levels of
theoretically up to 4,000 FTU.

Vial Holder
-----------

The turbidity calibration and sample vials are held in a mechanical holder that
is specifically milled for the LaMotte-style test vial.

The photodiodes (DS1 and DS2) and LEDs (D1 and D2) should be bent slightly
backwards to allow placement of the vial holder. Once in place, carefully bend
the photodiodes and LEDs into the holes of the vial holder until they are snug
and secure.

The vial holder should be screwed into the EVAL-CN0409-ARDZ board by lining up
the holes in the vial holder with the holes in the board, using the screws
provided.

Test Vials
----------

The test vials are one of the biggest sources of measurement error within a
turbidity system and therefore one of the most important factors to consider in
obtaining accurate turbidity measurements.

.. note::

   It is recommended to use `LaMotte test vials
   <https://www.coleparmer.com/i/lamotte-0290-6-turbidity-sample-test-tubes-vials-6-pk/0556366>`__
   as the size fits into the CN0409 board vial holder.

   Example LaMotte-style test vial.

The following items are critical to the success of proper turbidity vial
preparation and measurement techniques:

Cleaning Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain the most accurate results when taking measurements, the following
process should be followed:

- Test vials **MUST** be meticulously cleaned:

  #. Wash the vials with soap and deionized water.
  #. Soak the sample vial in hydrochloric acid solution.
  #. Rinse with ultra-filtered deionized water.
  #. Polish with silicone oil.

Indexing Vials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test vials must also be indexed. After the cleaning process, the vial is used
to measure a very low turbidity solution.

- Use a calibrated FTU solution to ensure that the index is properly assessed
  and assigned.

The position with the lowest measured turbidity should be indexed and this
position should be used for succeeding measurements.

- If possible, use a properly indexed test vial for all subsequent
  measurements to ensure the system is working and calibrated properly.

Measurement Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Fill a clean test vial (see cleaning procedure above) with up to 10 mL of
   the solution under test.
#. Allow sufficient time for bubbles to escape before placing the cap. This can
   be done by letting the solution stand for several minutes to allow the
   bubbles to vacate.
#. Wipe the test vial with a lint-free cloth before inserting into the on-board
   test vial holder to make sure it is free from fingerprints. Make sure to
   hold the test vial by the cap when placing it in the holder.

Calibration Solutions
---------------------

Calibration solutions are an important baseline to ensure that your measurement
system is working appropriately. They are needed to perform the calibration
calculations and routines within the software, providing accurate turbidity
measurements.

.. note::

   The turbidity calibration solutions used in the evaluation are:

   - `HI88703-11
     <https://hannainst.com/turbidity-calibration-standards-for-hi88703-and-hi83414-hi88703-11.html>`__
   - `Oakton T100
     <https://www.coleparmer.com/i/oakton-t100-replacement-turbidity-calibration-kit/3563552>`__
   - `Cole Parmer kit
     <https://www.johnmorrisgroup.com/AU/Product/48740/Cole-Parmer-Turbidity-Standards-Pack>`__

The calibration solution sets allow testing and characterization at many
different data points and comparison of results against many different available
products on the market. Available calibration solution values within these kits
include:

- 0.10, 15.0, 100, 750, and 2000 NTU
- 0.02, 20.0, 100, and 800 NTU
- 0.5, 10, and 40 NTU

Hardware Setup (ADICUP360)
--------------------------

#. To program the base board, set the jumpers/switches as described in the
   EVAL-ADICUP360 user guide.
#. Connect the EVAL-CN0409-ARDZ to the Arduino connectors **P2**, **P5**,
   **P6**, **P7**, **P8** of the EVAL-ADICUP360 board.
#. Plug in the USB cable from the PC to the EVAL-ADICUP360 base board via the
   Debug USB (**P14**).

Calibration Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the project is being run for the first time, a calibration procedure is
required in order to achieve high-accuracy results. The user must follow the
steps described in the UART terminal when the application is started.

The user has the option to modify the solutions that are used for calibrating
the device. Any values can be used for the calibration points, but a proper
distribution along the 0--1000 NTU range must be taken into account.

.. note::

   The calibration values can be edited in the ``CN0409.h`` file inside the
   include folder within the project structure.

After the calibration sequence is done at least once, the calibration
coefficients are saved in the controller flash memory and will be used the
next time when calibration is not performed. The calibration can be repeated
as desired. If the program is run for the first time and a calibration routine
is not done, the program will prompt the user to manually input calibration
coefficients.

Software Demo Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Fill a clean test vial with up to 10 mL of the solution under test.
#. Allow sufficient time for bubbles to escape before placing the cap.
#. Wipe the test vial with a lint-free cloth before inserting into the on-board
   test vial holder.
#. Open the serial terminal program (e.g. PuTTY) and press the reset button on
   the EVAL-ADICUP360.
#. Follow the on-screen prompt for calibration.

   .. note::

      For first-time use, it is required to perform calibration by pressing the
      **y** key. For subsequent measurements, press the **n** key to skip
      calibration.

#. Three-point calibration will be performed using 0.02 FTU, 100 FTU, and
   800 FTU. Wait for the on-screen prompt before placing each solution.
#. After calibration, place the solution to be measured as prompted on the
   screen.

.. note::

   Make sure to hold the test vial by the cap when placing it in the holder.
