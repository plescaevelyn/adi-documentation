Introduction
------------

The :adi:`ADMV96S-WGBE-EK1` is a complete evaluation and
prototyping system for 60 GHz short data links. It consists of a pair of
receiver and transmitter boards with a 1 Gbps Ethernet interface on each side of
the wireless link.

The evaluation kit enables customers to evaluate the technology at its full
potential, configure the system for their particular applications to mitigate
risks of operation failure, provide a proven recipe to use for final product
development. The users to set up a 60 GHz short range data link using standard
interfaces. For programming and configuring the data link, the user has software
tools available for download.

The 60 GHz wireless link is implemented by the :adi:`ADMV9615` and
:adi:`ADMV9525` modules. These are coupled with a SerDes device
which translates the modules’ SGMII interface to RGMII so that it can be
connected to an ADIN1300 industrial low latency and low power 1 Gbps Ethernet
PHY. This enables each side of the wireless link to act as an Ethernet port and
essentially create a seamless wire-like connection between two ends of an
Ethernet cable.

The on-board :adi:`MAX32650` ultralow power ARM® Cortex®-M4
microcontroller controls the system’s operation and implements the algorithms to
configure the wireless link in real time so that optimal link quality is
constantly maintained over temperature and various operating conditions. An
open-source software stack is provided for firmware development as well as
reference applications. The MAX32650 can be programmed through a programming
port which can also be used for firmware debugging.

   ADMV96S-WGBE-EK1 Hardware Setup

Set up the hardware following these steps:

#. For both boards, make sure the S1 switch is in a position that corresponds to
   the label printed on the module inserted in P2. The wireless link will only
   work between an ADMV9615 and an ADMV9625 with the S1 switches correctly
   configured.
#. Mount the ADMV9615 and ADMV9625 assemblies onto the rail system as pictured
#. Connect CAT5 RJ45 Ethernet cables (3, 4) through the system (from a PC to a
   router, from a PC to another PC, etc.)
#. **Optionally**, connect the MAXDAP programmers (7) using micro-USB cables to
   your PC’s COM ports to be able to use the Wethlink GUI application*
#. Connect the 12V power supplies (2)

Power Supply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ADMV96S-WGBE-EK1 kit contains two VEL36US120-US-JA 12V, 36W AC/DC external
wall mount (Class II) adapters. The board has a DC barrel jack connector
dedicated for power supply with the following mating dimensions: 2.10mm ID
(0.083“) and 5.50mm OD (0.217”). It accepts voltages between 4V and 16V, but
it is recommended to be supplied with 12V.

Power tree

   Power Tree Diagram

The main DC/DC regulator is the :adi:`LTM4623`, designed for 5V
output. This will supply the ADMV96x5 and all the circuits on the
ADMV96S-WGBE-EK1 board. The LTM4623 supports selectable discontinuous mode
operation and output voltage tracking for supply rail sequencing. Its high
switching frequency and current mode control enable a very fast transient
response to line and load changes while providing very good stability.

The :adi:`LTC3621` synchronous step-down regulator is the next in
the power chain. The board uses the fixed version of this regulator but is
also designed to be compatible with the adjustable version. The 3V3 rail is
used to supply the PHY, MCU, and SerDes VDDIO, and is also used as an input
for the :adi:`ADP170` and :adi:`LT3020` linear regulators that generate the
lower voltage rails.
