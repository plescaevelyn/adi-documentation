Evaluation Board Software
=========================

Installing the Software
-----------------------

`Evaluation Board Software version 1.1 <resources/10_lead_pulsar_rev_a_gerbers.zip>`_ is available to download.

.. tip::

   The software install is a two part install, user should proceed through both
   parts prior to connecting board for first time

Install the software prior to connecting the SDP board to the USB port of the
PC. This ensures that the SDP board is recognized when it connects to the PC.

-  Start the Windows® operating system and insert CD.
-  The installation software should launch automatically. If it does not, run the setup.exe file from the CD.
-  After installation is completed, power-up the EVAL board as described in Power Supplies section.
-  Plug the evaluation board into the SDP board and the SDP board into the PC using the USB cable included in the box.
-  When the software detects the EVAL board, proceed through any dialog boxes
   that appear to finalize the installation.

The default location for the software is C:\\Program Files\\Analog Devices\\10
Lead PulSAR ADCs This location contains the executable software, datasheets and
example files.

Install Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proceed through the install allowing the software and drivers to be placed in the appropriate locations. Only after the software and drivers have been installed should you connect the SDP board to the PC. There are two portions to the software install. Firstly the software related to the evaluation board as shown in Figure 2. |image2| *Figure 2. Evaluation Board Software Installation Launches*

On board regulators generate required levels from the applied +Vs rail. The
regulators used are the ADP3334 (U9) which supplies +7V for the +Vs of the ADC
driver amplifier (ADA4841), while the ADP3303-5 delivers 5V to the SDP board
connector, J2 to power the SDP board. The SDP in turn provides a 3.3V V_DRIVE
which supplies the IOVDD of the ADC in addition to the logic gates (U1, U3, U4).
Each supply is decoupled where it enters the board and again at each device. A
single ground plane is used on this board to minimize the effect of high
frequency noise interference.

Reference
~~~~~~~~~

An external 5V reference (:adi:`ADR435` U6) is used to supply the ADCs. This reference is buffered by the :adi:`AD8032`.

Serial Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The evaluation board uses the SPORT interface from the :adi:`SDP <en/system-demonstration-platform/controller-boards/evaluation/SDP-B/eb.html>`\ BF527 DSP. A number of AND gates are used to clock and gate the SPORT transfer to the ADC device. See U1, U3, U4.

Solder Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is one 3 Solder Link Option on the board. It is configured depending on which generic of ADC is on the specific evaluation board as described below. **Table 2. Solder Link Default Setting**

Analog Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The analog inputs to the evaluation board are J3 and J4 SMB (push on) connectors. These inputs are buffered with dedicated amplifier circuitry (U8 and U12) and discrete as shown in the schematic. The circuit allows for different configurations, input range scaling, filtering, addition of a DC component, use of different op-amp and supplies. The analog input amplifiers are set as unity gain buffers at the factory. The Amplifier positive rail is driven from +7V (from :adi:`ADP3334`, U9), this could be changed to a different value as required, the negative amplifier rail is driven from –Vs which is applied direct to the board. The range of supply possible is listed in Table 1. The default configuration sets both U8 and U12 at mid-scale generated from a buffered reference voltage divider (VCM). The evaluation board is factory configured for providing either a single ended path or a fully differential path as described in Table 2. For dynamic performance, an FFT test can be done by applying a very low distortion AC source. For low frequency testing, the Audio Precision source can be used directly as the outputs on these are isolated. Set the outputs for balanced and floating. Different sources can be used however, most are single ended and use a fixed output resistance. Since the evaluation board uses the amplifiers in unity gain, the non-inverting input has a common mode input with a series 590 ohm resistor and it needs to be taken into account when directly connecting a source (voltage divider).

Board Operation
---------------

-  Connect SDP controller board to the evaluation board with the J2 connector (screw into place as required). The software is configured to find the evaluation board on either connector of the SDP board.
-  Power board with appropriate supply as described.
-  Connect to PC with USB cable provided
-  Launch software. Click Start > All Programs > Analog Devices > 10 Lead PulSAR ADCs.
-  Apply signal source and capture data

Running the software with hardware connected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the program, do the following:

-  Click Start > All Programs > Analog Devices > 10 Lead PulSAR ADCs. To uninstall the program, click Start > Control Panel > Add or Remove Programs > 10 Lead PulSAR ADCs.
-  If the SDP board is not connected to the USB port when the software is
   launched, a connectivity error is displayed.

.. image:: images/sdp_-_no_hardware.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 200

Simply connect the EVAL board to the USB port of the PC, wait a few seconds,
click Rescan, and follow the instructions.

.. image:: images/sdp_-_found_board.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 200

The software connects to the board and displays the following:

.. image:: images/sdp_-_wait.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 200

Once the board has been correctly detected, the software panel will open. The
example below shows the AD7691 panel.

Description of User Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is the description of the user panel:

-  File menu with choice of

   -  Load Data: load previously captured data
   -  Save Data as .tsv: save captured data in tsv (tab separated values) format for future analysis
   -  Save Picture: use to save the current screen capture
   -  Print
   -  Exit

-  When hardware is connected to the USB port, the software automatically detects which generic is connected and displays it here. Without hardware, the software can be operated in standalone mode for data analysis, and the part information will note the part number pulled from the saved data file.
-  Sampling Frequency: The default sampling frequency will match the maximum sample rate of the ADC connected to the board. The user can adjust the sampling frequency; however, there are limitations around the sample frequency related to the SCLK frequency applied. The sample frequency must be an integer divider of the SCLK frequency. In addition, where unusable sample frequencies are input, the software automatically adjusts the sample frequency accordingly. Units can be entered, such as 10k for 10,000 Hz. Because the maximum sample frequency possible is device dependent, with some of the ADCs capable of operating up to 250 kSPS, while others can go to 1.3 MSPS, the software will match the particular ADC ability. If the user enters a value larger than the ability of the existing device, the software will indicate this and revert to the maximum sample frequency.
-  SCLK Frequency: The default SCLK frequency is set to 60 MHz, which is the maximum allowable from the SDP. The SCLK is applied to the ADC SCK pin. The SDP board limits the SCLK frequency, nominal values for correct operation are 60 MHz, 30 MHz, and 20 MHz. Where the user adjusts the SCLK/sample rate to values that are not supported by the SDP clock or the ADC sample rate, the software overrides by adjusting values accordingly and identify this to the user. The SCLK frequency will be rounded down.
-  External reference voltage. By default, this reference is 5V (:adi:`ADR435` on board reference). The min/max voltage calculations are based on this reference voltage. If user changes the reference voltage, then they should change this input accordingly.
-  “Read” : to perform a single capture
-  “Start” : to perform a continuous capture from the ADC.
-  “Stop”: to stop streaming data
-  Select the number of samples to analyse, when running continuously, this number will be limited to 65536 samples.
-  There are four tabs available displaying the data in different formats, this
   are listed here and described in more detail later.

   -  Waveform tab
   -  Histogram
   -  FFT
