I/Q Data Files
===============

This page describes the I/Q data file formats supported by the IIO Oscilloscope
DAC Buffer Output mode, and provides reference data files for several digital
baseband modulation schemes with corresponding Simulink models.

   DAC Buffer Output mode in IIO Oscilloscope

Data Formats
------------

MATLAB Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IIO Oscilloscope application uses the
`MAT File I/O Library <https://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/>`__ to read
MATLAB files.

There are two ways to scale the data:

- **Less than +/-1.0**: +/-1.0 will be assumed as full scale, so +/-0.5 will
  come out as half scale.
- **More than +/-1.0**: The max point in the data will be found, and this will
  be assumed to be full scale.

There are two ways to arrange the data:

- Vectors of complex data
- Vectors of real data (first vector is Q/real, second is I/imaginary)

Binary Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In binary format each I or Q word is in 16-bit signed format. The AD9361
bus-width is 12-bit. Therefore Bit 11 becomes Bit 15 (shifted by 4, lower 4
bits are ignored).

An I and Q word together make up one complex symbol for one output channel.
In the 2TX output configuration, a complete sample consists of two complex IQ
symbols (one for each transmitter), making it 64-bit wide:

   :header-rows: 1

   * - TX 0
     -
     - TX 1
     -
   * - I0
     - Q0
     - I1
     - Q1

ASCII Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A valid ASCII file is prefixed with a ``TEXT`` magic string. Values are
delimited by commas, spaces, or tabs. Samples are separated by rows.

In a 2TX configuration, with only one symbol per line it will be repeated for
the second TX:

.. code-block::

   TEXT
   501.000000000	-1.000000000
   405.000000000	294.000000000
   155.000000000	476.000000000
   -154.000000000	475.000000000
   ...

Two symbols per line (one for TX1 and TX2):

.. code-block::

   TEXT
   0.0002274,0.0002274,0.0002274,-0.0002274
   -0.002085,-0.002085,-0.002085,0.002085
   -0.001768,-0.001768,-0.001768,0.001768
   0.001351,0.001351,0.001351,-0.001351
   ...

The file is automatically scaled to full scale. The ``TEXTU`` option provides
unscaled data with the following valid ranges:

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Board
     - Range
   * - FMCOMMS1
     - +/- 32767.0

These waveforms are provided with IIO Oscilloscope for demonstration purposes
and can be loaded into different devices. However, they are generally not meant
for transceiver characterization or demodulation. For such tasks, creating
custom waveforms using tools such as MATLAB is recommended.

.. note::

   The modulated waveforms (QPSK, MSK, etc.) are designed to go through a
   receiver design (root raised cosine decimator, equalization, frequency
   compensation, retiming, etc.). Since there is no default receiver in the
   ADI HDL design, looking at things with the IIO Oscilloscope will not show
   clean constellations. This is expected and normal.

QPSK Data Files
---------------

QPSK Without Pulse Shaping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A QPSK transmission model without any pulse shaping filter. Since there are
two independent channels on the TX paths, both are modeled identically.

.. figure:: software/QPSKnofilt.png
   :align: center

   QPSK Simulink model without pulse shaping

Without pulse shaping, the rectangular-pulse QPSK symbols occupy the entire
signal bandwidth, potentially disturbing adjacent channels.

.. figure:: software/resultnofilt.png
   :align: center

   QPSK spectrum without pulse shaping

The generated data format uses one line per sample: ``I1, Q1, I2, Q2``, with
the word ``TEXT`` on the first line.

QPSK With Pulse Shaping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A root-raised cosine pulse-shaping filter is used to smooth the QPSK pulses in
the time domain, limiting the signal bandwidth to 10 MHz.

Data Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before verifying data in the IIO Oscilloscope, ensure the ADC and DAC sample
rate is set to 30.72 MSPS.

.. figure:: software/iiosetting_new.png
   :align: center

   IIO Oscilloscope sample rate settings

Since there is no matched receive filter on the AD9361 receive path, the raw
received constellation will not show a clean QPSK pattern:

Use the **Save Data** function (File > Save As, select ``.mat`` format) to
export data for verification in MATLAB with a matched receive filter:

After applying a matched receive filter and phase offset compensation in
Simulink, the QPSK constellation is clearly verified:

Sample C Code Application
--------------------------

A sample C application for generating binary I/Q waveform files:

.. code-block:: c

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>
   #include <stdint.h>
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <math.h>

   int main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
       FILE *file;
       int i, c, f = 10, j, d = 1;
       unsigned int *buf;
       double ampl;
       short ipart, qpart;

       while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, "f:a:s")) != -1)
           switch (c) {
           case 'f':
               f = atoi(optarg);
               break;
           case 'a':
               ampl = atof(optarg);
               break;
           case 's':
               d = 0;
               break;
           default:
               return 0;
           }

       buf = malloc(f * (d ? 8 : 4));

       if (ampl > 1.0)
           ampl = 1.0;
       else if (ampl < 0.0)
           ampl = 0.0;

       /* AD9361 12-bit MSB aligned [(2^(12-1) - 1) * 16] */
       ampl = ampl * 32767;

       for (i = 0, j = 0; i < f; i++) {
           ipart = ampl * sin(2 * M_PI * (double)i / (double)(f));
           qpart = ampl * cos(2 * M_PI * (double)i / (double)(f));

           buf[j++] = (ipart << 16) | (qpart & 0xFFFF);

           if (d) /* Second Channel */
               buf[j++] = (ipart << 16) | (qpart & 0xFFFF);
       }

       file = fopen(argv[optind], "w");
       if (file == NULL) {
           free(buf);
           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
       }

       fwrite(buf, (d ? 8 : 4), f, file);
       fclose(file);
       free(buf);

       exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
   }

Usage examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Full scale, 20 samples per period
   gcc do_iq.c -o do_iq -lm
   ./do_iq -a 1.0 -f 20 cw_fullscale_f20.bin

   # Half scale, 20 samples per period
   ./do_iq -a 0.5 -f 20 cw_halfscale_f20.bin
