ZCU102 Quick Start Guide
=========================

This guide provides instructions on how to set up the AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ on
the Xilinx :xilinx:`ZCU102 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-u1-zcu102-g.html>` Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC evaluation board.

Required Hardware
-----------------

- Xilinx :xilinx:`ZCU102 <products/boards-and-kits/ek-u1-zcu102-g.html>` board
- AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ or AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ FMC board
- Micro-USB cable (for UART)
- SD card (16 GB or larger)

Required Software
-----------------

- SD card image: latest :doc:`Kuiper Linux </linux/kuiper/index>` release
- A UART terminal (PuTTY / Tera Term / Minicom), baud rate 115200 (8N1)

SD Card Setup
-------------

#. Write the latest Kuiper Linux image to the SD card.
#. Copy the following files into the **BOOT** partition of the SD card
   (replace files if they already exist):

   - **Image** file from ``zynqmp-common``
   - **BOOT.BIN** from ``zynqmp-zcu102-rev10-ad936x-fmcomms2-3-4``
   - **system.dtb** from ``zynqmp-zcu102-rev10-ad9361-fmcomms2-3``

#. Safely eject the SD card.

Hardware Setup
--------------

#. Connect the AD-FMCOMMS2-EBZ FMC board to the **HPC0** FMC socket on the
   ZCU102.
#. Connect USB UART (J83, Micro USB) to your host PC.
#. Insert the SD card into the ZCU102 card slot.
#. Configure the ZCU102 for SD boot (SW6 switches).
#. Turn on the power switch on the FPGA board.
#. Observe kernel and serial console messages on your terminal.

Expected Boot Messages
----------------------

After power-on, the UART terminal will display U-Boot and Linux kernel boot
messages. Key messages to look for:

- ``ad9361 spi1.0: ad9361_probe : AD936x Rev 2 successfully initialized``
  confirms successful AD9361 initialization.
- ``cf_axi_dds ... probed DDS AD9361`` confirms the AXI DAC DDS core is
  operational.
- ``cf_axi_adc ... probed ADC AD9361 as MASTER`` confirms the AXI ADC core is
  operational.

After boot completes, log in with:

- Username: ``analog``
- Password: ``analog``

IIO Oscilloscope
----------------

The IIO Oscilloscope application can be used locally (if HDMI is connected) or
remotely over the network.

For remote access:

#. Determine the board's IP address (check UART console for DHCP assignment or
   use ``ip addr``).
#. Build and start the IIO Oscilloscope on your host PC.
#. Go to **Settings > Connect** and enter the IP address.

The FMCOMMS2 plugin provides control of TX/RX LO frequencies, sample rates,
RF bandwidth, gain control, DDS tone generation, and FIR filter management.

Building from Source
--------------------

Instructions for building the ZynqMP / MPSoC Linux kernel and devicetrees from
source:

- `Building the ZynqMP boot image BOOT.BIN
  <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/hdl/user_guide/introduction.html>`__
- :doc:`Kuiper Linux </linux/kuiper/index>` for SD card image creation

Networking
----------

By default, DHCP is enabled. A static IP can be configured using the
``enable_static_ip.sh`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

   enable_static_ip.sh <ip_address> eth0

.. note::

   The ``enable_static_ip.sh`` script fixes the IP address of the desired
   Ethernet adapter and prevents the onboard network manager from changing it.
   This is required for directly connected Ethernet cables without DHCP servers.
