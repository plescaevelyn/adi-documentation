AD-FMCXMWBR1-EBZ User Guide
============================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD-FMCXMWBR1-EBZ` is an FMC-compatible level translator and power
supply board that bridges FPGA/controller devices with
`X-Microwave <https://www.xmicrowave.com/>`__ blocks. It provides SPI, I2C,
and GPIO interfaces with bidirectional voltage level translation, along with
multiple power supply outputs for the X-Microwave ecosystem.

The board draws power from the FMC connector but has the option to add an
external supply for applications that require higher load currents.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- FMC HPC form factor with level translation
- Multiple supply voltage outputs with high current capability
- 2x SPI buses, 2x I2C buses, 8 GPIO channels
- Compatible with X-Microwave controller and Raspberry Pi
- Powered from FMC connector with optional external 12 V supply

Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- RF and microwave prototyping with X-Microwave blocks
- Software-defined radio (SDR)
- Radar systems
- Point-to-point communications
- MIMO radio systems
- Automated test equipment (ATE)

Power Supply
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The board uses an :adi:`LTC4418` dual-channel prioritized powerpath controller
to select between two input sources, with priority given to the external
supply.

Quick Start
-----------

The AD-FMCXMWBR1-EBZ is a dual-board kit. The FMC Bridge Board (AD-FMCBRIDGE1A)
plugs into the FMC connector on the carrier, while the Protoplate Interface Board
(AD-FMCBRIDGE1B) mounts on a 32x32 X-Microwave prototype plate and connects to
the bridge board via the included ribbon and power cables.

The board supports three setup modes:

FMC Carrier Setup (ADRV9009-ZU11EG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Set up the :ref:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG <adrv9009zu11eg>` base system on the
   ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier following its quick start guide.
#. Connect Ethernet from the ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier to your network.
#. Attach a DisplayPort monitor to the carrier board.
#. Connect a USB OTG adapter with a USB hub for keyboard and peripherals.
#. Insert the AD-FMCXMWBR1-EBZ into the FMC HPC connector.
#. Use the provided ribbon and power cables to connect the bridge board to the
   protoplate and your X-Microwave setup.
#. Power on the carrier board.

X-Microwave Controller Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The P10 connector provides a 40-pin header compatible with both the X-Microwave
controller and a Raspberry Pi. Connect the X-Microwave controller or Raspberry
Pi to P10 using a 40-pin ribbon cable. The provided cables then link the
protoplate to your X-Microwave prototype plate.

.. note::

   The FMC (P1) and Raspberry Pi/X-MW Controller (P10) interfaces cannot be
   used simultaneously.

.. note::

   The adjustable power supplies (potentiometer-controlled) default to their
   maximum output values at power-up.

HDL Reference Design
--------------------

The AD-FMCXMWBR1-EBZ HDL design is a variant of the
:ref:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG <adrv9009zu11eg>` reference design. It extends the base
design with AXI-based SPI and I2C cores along with GPIO control for the
X-Microwave bridge module. The FMC HPC connector on the ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier
is used to interface with the bridge board.

Software Support
----------------

The Linux reference design exposes the following interfaces on the
ADRV9009-ZU11EG + ADRV2CRR-FMC platform:

- **2x AXI SPI** cores (accessible as ``/dev/spidevX.Y``), supporting devices
  such as the :adi:`AD5721R` DAC
- **2x AXI I2C** cores, supporting devices such as the :adi:`AD7291` ADC
- **AXI GPIO** controller, providing access to 8 GPIO lines via
  ``/sys/class/gpio``

IIO devices enumerated on a typical boot include SPI-connected DACs and
I2C-connected ADCs, accessible through the standard Linux IIO subsystem.
