165 MHz, High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI®) transmitter

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`ADV7513` is a 165 MHz, High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI®)
transmitter ideal for DVD players/recorders, digital set-top boxes, A/V
receivers, gaming consoles, and PCs.

The digital video interface contains an HDMI v1.4/DVI v1.0-compatible
transmitter that supports all HDTV formats. The :adi:`ADV7513` supports HDMI
v1.4-specific features including 3D video, x.v.Color™, high bit rate (HBR)
audio, and the programmable auxiliary video information (AVI) InfoFrame
features. With HDCP v1.4, the :adi:`ADV7513` allows secure transmission of
protected content.

The :adi:`ADV7513` supports both S/PDIF and 8-channel I²S audio. Its 8-channel
I²S interface can transmit stereo or 7.1 surround audio up to 768 kHz. The
S/PDIF interface can carry compressed audio including Dolby® Digital, DTS®, and
THX®.

Features:

- Incorporates HDMI v1.4 features, including 3D video support
- 165 MHz supports all video formats up to 1080p and UXGA
- Supports gamut metadata packet transmission
- Integrated CEC buffer/controller
- Compatible with DVI v1.0 and HDCP v1.4
- Video/audio inputs accept logic levels from 1.8 V to 3.3 V
- Programmable, 2-way color space converter
- Supports RGB, YCbCr 4:4:4, YCbCr 4:2:2, and DDR input formats
- Supports ITU-656-based embedded syncs
- Automatic input video format timing detection (CEA-861-E)
- Supports standard S/PDIF for stereo LPCM or compressed audio up to 192 kHz
- High bit rate (HBR) audio
- 8-channel uncompressed LPCM I²S audio up to 192 kHz
- 5 V tolerant I²C and Hot Plug™ Detect (HPD) I/Os, no extra device needed
- No audio master clock needed for supporting S/PDIF and I²S
- On-chip MPU with I²C master performs HDCP operations and EDID reading
- On-chip MPU reports HDMI events through interrupts and registers

Applications:

- Gaming consoles
- PCs
- DVD players and recorders
- Digital set-top boxes
- A/V receivers

Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with
things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it
should be. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our
:ref:`EngineerZone forums <help-and-support>`, but before that, please make
sure you read our documentation thoroughly.

To better understand the :adi:`ADV7513`, we recommend using the evaluation
board with the :adi:`ADV7513` integrated on it.
