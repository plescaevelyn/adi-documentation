EVAL-ADPD4100-ARDZ
===================

Multimodal Sensor Front End.

Overview
--------

The EVAL-ADPD410x-ARDZ is an Arduino form-factor breakout board for developing
:adi:`ADPD4100` (SPI) and :adi:`ADPD4101` (I2C) applications. The ADPD4100 is
a highly versatile, multimodal sensor front end that can stimulate up to eight
LEDs and measure the return signal on up to eight separate current inputs.

Applications include PPG (photoplethysmography), SpO2, ECG, respiration rate,
activity/fall detection, wearable health monitors, point-of-care diagnostics,
and water/air quality monitoring.

Required Equipment
------------------

- EVAL-ADPD4100-ARDZ (SPI) or EVAL-ADPD4101-ARDZ (I2C) evaluation board
- :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029` development board
- USB cable
- External photodiodes and LEDs (application-dependent)

Hardware Setup
--------------

- Arduino form-factor with standard 0.1 inch headers.
- Onboard LED for quick bring-up.
- 8 channels of LED and photodiode connections.
- Breakaway prototyping board for customized application needs.

Software Setup
--------------

Device drivers are available for the EVAL-ADICUP3029 platform. Integration
with IIO Oscilloscope and PyADI-IIO is supported for data visualization.
