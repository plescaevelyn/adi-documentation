Determining the firmware version
---------------------------------

There are a few methods to determine which version of the firmware is currently
loaded on the ADALM-PLUTO or ADALM2000.

Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a host which has libiio installed, you can query the device for its
firmware version with:

.. code-block:: bash

   iio_attr -a -C fw_version

SSH Access to the device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the default username (``root``) and password (``analog``), you can log
into the device, and the splash screen will show the firmware version.

.. image:: images/firmware/pluto_password.png

Mass Storage Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mass storage device includes an ``info.html`` file. Opening this in a
browser and clicking on the "firmware" section will show the firmware version.

.. image:: images/firmware/plutofirmwareversion.png

Pluto Rev C and D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Pluto Rev C and Pluto Rev D <pluto users intro>` users can access the USB
console via the power connector and determine the firmware version from the
login splash screen.

Upgrading
---------

.. warning::

   Only update the firmware from a trusted source. Updating firmware from an
   untrusted source may render your device inoperable or compromise the
   security of your system.

Mass Storage Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred method of firmware update is to copy a firmware file (with a
``.frm`` extension) to the mass storage device provided by the target. The
steps are:

#. Copy the firmware file to the mass storage device
#. **Eject** the device (don't just unplug it)
#. LED1 will start blinking rapidly
#. **Don't disconnect the device until rapid blinking stops!**
#. The update process takes approximately 4 minutes
#. When complete, the device will reappear as a mass storage device

Windows or OSX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the standard GUI:

#. Download the ``.frm`` file from the latest release
#. Copy it to the mass storage device

   .. image:: images/firmware/win10_gui_update.png

   .. image:: images/firmware/copyfirmware_osx2.png

#. Eject the device (right-click and select "Eject" or use the eject button)

   .. image:: images/firmware/eject-right-pluto-win10.png

   .. image:: images/firmware/eject_osx.png

#. Wait for LED1 to stop blinking rapidly
#. The device will reappear when the update is complete

Linux
^^^^^

Using the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   analog@analog:~$ wget https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw/releases/download/v0.XX/pluto.frm
   analog@analog:~$ cp pluto.frm /media/analog/PlutoSDR/
   analog@analog:~$ sudo eject /media/analog/PlutoSDR

Network Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For devices that are deployed remotely and accessed using the USB-to-Ethernet
feature, firmware can be updated over the network using the ``update_frm.sh``
utility (available since firmware v0.29).

.. code-block:: bash

   analog@analog:~$ ssh root@192.168.2.1
   root@pluto:~# cd /tmp
   root@pluto:/tmp# wget https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw/releases/download/v0.XX/pluto.frm
   root@pluto:/tmp# unzip pluto.frm
   root@pluto:/tmp# /sbin/update_frm.sh /tmp/*.frm
   root@pluto:/tmp# reboot

DFU Update
~~~~~~~~~~

When all else fails, or you want to recover from a bad firmware update, you can
use DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode to manually flash the device.

Entering DFU mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The device can enter DFU mode in several ways:

**Manually** (three methods):

#. Press the device button with a toothpick, paper-clip or similar and then
   apply power (plug in the USB cable)
#. From the device console, run: ``device_reboot sf``
#. From the U-Boot console, run: ``run dfu_sf``

**Automatically**:

If the device detects that the FIT (Flattened Image Tree) checksum is not
correct, it will automatically enter DFU mode.

Detecting DFU mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When in DFU mode:

* The **DONE LED is OFF**, while **LED1 is constantly ON**
* The USB Product ID (PID) changes from ``0xb673`` to ``0xb674``

You can verify DFU mode is active using:

**Windows**: Device Manager will show "PlutoSDR DFU" under "Universal Serial
Bus devices"

.. image:: images/firmware/device_manager_dfu.png

**Linux**: Run ``lsusb`` and look for device ID ``0456:b674``

.. code-block:: bash

   analog@analog:~$ lsusb
   Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0456:b674 Analog Devices Inc. PlutoSDR (DFU)

**Mac**: System Information → USB will show "PlutoSDR DFU" with Product ID
``0xb674``

.. image:: images/firmware/dfumode_osx.png

Updating via DFU
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows
"""""""

Run the ``UPDATE.BAT`` script included with the DFU release package. This uses
``dfu-util`` to flash the device.

.. note::

   On some systems, you may need to run the DFU utility twice. The first time
   it may fail, but the second attempt should succeed.

Linux or OSX
""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

   analog@analog:~$ sudo dfu-util -a firmware.dfu -D pluto.dfu

DFU Flash Partitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DFU partitions are listed in priority order for recovery:

#. ``firmware.dfu`` - Linux Kernel, Device Drivers and Root Filesystem
#. ``boot.dfu`` - U-Boot and First Stage Boot Loader
#. ``uboot-env.dfu`` - U-Boot environment variables
#. ``uboot-extra-env.dfu`` - Extra environment (calibration data, rarely
   modified)

If you are recovering from a bad firmware update, flash the ``firmware.dfu``
partition first. Only flash ``boot.dfu`` if absolutely necessary.

Notifications of new releases
------------------------------

To be notified of new firmware releases, you can "watch" the GitHub repository:

#. Go to the `PlutoSDR firmware repository <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw>`__
#. Click the "Watch" button in the upper right


   .. image:: images/firmware/watch.png
#. Select "Custom" and check "Releases"


   .. image:: images/firmware/watch2.png
#. Click "Apply"

You will receive an email notification whenever a new release is published.
