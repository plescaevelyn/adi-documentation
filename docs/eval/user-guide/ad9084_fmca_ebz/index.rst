AD9084-FMCA-EBZ (Apollo)
========================

Overview
--------

The Apollo mixed signal front-end (MxFEÂ®) is a highly integrated
device with a 16-bit, 28 GSPS maximum sample rate, RF
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) core, and 12-bit, 20 GSPS maximum
sample rate, RF analog-to-digital converter (ADC) core. The AD9084
supports four transmit channels and four receive channels. The
AD9084 is well suited for applications requiring both wideband
ADCs and DACs to process signal(s) having wide instantaneous
bandwidth. The device features a 48 lane, 32.5 Gbps JESD204C
or 20 Gbps JESD204B data transceiver port, an on-chip clock
multiplier, and a digital signal processing (DSP) capability targeted
at either wideband or multiband, direct to RF applications. The
AD9084 also features a bypass mode that allows the full bandwidth
capability of the ADC and/or DAC cores to bypass the DSP data-paths.
The device also features low latency loopback and frequency
hopping modes targeted at phased array radar systems and electronic
warfare applications.
