ADS-B Example Using libiio
==========================

.. note::

   This page was migrated from the
   :dokuwiki:`ADI Wiki
   <resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/clients/adsb_example>`.

Overview
--------

This page documents an airplane tracking system using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) signals. The technology allows aircraft to
broadcast their positions via satellite navigation at 1090 MHz, using the
AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ RF transceiver board with MATLAB and Simulink.

Signal Characteristics
----------------------

-  Transmit Frequency: 1090 MHz
-  Modulation: Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)
-  Data Rate: 1 Mbit/s
-  Message Length: 56 μsec or 112 μsec
-  Error Detection: 24-bit CRC checksum

Requirements
------------

-  `Stateflow <https://www.mathworks.com/products/stateflow/>`_
-  `LibIIO client for MATLAB & Simulink
   <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio/
   clients/fmcomms2_3_simulink>`_

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

-  :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ` RF transceiver board
-  Xilinx development system (ZC706, ZC702, or Zedboard)
-  1090 MHz capable antenna (e.g.,
   `ADS-B Double 1/2 Wave Mobile Antenna
   <http://www.dpdproductions.com/page_vhf_air.html#adsmobilehalf>`_)
-  Recent Zynq Linux image for the board

MATLAB Implementation
---------------------

The ``ad9361_ModeS.m`` script performs three main operations:

1. Prepare the Mode S signal
2. Calculate the earth zone according to user input
3. Receive data via libiio and decode the ADS-B signals

The script supports two operating modes depending on how *TX_LO_FREQ* and
*RX_LO_FREQ* are configured.

Pre-captured Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, the transmitter and receiver use matching local oscillator
frequencies for controlled testing. Any LO frequency supported by the board
is acceptable.

.. code-block:: matlab

   [rssi1,rssi2]=ad9361_ModeS('ip','pre-captured',channel);

For example, to receive pre-captured data on Channel 2:

.. code-block:: matlab

   [rssi1,rssi2]=ad9361_ModeS('192.168.10.2','pre-captured',2);

At the end of the simulation, RSSI values for both channels are shown in the
command window along with a result table listing decoded aircraft information:

Live Data
~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, the receiver operates at 1090 MHz to capture real aircraft
signals. *TX_LO_FREQ* must be set far from 1090 MHz to avoid interference.
With a proper antenna, the system can decode signals from aircraft within
approximately 80 miles.

.. code-block:: matlab

   [rssi1,rssi2]=ad9361_ModeS('ip','live',channel);

The result table below shows decoded real-world aircraft information. With a
proper antenna, this model is able to capture and decode aircraft signals in
an 80 miles range with FMCOMMS3. Since there are two types of Mode S messages
(56 usec or 112 usec), some messages contain more information than others.

Simulink Implementation
-----------------------

The Simulink model **ModeS_Simulink_libiio.slx** extends the original
MathWorks ADS-B example by adding an IIO System object block
(``iio_sys_obj``) for hardware-in-the-loop signal reception. The signal
detection and decoding subsystem is adapted directly from the MathWorks
reference implementation.

To make the original model compatible with the IIO System object (which
operates in buffer mode), two additional blocks are inserted:

-  *unbuffer* — converts the buffer output to frame size = 1
-  *rate transition* — adjusts sample time to 1

The model supports the same pre-captured and live data modes as the MATLAB
version. Output is displayed in text format in the command window (versus the
table format used in the MATLAB version):
