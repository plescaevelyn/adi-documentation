A transistor is a miniature semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition amplifying and generating these
electrical signals and acting as a switch/gate for them

* Why do we need them?

#. Push a galvanized (zinc coated) screw or nail into the other side of the lemon. The zinc and copper electrodes must not touch.

**Steps**

#. Repeat the procedure for all 3 lemons
#. Connect the lemon cells in series by linking the copper electrode of one lemon to the zinc electrode of the next
#. Connect the Red LED across the battery (copper of first lemon to LED anode, zinc of last lemon to LED cathode)
