Welcome to Analog Devices' System Level Documentation, your comprehensive
resource for prototyping and development with ADI products. This documentation
covers `ADI DataX™ <https://developer.analog.com/solutions/adi-datax>`__ — the
hardware, HDL reference designs, software drivers, libraries, and applications
that together accelerate your path from concept to production.


The ADI DataX Approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADI DataX is an open, multi-platform technology stack that bridges ADI signal
chains and your application. It provides the building blocks you need at every
layer of the stack:

- **Hardware** - Best-in-class ADCs, DACs, transceivers, sensors, and signal chain components
- **HDL** - FPGA reference designs and reusable IP cores (JESD204, SPI Engine, DMA)
- **Drivers** - Linux IIO kernel drivers, Zephyr drivers, and bare-metal firmware (no-OS) for microcontrollers
- **Libraries** - Hardware abstraction (libiio) with multiple backends (local, network, USB, serial)
- **Language Bindings** - Python (pyadi-iio), MATLAB, and C/C++ interfaces
- **Applications** - GUI tools (Scopy, IIO Oscilloscope) and complete Linux distributions (Kuiper Linux)

Rather than reinventing the wheel, DataX integrates with established open-source
ecosystems like the Linux kernel, Python scientific computing, and MATLAB,
allowing you to focus on your application while relying on proven infrastructure.

What You'll Find Here
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This documentation covers everything from individual device drivers to complete
reference designs, organized to help you find what you need quickly. Whether
you're building a high-speed FPGA-based data acquisition system, a low-power
embedded sensor, or a Raspberry Pi prototyping platform, we have the resources
to get you started.
