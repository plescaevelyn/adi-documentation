About
-----

The :git-iio-oscilloscope:`ADI IIO Oscilloscope </>`
is a cross platform GUI application, which demonstrates how to interface
different evaluation boards from within a Linux system.
The application supports plotting of the captured data in four different modes
(time domain, frequency domain, constellation and cross-correlation).
The application also allows to view and modify several settings of the
evaluation board's devices.

Installation
------------

Windows
+++++++

:git-iio-oscilloscope:`Latest releases <releases+>`

Linux
+++++

To build on an embedded target (e.g. aarch64), we recommend using the
:ref:`Kuiper Linux Update scripts <kuiper update>`.
This is a tried/proven method that does everything in a quick script.

To build on a development host (e.g. x86 laptop or desktop) do the following:

#. On Ubuntu or Debian install the following dependencies (see
   :git-linux_image_ADI-scripts:`adi_update_tools.sh#L317-L320`
   for a maintained list):

   .. shell::

      $apt-get -y install \
      $  libgtk2.0-dev libmatio-dev \
      $  libfftw3-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev bison flex libavahi-common-dev \
      $  libavahi-client-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev cmake libaio-dev \
      $  ncurses-dev libserialport-dev libcdk5-dev

#. Install the ``libiio-dev`` package in Debian or Ubuntu or build and install
   the libiio library from source, by following
   :ref:`these instructions <libiio build>`.
   Make sure you do the final ``make install``.

   .. important::

      Users building libiio from source, please use :git-libiio:`libiio-v0:`.

#. Optionally build and install the libad9166-iio and libad9361-iio libraries,
   by following
   :dokuwiki:`these instructions <resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms5-ebz/multi-chip-sync#linux>`.
#. Download the source using git:

   .. shell::

      $git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope.git
      $cd iio-oscilloscope
      $git checkout origin/main

#. Or, :git-iio-oscilloscope:`download a zip <archive/main.zip+>`,
   and uncompress it:

   .. shell::

      $wget https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope/archive/main.zip
      $unzip master.zip
      $cd iio-oscilloscope

#. Build and install:

   .. shell::

      $mkdir build && cd build
      $cmake ../ && make -j $(nproc)
      $sudo make install

   * If you did not do a ``make install`` of the libiio, the libiio install
     location needs to be set in your path (i.e. ``PATH=/usr/lib:$PATH"`` or
     else an error *Package libiio not found..* will occur.
   * If you don't want to do a ``make install``, you will need to make sure that
     the most recently built shared libraries can be found, by setting the
     `LD_LIBRARY_PATH <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html#AEN77>`__
     environmental variable.
     ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./`` otherwise you may get an error like:

     .. shell::

        $./osc
         ./osc: error while loading shared libraries: libosc.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

     Or, worst case, when you are debugging things, you will see your modified
     source code, but it will be running/executing the older shared shared object
     which was loaded (since it didn't find things in the library path).

Ubuntu 20 and Older
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While compiling the IIO Scope for Ubuntu 20 and other older Linux distributions,
you can face issues with the library gtkdatabox. To overcome this problem DON'T
install the library using apt install/ other package managers.
Instead download the sources from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkdatabox/files/gtkdatabox-1/
file gtkdatabox-1.0.0.tar.gz and compile and install it using commands below.
This will ensure that gtkdatabox is compatible with GTK3

.. shell::

   $./configure
   $make make install

Please not that in case some other gtkdatabox version is present in the system
remove it using sudo apt remove. This action can solve error message GTK+ 2.x
symbols detected. Using GTK+ 2.x and GTK+ 3 in the same process is not supported
Trace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)

GTK2 Based IIO-Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to build the previous version of IIO-Oscilloscope, which is based
on GTK2 you will need to install the following packages:

.. shell::

   $apt-get -y install libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtkdatabox-dev \
   $  libmatio-dev libfftw3-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev bison flex libavahi-common-dev \
   $  libavahi-client-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev cmake libaio-dev \
   $  libserialport-dev

Make sure that you have libgtkdatabox v0.9 installed, which was compiled with GTK2.
In addition, you will need to clone a specific branch of the IIO-Oscilloscope
repository, which still uses GTK2 widgets:

.. shell::

   $git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope.git --branch 2021_R2

The other prerequisites and build steps are identical.

macOS
+++++

The recommended method is to use brew with tfcollin's tap:

.. shell::

   $git clone -b fix-gtk-upgrade https://github.com/tfcollins/homebrew-formulae.git
   $cd homebrew-formulae
   $brew install --build-from-source ./gtkdatabox-prev1.rb
   #if necessary: brew link --overwrite gtkdatabox-prev1
   $brew install --build-from-source ./iio-oscilloscope.rb

User guide
----------

Launching the application
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Running Local
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application can run locally which means it runs on the same platform where
your device is connected.

To start the IIO Oscilloscope open up the start menu of your system and search
for “IIO Oscilloscope”. E.g. if you are using a Ubuntu Linux system move your
mouse cursor to the left side of your screen and “Dash home” button and type
“IIO Oscilloscope” into the search box.

Running Remote
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application can be used to connect to another platform that has a connected
device in order to configure the device and read data from it. You can connect
in 3 different ways:

#. Manually:

   .. shell::
      :caption: Run IIO Oscilloscope in remote mode

      # Old:
      $export OSC_REMOTE=<IP address of the remote platform>
      # New:
      $export IIOD_REMOTE=<IP address of the remote platform>
      osc

#. Settings > Connect and enter ``ip:`` and then the IP address in the popup
   window, and click "OK" or "Refresh".

   .. image:: iio_connect_tab.jpg

#. Settings > Connect and click "Refresh" with a blank IP number. If your
   network supports `zeroconf <http://avahi.org/>`__  [1]_, you will be
   connected to the device on the network.

The application can be used to connect to another platform that runs
:dokuwiki:`no-OS software <resources/tools-software/no-os-software/iio>`.

Using the application
+++++++++++++++++++++

Main Window
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: plugin_disconnect_button.png
   :align: left

Each plugin (or tab) can be detached from the main window simply by clicking on
the button placed on the right side of the name of the plugin.
Close the detached window to attach the plugin back to the main window.

The Main Window is designed to display a configuration panel (plugin) for each
device recognized by the system. Additional plugins will be loaded for device
debugging and monitoring purposes such as:

DMM Tab/Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: dmm_plugin.png

The **DMM** Plugin: The Digital Multimeter continuously displays device specific
data once the start button is activated.

-  **Device** tab: Displays the list of all available devices.
-  **Active channels** tab: Displays the list of channels that belong to the
   enabled devices. All channels can be enabled simultaneously by using the *All
   Channels* button.
-  **Right side** tab: Displays data readings of the enabled channels in Active
   channels tab.

Debug Tab/Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: debug_plugin.png

**Debug** Plugin: Is a tool for device debugging. Since "normal" users should
not be doing this, features on this tab may not work unless you have started the
``osc`` application as root (try ``sudo osc`` in a terminal).

-  **Device Selection:** Sets the active device. Once a device is selected any
   other information displayed in the plugin is related to this particular
   device.
-  **IIO Device Attributes:** Allows Read/Write operation for the attributes of
   a device.
-  **Register:** Provides low level access to the registers of the device.

   -  **Detailed Register Map:** When enabled it displays a graphical
      representation of a register and groups the bits by their functionality.
      When disabled the newly displayed option (*Register Map Type*) allows the
      selection of the register map to be used. SPI registers refer to the
      internal registers of the device while the AXI Core registers belong to
      the HDL core associated with the device.
   -  **Enable AutoRead:** When enabled it allows the register to be read
      automatically as the register address changes.
   -  **Address:** The address of the register.
   -  **Value:** The value of the register at the given address.


Hardware Specific Tab/Plugins
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There may be hardware specific plugins/tabs, specific to the platform you are
running on.

Each hardware plugin is documented individually:

Activating Markers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: markers_menu.png
   :align: right

Markers are used for plot data measurement in when looking in the frequency
domain or cross correlations. To activate the markers right click on the plot
and select from the marker menu the type of marker you want to enable. Make sure
the capture process is running and the appropriate domain is selected in order
to enable the markers properly. The following types of markers are available:

-  FFT domain (1 channel enabled): Peak, Fixed and Single Tone markers.
-  FFT domain (2 channels enabled): Peak, Fixed, Single Tone and Image markers.
-  Constellation: Peak marker.

The enabling of a marker will display a set of 5 markers by default. You can add
more markers by selecting Add Marker from the marker menu and remove some by
selection Remove Maker.

Fixed markers are designed to have their position moved by the user. Once the
fixed markers are visible on the plot right click on the marker symbol and while
holding the right button pressed move the mouse to the desired location on the
plot and release the right button.

To disable the markers select Markers Off from the marker menu.

Saving Captured Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In time domain, it is possible to select a capture channel as the trigger source
of the oscilloscope. To do so, right-click on the name of the device used for
capture, and select **Trigger settings**. The pop-up window that will open will
allow you to configure the channel used for the trigger, as well as the trigger
level and edge.

Provided Waveforms
------------------

Several waveforms are provided with the application for demonstration purposes,
which can be loaded into different devices. However, these are generally not
meant for transceiver characterization or demodulation. If you want to do such
tasks, we would recommend creation of your own waveforms from tools such as
:dokuwiki:`MATLAB <resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz/software/basic_iq_datafiles>`.
