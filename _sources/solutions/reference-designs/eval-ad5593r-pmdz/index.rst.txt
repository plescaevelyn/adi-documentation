.. figure:: 5593-3.png

Power Supply Considerations and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the AD5593R Pmod board, the 3.3V power for the Pmod comes
directly from the host board it is connected to. The power from the host
is generally capable of providing up to 100 mA at 3.3V, but for complete
Pmod power specifications please click
:download:`here <pmod-interface-specification-1_3_1.pdf>`.

Device Driver Support
---------------------

There are two device driver solutions that are provided for controlling
the :adi:`EVAL-AD5593R-PMDZ`:

#. **AD5593R no-OS Driver**

   - The :dokuwiki:`AD5593R no-OS driver <resources/tools-software/uc-drivers/ad5592r>`
     is used in bare-metal applications, typically running on low-power,
     embedded microcontrollers.

#. **AD5593R Linux Driver**

   - The :dokuwiki:`AD5593R Linux driver <resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-dac/ad5593r>`
     is used in applications running the Linux operating system,
     typically on larger processors and SoC devices.

   - The AD5593R Linux driver uses the Industrial Input/Output (IIO)
     framework, greatly simplifying the development of application code
     via the cross-platform Libiio library, which is written in C and
     includes bindings for Python, MATLAB, C#, and other languages.
     Application code can run directly on the platform board,
     communicating with the device over the local backend, or from a
     remote host over the network or USB backends.

Loading Image on SD Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to boot the Raspberry Pi and control the :adi:`EVAL-AD5593R-PMDZ`,
you will need to install ADI Kuiper Linux on an SD card. Complete
instructions, including where to download the SD card image, how to
write it to the SD card, and how to configure the system are provided on
the :external+adi-kuiper-gen:doc:`index`.

Configuring the SD Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the configuration procedure under **Configuring the SD Card for
Raspberry Pi Projects** on the :external+adi-kuiper-gen:doc:`index`
page, substituting the following lines in **config.txt**:

.. code-block::

   dtoverlay=rpi-ad5593r

.. warning::

    The EVAL-AD5593R-PMDZ board has a 100k pullup resistor on the
    RESET pin, which correspond to Raspberry Pi GPIO13 and GPIO17 on
    PMD-RPI-INTZ P3 and P4, respectively. The default state of these
    pins is input, with a weak pulldown, but it is strong enough to
    pull the RESET line low.
    Adding the following line to config.txt will switch to pullup:

    .. code-block::

         gpio=13,17=pu,ip

   .. figure:: setup_5593.png

Application Software (All Platforms)
------------------------------------

Hardware Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Libiio is a library used for interfacing with IIO devices and is
required to be installed on your computer.

.. admonition:: Download

    Download and Install the latest :git-libiio:`Libiio package <releases+>`
    on your machine.

To be able to connect your device, the software must be able to create a
context. The context creation in the software depends on the backend
used to connect to the device as well as the platform where the
EVAL-AD5593R-PMDZ is attached. Two platforms are currently supported for
the AD5593R: Raspberry Pi using the ADI Kuiper Linux and the ADICUP3029
running the no-OS AD5593R demo project. The user needs to supply a
**URI** which will be used in the context creation.

The :ref:`libiio iio_info`
command is a part of the libIIO package that reports all IIO attributes.

Upon installation, simply enter the command on the terminal command line
to access it.

For RPI Direct Local Access:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   iio_info

For Windows machine connected to Raspberry Pi:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   iio_info -u ip:<ip address of your ip>

Example:

 - If your Raspberry Pi has the IP address 192.168.1.7, you have to use
   *iio_info -u ip::192.168.1.7* as your URI

.. note::

    Do note that the Windows machine and the RPI board should be connected
    to the same network in order for the machine to detect the device.

IIO Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different commands that can be used to manage and control the
device being used. The :ref:`libiio iio_attr`
command reads and writes IIO attributes.

.. code-block::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_attr [OPTION]...

Example:

 - To look at the context attributes, enter this code on the terminal:

    .. code-block::

        analog@analog:~$ iio_attr -a -C

The :ref:`libiio iio_reg`
command reads or writes SPI or I2C registers in an IIO device. This is
generally not needed for end applications but can be useful in debugging
drivers. Note that you need to specify a context using the *-u*
qualifier when you are not directly accessing the device via RPI or when
you are using the ADICUP3029 platform.

.. code-block::

    analog@analog:~$ iio_reg -u <context> <device> <register> [<value>]

Example:

 - To read the device ID (register = 0x02) of an AD5593R interfaced via
   RPI from a Windows machine, enter the following code on the terminal:

     .. code-block::

        iio_reg -u ip: ad5593r 0x02

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution::

    Make sure to download/update to the latest version of IIO-Oscilloscope
    found on this :git-iio-oscilloscope:`link <releases+>`.

#. Once done with the installation or an update of the latest
   IIO-Oscilloscope, open the application. The user needs to supply a
   URI which will be used in the context creation of the IIO
   Oscilloscope and the instructions can be seen in the previous
   section.

#. Press refresh to display available IIO Devices, once ad5593r
   appeared, press connect.

.. figure:: 5593_iio_connect.jpg

Debug Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^

Below is the Debug panel of AD5593R wherein you can directly access the
attributes of the device.

.. figure:: 5593_debug.jpg

DMM Panel
^^^^^^^^^

Access the DMM panel to see the instantaneous reading of the input
capacitances and the device temperature.

.. figure:: 5593_dmm.jpg

PyADI-IIO
~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`pyadi-iio` is a Python abstraction module for ADI hardware with
IIO drivers to make them easier to use. This module provides
device-specific APIs built on top of the current libIIO Python bindings.
These interfaces try to match the driver naming as much as possible
without the need to understand the complexities of libIIO and IIO.

Follow the step-by-step procedure on how to install, configure, and set
up PYADI-IIO and install the necessary packages/modules needed by
referring to this link: :ref:`pyadi-iio`.

Running the example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing and configuring PYADI-IIO in your machine, you are now
ready to run Python script examples. In our case, run the
ad5592r_example.py found in the examples folder.

.. shell::

   ~/pyadi-iio/examples
   $ python3 ad5592r_example.py

Press enter and you will get these readings.
